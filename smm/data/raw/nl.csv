Why the Rock's on a roll,NL,"For the past six decades, since Newfoundland and Labrador entered Confederation, any transition in the province's political leadership was tinged with underlying pessimism that nothing could really change. However eloquent the leader – and the Rock's leaders are invariably eloquent – the province could never escape the harsh realities of crushing public debt, high structural unemployment, and the mantle of being Canada's perennial doormat. But this time, it's not like that. When Premier Danny Williams retired in late November, he left behind a different kind of legacy – that 2011 will be Newfoundland and Labrador's moment, when the province cashes in on its great promise to become Canada's Atlantic powerhouse. After being belittled by Ontario and the West, and trampled by big neighbour Quebec's nationalistic ambitions, the people in Canada's eastern-most province are poised to become Maîtres chez Newf. They are about to ride a resources bounty, a strengthening fiscal regime, and a resurgent optimism into a new status as a labour and investment magnet. “Those people who once saw us as the poor cousins of Confederation now see us as the place to be: a province on the move,” Mr. Williams said in his retirement statement which, if anything, was more subdued than the economic reality. The spirit of the new age was captured in Mr. Williams' last major act as premier to announce plans for the $6.2-billion Lower Churchill power project in Labrador, a deal that promises to bury some of the debilitating phobias held by people in the province. After four decades of tears and jeers over a bad deal on the Upper Churchill mega-project, the province is poised to cash in on a new hydro project and a new partnership with Nova Scotia. It thus takes an end-run around troublesome Quebec, which not only reaped a sweetheart deal on Upper Churchill but resisted Newfoundland's requests for overland transmission from Lower Churchill. And there is more. Predictions of oil prices hitting $100 (U.S.) a barrel in 2011 leave Newfoundland well-positioned as a petro power, with a constant stream of new and continuing offshore fields. The Hebron field is about to start development, and there are extensions to White Rose and Hibernia. Newfoundland has learned that the life of a resources superpower is choppy and unpredictable. The key is to hold steady in the rough water until price cycles swing back your way. In 2009, the province's GDP plunged by 10 per cent on sharply lower commodity prices. But as energy came roaring back, so did the Rock. The province is expected to have grown by 5 per cent in 2010 and to expand by 3.8 per cent this year, economists at Royal Bank of Canada estimate. Only Alberta and Saskatchewan are expected to show stronger growth in 2011. In addition, the province remains a hotbed of new mineral activity, led by the future promise of the Voisey's Bay nickel deposit and a new nickel processing plant. Tourism remains a strong contributor through television ads that capture the province's raw beauty and history as the cradle of European settlement in North America. The big prize, both economically and psychologically, will come in 30 years, when the Upper Churchill reverts to Newfoundland's jurisdiction – underscoring a dramatic turning point in the balance of Confederation. The province still faces plenty of problems, with public debt improved but not solved. Many public sector professionals feel underpaid and overworked. Rural poverty and depopulation are still critical, as large swaths of the fishery are terminally ill. The challenges of distance and isolation make it hard for the province's budding entrepreneurs to push out from the Rock. But Mr. Williams showed the province can reverse its doormat destiny. Critics may say he coasted on his good fortune as premier when oil hit $140 a barrel and then during the strong rebound from the depths of 2009. But every rich resources economy is inherently lucky. It is what you do with that luck. The example of what not to do is Alberta, which has failed to capitalize on its boom cycles to build a sovereign wealth fund of much scale. Ontario seems destined to fritter away its resource, industrial and location strengths. There are lessons for Newfoundland, as it makes a dent in its public finances and thinks about life beyond penury. Clearly the national game is about to change. The resource players in the Canadian West worry that the seemingly endless stream of able workers from the Rock will soon end, as these folks stay home to work in local projects. When the workers do come home, the test will be how governments deal with talent issues for the next 10 to 20 years. Resources are a fleeting foundation, while training in the industries of tomorrow could move the province to a permanent “have” status. Whatever happens, the new premier will not need to be a chip off the old Rock. Mr. Williams felt he had to be an insurrectionist, with a take-no-prisoners style that earned him the title “Danny Chavez.” His successor can afford to be more conciliatory to Ottawa, to other provinces and to Big Oil. We could see a mature, confident Newfoundland and Labrador, a province that is not just a fighter but a leader – and that, indeed, would be a sight to behold."
Canada must be ready to lead,NL,"Remember the Clipper Adventurer? When the Canadian cruise ship struck a rock in Coronation Gulf while touring the Arctic last summer, stranding some 200 passengers and crew, it took two days for a Coast Guard icebreaker to reach the scene. Mercifully, the weather was fine and the sea calm. Everyone got home safely. But a speedy rescue it wasn't. That's something to ponder as Canada considers taking on a lead role in co-ordinating search and rescue in the Far North. In May, foreign ministers from the Arctic Council group of countries are expected to sign a treaty outlining who does what, and where, in the event of a major plane crash, cruise or tanker ship problem, oil spill or other crisis. Is Canada as prepared as it might be to pull its weight across a vast swath of remote territory? Not everyone is persuaded. Prime Minister Stephen Harper needs to ensure that we don't bite off more than we can chew. Thanks in part to global warming, the resource-rich Arctic is opening up - not only to maritime tourism but also to commercial shipping via the famed Northwest Passage, as well as mining and gas and oil exploration. There's more activity to keep tabs on than ever before. Apart from the cruise ship, two fuel tankers ran aground off Nunavut last year. To his credit, Harper has made the Arctic a priority, investing in the region. Even so, our newest Arctic-capable ships are still in the pipeline. A heavy, three-season polar-class icebreaker, the Diefenbaker, won't be ready before 2017. And the first of a half-dozen Arctic patrol vessels with modest icebreaking capacity and helicopter pads aren't expected before 2014. As Arctic expert Michael Byers sees it, the treaty is a ""timely push"" that ought to galvanize Ottawa to locate more search and rescue resources north of 60, and soon. Byers notes that Canada is the worst-equipped of any of the Arctic countries for search and rescue, given that 40 per cent of our territory is in the Far North. Apart from a few aging planes in Yellowknife, aircraft are sent from bases in Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia, thousands of kilometres away. Byers suggests basing new-generation aircraft or helicopters in the Far North. They'd be better placed to conduct speedy searches, carry rescue crews and supplies, and evacuate injured people. Given that the Harper government plans to build a deepwater port at Nanisivik on Baffin Island, and a military training base at Resolute Bay, that makes sense. There's a need, as well, for more and better airstrips. The search and rescue pact will be the Arctic Council's first important legal instrument binding the United States, Russia, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Before signing on, Canada must be prepared to live up to its obligations."
"Scion of Newfoundland corporate dynasties contributed to the province as businessman, volunteer",NL,"Ian Job Reid was a direct descendant of power brokers who helped shape the history of Newfoundland. His great-grandfather, R.G. Reid, built the Newfoundland Railway through one of the most contentious business transactions in a country, and later a province, where controversial business deals are not unknown. His mother's father, W.C. Job, was part of an enterprise that dominated the salt-fish trade for more than two centuries. Reid was proud of his family history and a successful businessman in his own right, but was not out to influence history. Instead, he left his mark through an impressive dedication to community service. Reid died on Dec. 27 after a long battle with Alzheimer's. “He was a gentle fellow, very controlled,” said former Newfoundland lieutenant-governor Max House, who knew Reid for years, and worked with him in the Stoker's Group of the Rotary Club. “I have never heard him angry with anybody. He was very even tempered, measured, and effective.” Reid's family, House said, was very important to him. “He came from a long line of interesting people.” R.G. Reid first became involved in developing the Newfoundland Railway in 1889. The resulting history is complicated, and produced a political uproar that saw at least one change of government, when Sir Robert Bond's Liberals won the 1900 election by exploiting the issue. The Reid land grants, made under a series of construction contracts, meant that by 1898 Reid owned more than four million acres and was one of the largest private landowners in the world. The contract in 1898 included, among other provisions, operational subsidies of $180,000 a year, land grants of 5,000 acres per operating track mile (not necessarily alongside the railway), timber and water rights, a 50-year operating contract, with the Reids eventually owning the railway in full, and the purchase of the St. John's dry dock. Renegotiations were forced, setbacks and losses accumulated, much to-ing and fro-ing ensued, and by 1931 the company was in receivership, where it stayed until 1956. In 1973 it still held 500,000 acres, which Reid sold to the province for surface rights, for $4.15-million. (The Reids, whose Scottish heritage linked them to the pleasures of angling and hunting, also promoted Newfoundland as a sporting and adventure tourism destination, arguably a prescient precursor to the successful tourism spots of present day.) The Job brothers' businesses, meanwhile, had begun with a partnership of Samuel Bulley and John Job at Prousser's Plantation on the St. John's south side, circa 1750. They first concentrated on exporting cod and importing goods and prosecuting the annual seal hunt. By the late 19th century they were incredibly diversified. They built three sealing vessels, the legendary Neptune, Nimrod and Hector, which supplied 100,000 seal pelts for oil manufacturing in a plant in St. John's. They had fertilizer plants from Catalina to L'Anse au Loop, pioneered techniques for drying fish at stations such as Blanc Sablon, and equipped the 5,000-ton steamship the Blue Peter with a brine freezing system. Through the early 20th century they expanded into, among other fields, canning, mining, and timber, and the Job's stores “permeated the island,” said House. But as the century progressed, their stores and plants were shut, sold, or merged with other companies. Their last St. John's operation closed in 1967. Ian Reid was born Oct. 19, 1925, in St. John's to W. Angus Reid and Gladys Job; he had one sister, Louise. He attended Bishop Feild in downtown St. John's, Ridley College in St. Catherine's, Ont., and then obtained a degree in commerce from McGill. There he met Margot Ross, who was studying nursing at the Royal Vic. They married in 1951 and had five children. At 19 he enlisted with the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve as a seaman on Northern Atlantic convoy duty. He later served with the Royal Canadian Naval Reserve, and was Naval Aide de Camp to Newfoundland lieutenant-governors Leonard Outerbridge and Campbell Leonard Macpherson. As well, Reid was honorary lieutenant-colonel of the First Battalion of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and honorary colonel with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. In 1951, back in St. John's, he spent two years with Martin-Royal Store Hardware Co. Then he worked for three decades with Job Bros & Co. Ltd., a commercial fishing company with insurance, frozen foods and real estate subsidiaries, where he became president. He was also president of Ian J. Reid and Co. Ltd., which still had mineral lands still to be administered, and was a director with Ayre's Ltd., which merged with Job Bros & Co. He retired in 1990, but kept the standards of a gentleman of business. Even after retirement he would pose for photos in a suit and tie. Indeed, he was just as busy. For example, he chaired the board for the Canadian Centre for Fisheries Innovation, founded 1989 by Memorial University and the Marine Institute. Typically, he brought great energy, attention and experience to the volunteer position. “He had a long history with the fishery and business in the province,” said CCFI managing director Glenn Blackwood. “He enjoyed liaisoning with the fishermen and the fish plant owners, which had been such a part of his work with Job Brothers. He was an absolutely fabulous man to work with and work for.” His community work was extensive and significant. Perhaps most important was his decades of volunteering with the Canadian Cancer Society, beginning in the 1950s when cancer was a word people would not even say. The St. John's Rotary Club, the Duke of Edinburgh Awards and the Quidi Vidi Rennies River Development Foundation were among the groups he championed, chaired and campaigned for. Canadian Unity, St. John's Heritage, and school and hospital boards also benefited from his commitment, as did a provincial advisory group dedicated to ensuring rural Newfoundland and Labrador had its fair share of medical coverage. Reid received the Order of Canada in 1997. He leaves his wife Margot and children Ross, Douglas, Jane, Tim and Sarah."
Weird world of doing business with Gaddafi,NL,"BRITAIN is keen to offer Libya ""what it can absorb"" to help secure its burgeoning relationship with Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime, according to Britain's most senior official in the country. Sir Vincent Fean, Britain's ambassador until May last year, also advised other countries ""not to be frightened of the name Gaddafi"", and urged them to engage with the regime. Documents released by the WikiLeaks website to The Daily Telegraph lay bare the bizarre world of Col Gaddafi and the Byzantine structure of his regime - and the West's desperate attempts to do business with him. Col Gaddafi is portrayed as an ""extremely vain"" ruler in the twilight days of his reign who has two personal tailors who make clothes for him adorned with the silhouette of Africa. He is suspected of having Botox treatment on his face and refuses to travel the world without a ""voluptuous blonde"" Ukranian nurse. Diplomats regularly worry about how they can accommodate his needs when travelling abroad. The Libyan leader refuses to stay on the upper floors of buildings and requests to stay in a Bedouin tent when on state visits. The Spanish government had to arrange flamenco dancers for Col Gaddafi during a trip to the country. The documents, written by American diplomats, also set out the secretive deals Britain used to help win over the Libyan regime, including training Libyan judges in the UK, and sending British prison officers to offer advice to their counterparts in Libya. They show how Britain is helping Libya with a wide range of political problems in the hope of winning valuable oil and trade deals. They make clear that the prospect of winning commercial deals is closely linked to political relationships with the regime - even though legally this should not be the case. Britain's approach to Libya was described in comments from Sir Vincent at a meeting in January last year. He told diplomats from the United Nations, European Commission and United States at a lunch in Tripoli in aid of the Gaddafi Development Foundation, a non-governmental body set up by Col Gaddafi's son Saif, that ""it's our job to deliver what [Libya] can absorb, which means starting engagement on their terms"". Sir Vincent encouraged the Americans to engage with Col Gaddafi's relatives, who occupy senior roles in Tripoli, advising them: ""We need to work with what we have in Libya and you shouldn't be frightened by the name Gaddafi. It goes with the territory. Britain was slow to express displeasure with the Libyans when Tripoli tried to replace Scud missiles with Iskander weapons from Russia, despite objections from US officials. Britain has also worked hard to ensure that it is open for business with Libya, the cables show, notably through the state-owned Libyan Investment Authority, which has an estimated $45billion (£28billion) in cash reserves. The authority runs an office in London, where most of its ""primary investments"" are invested ""in banking, residential and commercial real estate"". Mohammed Layas, who runs the fund, told the Americans he ""preferred doing business there [in London] rather than in the United States, due to the ''ease of doing business' in the UK and relatively 'uncomplicated tax system'"". Attempts at building alliances have often been hampered by the erratic behaviour of Col Gaddafi on the international stage - with sometimes relatively innocuous events erupting into full-scale diplomatic crises. In 2009, Libya threatened to nationalise the Libyan operations of PetroCanada, a Canadian oil and gas company, after Canada's foreign minister said he would give Col Gaddafi a ""public tongue-lashing"" over Libya's decision to greet the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi as a hero on his release. The situation was made worse when Col Gaddafi and his 130-strong delegation were handed tourist visas by Canada for a stopover in Newfoundland on a return flight from addressing the United Nations in New York. Within days, the head of Libya's state-owned National Oil Company had contacted the chairman of PetroCanada ""with a threat to nationalise the company's operations in Libya if the Canadian Government did not offer a formal apology"". A group of Canadian tourists were also refused permission to disembark from a cruise ship, while PetroCanada began ""contingency planning to evacuate its staff"" and others faced ""visa difficulties"". The row ended when PetroCanada agreed to cuts its production output from Libyan oilfields. Another row blew up when Swiss authorities arrested Col Gaddafi's son Hannibal in Switzerland in 2008 after claims that he had assaulted members of his staff. The decision prompted an 18-month long diplomatic stand-off, with the ending of direct flights between the two countries, commercial co-operation being ""wound down"" and two Swiss businessmen being arrested on alleged visa and tax irregularities."
"Diplomatic spat with Libya led to threat to seize Petro-Canada assets; Muammar Gaddafi was set to retaliate in 2009 for Canadian criticism over Lockerbie bomber, leaked cables reveal",NL,"The Libyan government threatened to nationalize Petro-Canada's assets and then cut the company's production in the desert nation over a diplomatic dispute in 2009, while Canadian companies with business interests there successfully pressured Ottawa to soften its stance toward Libya's President, secret diplomatic cables reveal. The documents, sent by American diplomats in Tripoli and released by the WikiLeaks website Monday, offer a look behind the scenes at the spat between the Canadian and Libyan governments after Canada openly rebuked Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi for welcoming Lockerbie bomber Abdel Bassett al-Megrahi. The incident began when, on his way home from giving a speech at the United Nations, the Libyan leader decided to stop in St. John's for to refuel his aircraft. The Canadian government announced Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon would travel to Newfoundland to personally chastise him. Mr. Gaddafi cancelled his hastily planned trip to Newfoundland. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene A. Cretz, explains that Canada's ambassador, Sandra McCardell, told the Libyans in mid-September that their President wasn't welcome in the country, as Canada's minority government feared the impression a reception of the Libyan leader would leave on voters. He writes she further said Mr. Gaddafi's last-minute trip would be difficult to accommodate, as it would require issuing visas quickly without extensive security checks for his entourage. The day before the Libyans decided the President wouldn't visit, the National Oil Company called in Petro-Canada's chairman for a dressing down, and said it would seize the company's assets if the Canadian government didn't issue an apology. It set a deadline of the following day. “The Libyans set a deadline of September 28, which [Ms. McCardell] told the Ambassador would be difficult to meet given that offices in Ottawa would open near close of business Tripoli time and after the Canadian weekend,” the cable reads. Ms. McCardell, for her part, argued that Canada ought to issue a message that would indicate the country would welcome the Libyans. A later cable indicates Libya eventually dropped its threat to nationalize Canadian oil assets, but instead demanded Petro-Canada cut its production in half. In a bizarre detail, a Libyan engineer who works for a partner company of Petro-Canada's is quoted as saying the diplomatic row may have been exacerbated by Canada's issuing the Libyan President a tourist, rather than a diplomatic visa. An unnamed Petro-Canada official is said to have told diplomatic staff that he was receiving frequent phone calls from the National Oil Company with ever-changing instructions, and was ready to tell the government to “do whatever you want with us.” “[The official] confirmed that Petro-Canada had prepared contingency plans for repatriating its Canadian staff following reports that the Libyan authorities were planning to “raid” Petro-Canada's offices,” the leaked cable says. Despite the dispute, the Canadian company planned to go ahead with a plan to drill 49 new wells at the start of 2010. “Libya's moves against Petro-Canada, set against the backdrop of an escalating conflict with Switzerland, have left the expatriate business community on edge. Libya's willingness to explicitly link commercial contracts to political disputes has only added to the international energy companies' growing frustration with the Libyan business climate,” it says. In October, Mr. Cannon visited Tripoli and met with the Mr. Gaddafi in hopes of smoothing over the quarrel. The cable says a solution appears to be in sight, but notes speculation the Libya's Prime Minister may have simply been using the spat to gain personal political points. Suncor, the company with which Petro-Canada merged, could not immediately provide a comment on the dispute."
New Brunswick premier brings art of lobbying to Ottawa; David Alward calls out National Gallery of Canada,NL,"jtaber@globeandmail.com David Alward, the new Premier of New Brunswick, a debt-ridden province with an aging population, came to Ottawa for his first official visit this week – and he was worried about the poor representation of N.B. artists at the National Gallery of Canada. Sure, he has concerns over transfer payments, the future of health care and immigration to his rural province, but there is outrage that not one piece of New Brunswick art is included in the federally funded institution's recent showcase of new Canadian works. “Can you imagine?” Mr. Alward said, in an interview this week in Ottawa. Elected premier just last fall, Mr. Alward, 51, has been in provincial politics since 1999. A Progressive Conservative, he won with Bernard Lord, the former premier, and served in his cabinet. He describes himself as a Lord conservative – “fiscally conservative and socially progressive.” Like Mr. Lord, Mr. Alward will not be confrontational on the federal-provincial front; do not expect another Danny Williams, the famously aggressive and disruptive former Newfoundland and Labrador premier. “To each his own,” he said. “I believe you accomplish a lot more around the table than in other ways … but when it's time, it's necessary, you stand up.” Lots of challenges for this province that grows potatoes and not oil and gas – all of which Mr. Alward brought up with the Prime Minister and his senior ministers in his meetings this week. Like his provincial and federal colleagues, wrestling with the economy is a top priority. New Brunswick is facing an $800-million deficit, which he will address in his March 22 budget, the same day Jim Flaherty is expected to deliver his. As part of his efforts to engage the public, Mr. Alward is on Twitter and e-mail – dave@gnb.ca – and so far, he's had close to 10,000 phone calls, notes and e-mails about what he should do in the budget. New Brunswick, meanwhile, is one of the oldest provinces in terms of demographics, as young people are leaving to find jobs elsewhere and fewer babies are being born. It trails much of the rest of Canada, not only in immigration, but in investment in research and development. But Mr. Alward's strategy also includes culture and tourism. In his pitch this week to Industry Minister Tony Clement about research and development and innovation investments, he invited the music-loving minister to the highly anticipated U2 concert in Moncton in July. Mr. Clement is now checking his calendar to see if it's possible to attend – to see Arcade Fire (the Grammy-award winning Canadian band is the opening act) and “that Other Band,” he joked, adding he will be paying his own way. Then there is the issue of the lack of new works from New Brunswick artists in the National Gallery, an irritant that Mr. Alward raised with Heritage Minister James Moore. Between 2008 and 2010, the gallery purchased 400 contemporary Canadian artworks, none of which were from Mr. Alward's province. After a reporter wrote about this, it became an issue in the province. While Mr. Alward was not happy about it, neither was gallery director Marc Mayer, who had some explaining to do. “We have criteria and the criteria is not that we have an equal distribution of artists from each province. We follow where the innovators are,” he said, noting that a curator went to New Brunswick in 2009 and visited 25 artists but found that they were too young and not developed enough. Mr. Mayer notes the gallery is not ignoring New Brunswick. He's been there to give lectures and enjoys the people and his visits. “So we are going to continue going to New Brunswick,” he said. “We might have to wear dark glasses and a wig, but we're still going to come and we're still going to look because that is our responsibility. And one day we're going to come back with some extraordinary things because we know that New Brunswick's got it in them.” Mr. Alward is thinking that might happen sooner rather than later. He and his Tourism and Culture Minister, Trevor Holder, have a plan. They're inviting Mr. Mayer to come to the province to view works by Acadian artists, including Yvon Gallant, Raymond Martin and former Lieutenant-Governor Hermenegilde Chiasson. No politician, meanwhile, can come to Ottawa without engaging in election talk. Mr. Alward did not disappoint, speculating on the upcoming budget. “The question I have is, really, what [is NDP Leader Jack] Layton going to do?”"
Magic as well as mystery in Shetland; The crime novels of Ann Cleeves are helping tourism in 'the last untamed corner'of Britain. Liz Hunt joined the visitors,NL,"It was still dark on the morning Detective Jimmy Perez was called to the Bird Observatory. The storm that had been raging around Fair Isle for days had yet to blow itself out. Angela's body was slumped over her desk, the ivory handle of a knife protruding through the bloody silk of her blouse. In a macabre touch, her killer had threaded white feathers through her long, black hair, like a garland, and ... Sorry, but if you want to know who done it you'll have to read Blue Lightning, the fourth in the bestselling Shetland series of crime novels by Ann Cleeves, in which her hero, Jimmy Perez, investigates suspicious deaths that occur with regularity on this far–flung archipelago (population 22,000) off the north coast of Scotland. Once it was big oil, small ponies, frenziedly patterned knitwear and the annual longboat burning ritual of Up Helly Aa that lured visitors; now it is the lugubrious Perez as fans seek out the real–life inspiration for the literary locations and characters. Tourism chiefs are gleeful. As revenue from North Sea oil dries up, alternative sources of income are crucial. With Shetland recently voted the sixth ''best place in the world'' to visit in 2011 by the Lonely Planet Guide Best in Travel, and holidaying in Britain fashionably acceptable again, they are optimistic that this is a new era for ''the last untamed corner"" of Britain. Cleeves grew up in tamer climes, in Herefordshire and Devon. Her association with Shetland began in 1975 when she was 19, a university dropout who took a summer job as a cook at the Bird Observatory Lodge on Fair Isle, the most southerly of more than 100 islands that make up Shetland. She stayed for two years and met her husband, Tim, who was working for the RSPB there. Since then, Shetland has been her passion: the stark beauty of the landscape, the isolation and rigour of the life, the savage storms and exquisite summer days, and the variety and uniqueness of its fauna and flora. But it is the people, blessed with all the warmth and wariness of those born and bred in a small community, who draw her back year after year. In the middle of the 19th century about 380 people lived on Fair Isle: today the figure is 70, a handful of young families but mostly the elderly or middle–aged, with crofting as their mainstay. And while the island can boast two historic Stevenson lighthouses, a chapel and a kirk – services are held at each on alternate Sundays – it has just one shop and no pub. During bad weather, which can last for weeks, the tiny airstrip is closed and the island ferry–cum–mail boat, Good Shepherd IV, confined to harbour. It wasn't until 2003 that Cleeves began to write about Shetland. A novelist of almost 20 years' experience, she had met with limited success and recognition. That changed on the day a rare coot was spotted on Shetland mainland. Tim, a renowned ornithologist, and Ann, who is resolutely not a birdwatcher, flew up to Sumburgh airport from their then home in West Yorkshire to see it. It was the dog end of the year and freezing cold at Clickimin Loch, just outside the capital, Lerwick. A huge orange sun was hanging low when Ann spotted three ravens on the shore. She was transfixed by the oily, black sheen of their plumage against the frozen snow. ''I thought: 'If there were blood as well, it would be like a fairy story. Snow White with her blood–red lips and all that.' I asked Tim if ravens would feed on a dead body and he said: 'Of course', and so I had the first scene.'' Raven Black was published in 2006 and won the Duncan Lawrie Dagger award for Best Crime Novel. Cleeves, a soft–spoken woman whose Bohemian style and gentle but determined manner hint at her early career as a probation officer, was whisked away on book tours to the United States and Japan, and found herself topping bestseller lists in Scandinavia and Germany. At home, her publisher and fans were clamouring for a sequel. She obliged with White Nights, Red Bones and then Blue Lightning, all of which have been optioned for television. The last book is particularly close to her heart because it is set in the Bird Observatory where her love affair with Shetland began. Her creation, Perez, is a Fair Isle man whose unlikely surname speaks of the ancestry she conjured for him. More than 100 ships have been wrecked off this tiny island, including, in 1588, a remnant of the storm–scattered Spanish Armada, El Gran Grifón (the wreck was discovered in 1970). Some survivors are said to have spent many weeks on the island: is it so unlikely that one or two stayed, perhaps falling for a local girl? Cleeves thought not. Fair Isle, three miles long and 1.5 miles wide, lies equidistant between Shetland mainland and Orkney, and is the best known of the islands. In part this is because of the enduring marketability of its distinctive knitwear – said to be influenced by that brief Spanish invasion – which, for hundreds of years, the islanders used to barter with passing ships. Back then it was gloves, hats, socks and underwear: the pullovers and cardigans came later, their popularity increasing after the then Prince of Wales took to sporting a Fair Isle V–neck through the Twenties. In more recent times, the Observatory and Lodge have helped boost interest in, and the economy of, Britain's most remote inhabited island. Founded in 1948 by George Waterson, who owned Fair Isle (he sold it in 1954 to the National Trust for Scotland), itswork revolves around the daily collection and analysis of data on seabirds and migratory birds and it attracts bird–watchers from throughout the world. Located at the intersection of key flight paths from Scandinavia, Iceland and Faroe, the island provides a welcome temporary haven for migratory birds. The influx begins in late March and peaks in May; early June is the best time to spot the rarities that have the twitchers twitching frantically. During the summer, it is the pungent smell and incessant cries of seabirds – gannet, shag, Arctic skua, great skua, kittiwake, Arctic tern and puffins – nesting on the northern cliffs and hills — that dominate. In late July, the autumn migration begins with waders returning from the Arctic and the Observatory fills with birdwatchers desperate to bag the famous Fair Isle ''specials'': lanceolated warbler, Pallas's grasshopper warbler, great snipe, the yellow–breasted bunting and the Pechora pipit. Which is all very well if pipits and buntings are your thing, but what if they're not? Does Fair Isle offer anything for non–twitchers like me? Ann is adamant that it does. ''You don't have to be a birder to appreciate the beauty of Fair Isle – especially in the spring and summer when there are flowers everywhere and it's light nearly all night. ""I think it's a great place for families with kids because they're welcome at all the island events like dances and barbecues. And even if they're not birders when they arrive, there's something magic about seeing a bird close to when it is ringed.'' The Fair Isle adventure – there is no other way to describe it – begins with a short flight in a seven–seater plane, which is simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying if it's a gusty day, from Tingwall airport on Shetland mainland. The alternative option is a trip of more than two hours – even in good weather it's a challenge – from Grutness on the Good Shepherd IV, which sails three times a week during the summer. And then, well, it is up to you, with a whole island to explore from tiny coves and inlets via peaty hills scattered with sheep to the rearing cliffs of Malcolm's Head. There are numerous walks to suit every ability, several sites of archaeological interest dating back to the Iron Age, and the remnants of a German plane from the Second World War. Seals, whales, porpoises and dolphins are a feature of the summer months, while a small museum and arts–and–crafts workshops cater for visitors curious about island culture. For those who cannot fall asleep without the lullaby of the shipping forecast – ''Malin, Hebrides, Bailey, Fair Isle...'' – then the weather station, run by a crofter, Dave Wheeler (the former keeper at the South Light and the fire chief, who is also airstrip manager and radio operator), provides an insight into how it is compiled. And, as I found to my surprise, it is difficult not to get caught up in the daily duties of the Observatory staff, from the early–morning trap rounds, to see which birds have arrived overnight, to the ritual of the evening log, where, over a drink in the bar, staff and visitors run through what they have seen and where – to be recorded by the warden. The Lodge is working hard to attract more visitors outside peak migratory periods. Last year, a new eco–friendly building, with en–suite bedrooms and family rooms, a laundry and drying room, Wi–Fi and library, was opened, overlooking the tiny beach at the North Harbour. With full board starting at £50 per person per night, children under 12 at £20 and under–fives free, it makes for an economical family break that offsets the cost of travel. My visit was enhanced by idyllic weather and I returned with an understanding of Cleeves' passion for Shetland and respect for those who live there. They are rare birds indeed. For the rest of us, the islands offer a quirky adventure holiday in one of Britain's last genuinely wild environments. Fair Isle Bird Observatory (01595 760258; www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk[http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk]) is open from May 2 until October 31.

"Swallowed By the Sea; As Japan reels from the tsunami, archeologists claim to have discovered the lost city of Atlantis, a fabled place built--like much of the world--in the crosshairs of nature.",NL,"To the grim list of cities and places wrecked and ruined by the indescribably awful majesty of earthquake-powered tsunamis—Sendai and Fukushima most recently, Banda Aceh in Sumatra six years ago, the west of Java more than a century back—must now be added one that is more famous and enigmatic than all the rest: Atlantis. For it now turns out that the island-city that for centuries has captured the public imagination as the world’s oldest philosophical wonderland may well have existed after all—and it may have done so right where it has long been thought to have been sited: close to the eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Beguiling new research into one of archeology’s greatest mysteries appears to have thrown up remarkably persuasive evidence that remains of the ancient city are to be found in the great Hinojos marsh on the southwestern coast of what is today’s Spain. Richard Freund, a somewhat flamboyant professor of Judaica at the University of Hartford, has claimed that the city that has long been regarded—if Plato’s famous description of it as having existed 9,000 years earlier, before Athens, rings true—as the grandmother of human civilization now lies submerged by mud and cottongrass in a part of the marsh designated as a national park a few miles north of the port city of Cádiz. It is a site now padded over by deer and badgers and a few feral camels, nested on by herons and avocets, and overlooked by Spain’s massive expanses of factory-farmed strawberry fields. Moreover, since Plato declared in his writings that “one grievous day and night … Atlantis was swallowed up by the sea and vanished,” it is especially noteworthy that the newly found evidence also suggests it was a deadly Japan-style tsunami that finally caused the city to sink and disappear. Perhaps inevitably, there is much academic squabbling about these new assertions, and some unkindly suggestions of claim-jumping among the numerous scientists who have worked on this latest quest for the site of the “real” Atlantis. But few of the principals dispute the basic claim, made in a recent National Geographic Channel documentary: that a mysterious set of concentric circles that can be easily seen on any good satellite map of the region, when subjected to intense high-tech examination on the ground, show a terrain littered with buried clues of an ancient settlement that appears to have existed there thousands of years ago. There is nothing unusual about the discovery of a new Atlantis site. Earlier candidates have included sites in India, Finland, Sweden, the Bahamas, Crete, Knossos, Troy, the Bermuda Triangle—even Antarctica. But most sensible research has tended to be guided by a few choice words that Plato wrote back in 360 B.C., in his Socratic dialogue known as Timaeus: “In front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, ‘the Pillars of Heracles,’ there lay an island … Atlantis [where] there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power.” This marks the most essential literary clue: that the island-city must have been close to what are now called “the Pillars of Hercules”—the two cliffs marking the mouth of the Mediterranean. In the south is the red sandstone bastion of Jebel Musa in Morocco; in the north, the gleaming limestone massif of the still-British colonial possession the Rock of Gibraltar. Atlantis, most archeologists have agreed for decades, must have been somewhere near Gibraltar. The saga of this new discovery began almost 90 years ago when German archeologists, working on this close-to-Gibraltar theory, supposed that the site of Atlantis was somehow connected to that of another lost city, an eighth-century B.C. Phoenician trading post near the Spanish coast known as Tartessus. Writings, much later than Plato’s, had hinted that Tartessus was probably in Andalucía close to the Guadalquivir River, just to the north of Cádiz—just 60 miles from the British outpost. Then, eight years ago, a pair of German scientists hunting for clues in Andalucía were examining satellite pictures of a large wildlife marshland reserve and bird sanctuary nearby, the Doña Ana National Park. Suddenly they spotted something very odd: a seemingly perfect circular structure set deep in the swamp, with a roadway of some kind leading to the river and a set of rectangular markings nearby. It all looked artificial and quite out of place in an otherwise undifferentiated wilderness of marsh. (The site can be seen by putting in the coordinates 36 57.25N, 6 22.58W onto a satellite map. It is a remarkable site, and you will gasp.) Since Plato had described the city as having been composed of concentric circles, then this, said the Germans, might well be it. In 2006 a group of Spanish archeologists then set out to prove the German speculations. Finding it immensely difficult (the swamp is water-covered for most of the year, drying out only in August), they turned to an American investigator well known for his use of loaned high-tech equipment: Hartford’s Freund. Freund jumped at the chance. He asked his contacts at a Canadian oil-exploration firm to fly in both ground-penetrating radar (which can “see” a dozen feet down) and much newer electrical-resistivity-tomography equipment (which can gaze even deeper). Experts from the University of South Florida’s geography department also came and, along with Freund, a Canadian movie company working on commission for the National Geographic Channel. With the filmmakers busily recording, the electronic detectors promptly found beneath the circles and oblongs visible by satellite a number of enticing layers and straight-line structures that Freund then suggested the Spaniards drill into and otherwise excavate. Within days they had found hard evidence—discoveries of where a circular wall might have been, of a stele marked with carvings of what might have been an Atlantean warrior, of stones decorated with city symbols, of ancient wood dated at 3100 B.C., and of a methane-rich layer suggestive of the sudden simultaneous death of a great number of inhabitants. It looked as though some catastrophe had enveloped the entire community. To prove it might have been a tsunami (to which the Iberian coast has been historically prone: the 1755 Lisbon earthquake saw one of Europe’s worst), Freund went out to sea. He sent down divers, and, according to his claims made in the National Geographic movie, they found enormous quantities of submerged carved stones. Perhaps, Freund said, they were part of the Atlantis wall, wrecked and then dragged out into the ocean by the merciless undertow for which big tsunamis are notorious. Finally, Freund went on to claim the finding, some 100 or so miles away at a number of sites in central Spain, of what he called “memorial cities”—places that were never inhabited, but that the Atlantean tsunami refugees built as miniature, “toy” versions of Atlantis, to remind them of the onetime greatness of their former home. This set of finds, Freund declared, provided the final confirmation. Atlantis, he said he had proved, was in a swamp in Spain, had vanished under a mighty earthquake-generated wave some 4,000 years ago (Plato’s 9,000 years was simply a figure of speech, like saying eons ago), and its inhabitants had fled into the Spanish hinterland to be absorbed back into the local culture. The Spanish archeologists fumed. Their spokesman, Juan José Villarias Robles, accused Freund of parachuting into their site (he spent only a week there, he admits), of making exaggerated claims (there was no wall ever found, said the Spaniards), of publishing “fantastic” and “outrageous” assertions, and of failing properly to acknowledge his “ethical indebtedness” to the Spanish and earlier German workers. But what Villarias Robles does not say—nor does anyone else—is that the claim is basically wrong. Feathers may have been ruffled, rivalries exposed, egos paraded, and personal claims exaggerated—but the main body of facts appears not to be in dispute. An ancient ruin may well have at long last been found. All of which raises some other, more general issues of planetary history, issues that may bring us back to the most worrisome questions that have been raised in the aftermath of the terrible Japanese earthquake. Mythical cities and islands have peppered our history. The Atlantic Ocean in particular is awash with islands that never existed. There was, for instance, St. Brendan, to the south of Iceland (and which Charles Kingsley used as home to his Water Babies book, with its memorably named Mrs. Doasyouwouldbedoneby); there was Antillia, near Bermuda; there was the weirdly named Hy-Brasil, off Ireland; the Isle of Demons, off Newfoundland; Santana, also off Bermuda; and Buss Island, west of Scotland. And ruined cities pepper our present day, too. Cities like Pompeii and Petra, Heliopolis in Egypt and Ayutthaya in Thailand, Ur and Jericho and Babylon in the Fertile Crescent. As tourists, we go and visit them and we take photographs, yet seldom we stop to wonder: why were these cities ruined? Why did Pompeii die, and yet cities like Rome and Berlin and Paris and Moscow, which had their origins at much the same time, continue to exist and flourish? The answer, of course, is that these emptied cities were mostly put down in places where, it later turned out, they should not have been built in the first place. Each was ruined or wrecked by some aspect of its location that made it unsuitable as a building site. Pompeii was in the shadow of a volcano, Babylon was in a waterless desert, Ayutthaya in an indefensible valley, Petra too far from cultivable fields. And so the inhabitants eventually left, or died, and no one ever came again. The United States has long believed it can build its cities wherever it wants to. So it builds New Orleans, below sea level, in a place we now know to be in the bull’s-eye of ferocious tropical storms. It builds Memphis, Cincinnati, and St. Louis perilously close to where this country’s greatest-ever earthquake struck (at New Madrid, Mo., in 1811 ). It builds cities like Tucson and Phoenix in waterless deserts. Most notoriously of all, it builds the city of San Francisco—dead center on top of one of the most mobile tectonic-plate boundaries in the world. So, with the map of Richard Freund’s discoveries in Spain firmly in our mind today, let us ask: what might a map of America look like after 500 more years of earthquake, flood, and fire? Will San Francisco still be there, and New Orleans? Will Memphis have been wrecked by the Missouri fault? Will Oregon have been ruined by giant waves? Will Mobile have fallen to hurricanes? Will some cities have been left derelict and empty, maybe buried like Atlantis, below the mud of a marsh that may by then be famous for its birds and its badgers, but otherwise given over to its true master, the forces of nature? Did the inhabitants of Atlantis ever imagine 4,000 years ago that they would be wiped out by a tsunami overnight? Did the good people of Sendai ever imagine that the same terror might ever be visited on them? Does anyone these days ever take into account what nature can truly do when nature puts her mind to it? That is perhaps what some of us should ponder when we consider the fate of Atlantis. For is the fate of that fabled city likely, in the end, to be our fate too? Winchester is the author, most recently, of Atlantic."
Commodities-rich Newfoundland enjoying perks of ‘have-not' past,NL,"bmckenna@globeandmail.com Anyone who still believes Newfoundland is a have-not province should take a close look at its latest budget. The province is forecasting budget surpluses of $485-million this year and $59-million the next. Yes, that's black ink. The province is on track to generate a combined $5-billion in surpluses between 2006 and 2012, according to its budget tabled last week. Newfoundland is steadily paying down its debt and ramping up spending. While much of the rest of the country hunkers down, the budget provides more money for schools, hospitals, child care and infrastructure. It's also selectively cutting taxes and freezing university tuition, already near the lowest in Canada. Newfoundland's economy is red-hot, growing 5.6 per cent last year. It's forecast to expand 3 per cent this year. It's also leading the country in job creation. Credit the global commodities boom. There's been an unexpectedly large windfall from surging offshore oil and mining royalties. Commodities booms come and go, of course. But something more lasting has happened in the six decades since Newfoundland joined Confederation. It's become increasingly self-sufficient. This is no longer the province of failed boondoggles, collapsing fisheries and boom-bust forestry. Today's boom is based on long-term investments in offshore oil, hydroelectric power, nickel and tourism. The population is growing again after years of outmigration. Many baby boomers who left the Rock to seek a better life in the Alberta oil patch or the big cities of Central Canada are coming home to retire, building big homes up and down the Avalon Peninsula. And yet Newfoundland still enjoys most of the privileges of its have-not past. It is a beneficiary of large federal transfers ($1.8-billion this year, representing a quarter of government revenue). Other major federal programs, such as employment insurance, are also badly tilted in the province's favour because of a preponderance of seasonal work and a high structural jobless rate. All Canadian workers pay in to employment insurance, but Newfoundlanders are among those most likely to qualify for full benefits. Nine out of 10 unemployed Newfoundlanders get EI, compared with only four out of 10 in Ontario, where part-time work, self-employment and a surplus of new entrants to the labour force disqualify many. These kinds of inequities have long stirred resentment in the traditional “have” provinces of Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. But the grumbling is getting louder. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty lashed out at the federal government's recent pledge of $4.2-billion in loan guarantees for the Lower Churchill hydro project in Labrador. “Ontarians should understand 40 per cent of the federal government's money comes directly from Ontarians,” he complained. “… Ontarians will not stand by and let their tax dollars be used by the federal government to subsidize electricity rates in other parts of the country.” It isn't just about fairness. It's about building a stronger national economy, critics say. In a February report, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce said transfers of $40-billion to $50-billion a year from the wealthiest provinces to lower-productivity regions are wrecking the country's economy. Ottawa is “actively punishing productivity and rewarding inefficiency, and doing so on a large scale through regional subsidies,” argued the report, Dollars and Sense: a Case for Modernizing Canada's Transfer Agreements. It said equalization and other transfers suck up roughly 5 per cent of the combined economic output of Alberta and Ontario. “It is a regional subsidy system that punishes productivity, rewards inefficiency, does so on a massive scale and is difficult to change,” the report concluded. “It is so large that it almost certainly outweighs all other steps taken by the federal government to improve Canada's productivity performance.” This might not matter if Ontario's economy were growing at a blistering pace. It's not. Under Ottawa's complex formula for calculating equalization, Ontario was officially labelled a have-not province in 2009. Even so, it continues to pay more into the system than it takes out. The consequences of decades of financial neglect are now evident in health care and education. Per capita, there are fewer doctors, nurses, hospitals and universities in Ontario than in most other provinces. Newfoundland, in contrast, ranks near the top. The country is changing, but the federal system seems rooted in the mindset of the 1950s."
Places of sublime beauty - Parks Canada entices new generation to savour 'NATIONAL TREASURES',NL,"In 1911, when J.B. 'Bunny' Harkin was appointed Canada's first commissioner of national parks, he thought ""the word park seemed a very small name for so great a thing."" The number of visitors to the Canadian Rockies at mountain parks now known as Banff, Jasper, Yoho, Glacier and Waterton Lakes was increasing and the federal government felt it needed to protect the magnificence of the region. ""Wonder, reverence, the feeling that one is nearer the mystery of things -- that is what one feels in places of such sublime beauty,"" Harkin wrote. This year, Parks Canada celebrates its 100th anniversary. It was the first national parks service in the world. Today, it administers 42 national parks, 167 national historic sites, including nine canals, and four national marine conservation areas. The mandate is unchanged: ""Dedicated to the people of Canada, for their benefit, education and enjoyment... to leave unimpaired for future generations."" Considered an international leader, the agency is celebrating successes at the same time as it works to attract a new generation of Canadians. ""The people of Canada care about their national treasures,"" says Alan Latourelle, Parks Canada chief executive officer. ""Our objective is to connect people to these great places so they can be proud of the exceptional system of stories and geography that we have in Canada. The key to their long-term future is an engaged citizenry."" Today, 180 countries have national parks. The first was Yellowstone National Park in 1872 in the United States, which was ""too big and too beautiful to belong to any private individual,"" according to one its proponents. In Canada, the first national parks were created in the Rockies (Banff was third in the world). Visitors arrived by rail and stayed in hotels built by the CPR. ""The idea was not conservation, it was tourism,"" says Jonathan France, director of the historical research branch of Parks Canada. ""The main objective was an economic one, to show a return on the significant public investment in building a transcontinental railway."" Harkin remained parks commissioner until 1936. Born in 1875 in Vankleek Hill, Harkin had previously worked as a journalist and a political secretary. He promoted national parks for recreation and as a source of valuable tourist dollars and built roads for public access. But he was also quick to develop the idea of conservation, noting man ""is constantly changing the face of nature, cutting and burning the forests, plowing up the wildflowers, killing off the wild animals and birds, damming and polluting rivers, draining and diverting lakes."" In 1915, the agency designated three antelope sanctuaries in Saskatchewan and Alberta and in 1917 the Migratory Birds Protection Act was passed. This established protection of wildlife on federal lands as part of Parks' mandate and led, among other initiatives, to the creation of Point Pelee national park. Moose, elk, deer and smaller animals flocked to the newly created sanctuaries. ""It was touching to observe how soon they discovered that within these areas they were safe,"" Harkin wrote. In the 1920s, Harkin was in frequent conflict with business interests that wanted to exploit coal, timber and water in parks, leading him to enshrine their inviolability in the 1930 National Parks Act. ""The day will come when the population of Canada will be 10 times as great as it is now but the national parks ensure that every Canadian by right of citizenship will still have free access to vast areas possessing some of the finest scenery in Canada,"" he wrote. At the turn of the century, hiking, camping and canoeing were becoming popular and enthusiasts sought to protect the wilderness where these activities took place. Today, one of the challenges faced by Parks Canada is a lack of comfort with camping. A recent survey found many Canadians didn't feel they possessed the skills to be in the outdoors. ""There's a fear of the unknown for places you would think would feel very comfortable for Canadians,"" says Andrew Campbell, director general of Parks Canada's visitor experience directorate. ""People are getting further and further away from nature."" He cites urbanization and a diverse population. Last year, there were about 22 million visitors to the parks, down from 25 million a decade ago. Parks Canada is targeting youth, giving free passes to Grade 8 students and last summer sponsored 32 young filmmakers to produce videos for online sharing. For urbanites, some parks provide less rustic accommodations such as walled tents with real beds. Plans are in the works for programs to teach people how to camp, light a campfire and cook outdoors. New Internet planning tools, such as the Explorer Quotient, help visitors identify what they would enjoy best, be it kitesurfing, joining an archeological dig, having a family picnic or sitting by a quiet lake. Some citizenship ceremonies take place in national parks and historic sites to introduce new Canadians to them. ""How can we continue to have our places be meaningful and really have Canadians connect to them?"" says Campbell, ""That's our biggest challenge."" For scientists, the goal is to maintain ecological integrity even as climate change melts glaciers and permafrost in northern areas. They have restored bison and the blackfooted ferret, thought to be extinct, into Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan. The agency's scientific systems and co-operation with aboriginal people are admired by other countries. Its ecological restoration guidelines are in the process of becoming international. The recent expansion of the Nahanni National Park Reserve in the Northwest Territories to 30,000 square kilometres is a landmark conservation achievement. It protects much of the watershed and a population of more than 500 grizzly bears. ""It really becomes a globally significant protected area,"" says Parks Canada chief scientist Stephen Woodley. ""Protected areas are seen as a critical way to preserve the Earth's biodiversity."" Other recent successes include the creation of Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve and Haida Heritage Site. This is a world first -- a protected area that extends from Alpine mountain tops to the deep sea floor. Parks Canada recently completed a massive restoration of lakes and rivers impacted by past logging practices in La Mauricie National Park. And in Banff National Park, the agency is using wildlife exclusion fencing and creating a minimum of 20 new wildlife-crossing structures in Banff National Park so animals will be able to safely cross the Trans-Canada Highway. Parks Canada is working on nine new parks. The goal is to represent Canada's 39 natural regions through the parks system; to capture a comprehensive representation of Canada's flora, fauna and geology. One of the new planned parks, Mealy Mountains of Labrador, would otherwise likely have been clear-cut, says Latourelle. ""Oftentimes, places where we have national park potential there's mining, oil and gas, forestry and ranching potential,"" he says. ""Governments have to make difficult choices."" Given development pressures and urban sprawl, ""We're the last generation that still has the opportunity to complete the national park system so future generations of Canadians will get to experience the diversity of Canada,"" says Latourelle. --Postmedia News Parks Canada by the numbers 42: number of national parks 22M: annual number of visitors 167: number of national historic sites (includes nine canals) 95: percentage of satisfied visitors $609M: annual budget $3B: impact on the economy Fun facts about Canada's parks Established in 1885, Banff National Park was Canada's first.

ROCK SOLID; Newfoundland's emerging cuisine is high end and surprisingly innovative,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, NEWFOUNDLAND -- ST. JOHN'S, NEWFOUNDLAND-I came to St. John's to eat. And sitting here in Bacalao Restaurant, a modern bistro in a century-old home in one of North America's oldest cities, I can't help but congratulate myself as I bite into a sophisticated crispy fritter of salt cod and potato. ""We call it the Bacalao fritter. So, it's a fancy fish cake, seasoned with garlic and Newfoundland savoury,"" explains owner Andrea Maunder. Tonight's tasting menu is all about nouvelle Newfoundland cuisine. Tender medallions of Labrador caribou; pot-caught cod from Fogo Island; and an upscale Jiggs Dinner, rolled in a cabbage leaf, steamed and served with a pot-liquor shooter. Familiar flavours all, but in new presentations - this, I quickly learn, is Bacalao's stock in trade. Tucking into dish after dish, it's clear this is a culinary experience not found anywhere else. St. John's, the lively port known for music and good humour, is emerging as a destination for foodies as passionate, innovative, and in some cases newly proud locals put Newfoundland cuisine on the map. Take Bacalao, already turning heads for its hyper-local cuisine. From the art on the walls to the Quidi Vidi beer on tap, everything is sourced as local as possible. ""We've always been proud of Newfoundland tradition in home cooking, but nobody was doing that,"" says Maunder, who moved back to her hometown with husband, and chef, Toronto-born Mike Barsky. They hit at the right time. Once, many Newfoundlanders scoffed at the thought of others wanting to try the food served in the homes, she says. ""Oh, I got nothing fancy for you,"" might once have been the refrain in a province that has relied on sustenance from the sea, game from the land, and native berries such as bakeapples, partridgeberries and blueberries. But there's a new attitude blowing through town. ""Things have changed dramatically,"" Brace says. ""It's really exciting to finally see our food be considered a class of food and to have people from all over the world come to eat Newfoundland food."" The next day I sit at the downstairs bar of Chinched Bistro on Queen Street watching co-owner Michelle LeBlanc infuse a cocktail with partridgeberry preserves-a delicious Newfoundland take on the cosmo. She tells me instructors at the Culinary Institute of Canada are encouraging students to take their training in Newfoundland, such is the foodie renaissance. Chinched - it means to stow away, to be stuffed, in the Newfoundland Dictionary - is another new star. Like Bacalao, its focus is on local. LeBlanc bakes her in-demand house bread using Quidi Vidi's Eric Red beer and snack menu offerings such as salt cod hush puppies. It's a far cry from the dining scene of just a decade ago. ""Ten years ago there wouldn't be any gourmet artisan chocolate shops in St. John's. They wouldn't have made it,"" says Brent Smith, chief chocolate officer at the Newfoundland Chocolate Company on downtown Duckworth Street. Newfoundland humour is decidedly at play in the melt-in-your-mouth chocolates, hand-turned in the shop. Take ""The Danny"" (""rich, but a little salty""), a truffle created after beloved former premier Danny Williams announced his surprise resignation. That such a niche specialty exists and thrives is a sign of the shift that's hit a Newfoundland capital once hard done by the collapse of the cod fishery, says Smith. Offshore oil has spurred economic development. Perhaps most exciting is how revitalization is championing local culture. From bistro to brewery, I'm regaled with history in every dish. And if it's the food (reason enough) that's brought me, it's the people I truly savour. Like dentist Hilary Rodrigues who started Newfoundland's first winery in Markland after discovering the region's homemade partridgeberry wines. He wondered why no one did it commercially. The reaction? ""Who would buy Newfoundland wine?"" Turns out plenty. Today, Rodrigues and his son Lionel use the bounty of the land to make kosher, sulphite-free, natural fruit wine, brandy, vodka and liqueur. At Quidi Vidi Brewery, the two engineers who converted a former fish plant into a brewery surrounded by granite cliffs, bobbing boats, sea otters, eagles and seals, are crafting beer with glacial waters from 25,000-year-old icebergs. They've named their beers after Newfoundland history. Iceberg beer was a natural fit. ""This is the only place in the world where icebergs drift along our shores,"" says co-owner Dave Rees. My last evening I reserve for Raymond's, the highly anticipated, elegant waterfront restaurant longtime friends Jeremy Charles (the chef) and Jeremy Bonia (the sommelier) opened in November 2010. With 16-foot ceilings, dangling chandeliers, and floor-to-ceiling window views of Water Street and St. John's perfectly sheltered harbour, it stuns. Over dinner with tourism veteran Kathi Stacy of Carbonnear I ask about the foodie nirvana sweeping the city. ""For a long time, Newfoundlanders were kind of afraid in some ways to express themselves. We always knew who we are and we're proud of Newfoundland. But now we want to put ourselves out there as a destination. We want to show you who we are as a people."" As we speak, our server Joel brings the amuse bouche, a moose-ravioli-flavoured soup, and later steelhead trout from Bay d'Espoir. It's all outstanding, from the made-in-house pasta to house-made lemon cream cheese ice cream. ""Ten to 15 years ago, you had two options for dinner,"" says Smith of the Newfoundland Chocolate Company. ""Now you can go out for a first-class meal any night of the week. There is so much pride in the place."" JUST THE FACTS DOING: Start your trip by driving or hiking up iconic Signal Hill. The city skyline stretches before with inspiring views of the waterfront, The Rooms (the provincial art gallery, archives and museum), the famous jelly bean row houses and the Atlantic Ocean as far as the eye can see. It's a view that never gets old. SLEEPING: With its connections to the Titanic (a grand staircase carved from English White Oak, supplied by the same craftsman and built during the same time period, 1909-11), a newly opened spa, and century-old architectural charm, the five-star Ryan Mansion is lux lodging. It's hosted Prince Charles and Camilla-the Royal Suite rents for $585 a night. Other options start from around $200 and deliver plasma TVs, L'Occitane en Provence bath amenities, and en suites with heated carpera marble floors.

Newfoundland pulls ahead of Maritimes with oil and mining boom,NL,"OTTAWA -- There was a time when the economies of the four Atlantic provinces were virtually indistinguishable, rising and falling on the fortunes of fish, farming and forests. But Newfoundland and Labrador's remarkable oil and mining boom is creating a new chasm – between the haves and have-nots of Atlantic Canada. Its economy is powering ahead, while those of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island languish, weighing on the nationwide recovery. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI are on a pace to come in dead last this year and in 2012 on virtually every economic measure, including GDP, employment, capital spending, housing starts and consumer spending, according to new forecasts from several of the major Canadian banks. And the three provinces are starting from an already weak base. Workers and businesses in the three provinces are still waiting for the bounce-back from the recession, said Elizabeth Beale, president of the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council. “We did not see the same hit in the region from the recession as they did in Ontario and other provinces, and now we're not seeing the pickup coming out of it,” Ms. Beale said in an interview. “It's worrying to look out and see a lack of large project development. It's not the only thing that can save an economy, but it's pretty telling that there's no big investment out there.” The lack of opportunity has reignited fears of an out-migration of workers from all three provinces. A rising trend of young workers leaving would perpetuate the cycle in the country's three poorest provinces, putting the social fabric at risk. “The region is still quite rural, and that's where a lot of these resource industries are based,” said Ms. Beale. “When those industries die, so do those rural communities. So it has quite an impact on provincial output when you have so much of your activity concentrated in sectors that are retreating.” Canada as a whole will grow 2.9 per cent this year, according to a forecast from National Bank of Canada. Contrast that with the Maritime provinces, where growth isn't expected to break 2 per cent. The way out, at least in the short-term, is not clear. Nova Scotia is pinning its hopes on getting a piece of two pending multibillion-dollar federal shipbuilding contracts. But that's not a given, and government cutbacks are expected to sap growth. New Brunswick is counting on mining, potash and natural gas developments to make up for lost jobs in forestry. Success at diversification into other areas, such as call centres, has been mixed as a lot of that business has moved to cheaper places, like India. In PEI, the tourism industry is suffering from the high loonie, which is keeping U.S. tourists away. Federal and provincial spending sustained Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and PEI though the recession. And now that the stimulus spending is receding, it's becoming evident there's little other activity to fuel expansion. Exports to the United States have been hammered by the high dollar and, in the case of the forestry sector, by the U.S. housing collapse. “The clearest indication of the lack of activity is private sector job growth, and in those provinces we're not seeing any right now,” pointed out Robert Kravcic, a Bank of Montreal economist. Through the first four months of the year, private sector employment expanded at a 4-per-cent clip in Newfoundland. It shrunk everywhere else – 1.9 per cent in Nova Scotia, 1.5 per cent in New Brunswick and 0.4 per cent in PEI. “The loss of young workers is the top concern for the region,” Ms. Beale said. “As Alberta's growth has jumped up again, so has the flow of young people out of the region.” It's the polar opposite in Newfoundland, where workers are increasingly scarce because the mining, oil and government sectors are all in full expansion. The province is now experiencing the kind of overheated labour market that once afflicted Alberta, raising concern there won't be enough workers to bring a series of mining and oil projects on stream simultaneously, APEC's Ms. Beale said. After leading the country with growth of nearly 6 per cent last year, Newfoundland's economy is expected to grow another 3.7 per cent this year, just narrowly behind fast-growing Saskatchewan. Investment activity is at a record pace in Newfoundland, led by work on the offshore Hibernia South and Hebron oil fields, as well as iron ore and nickel projects in Labrador. Spending on major projects is expected to rise 49 per cent to $6.2-billion this year, after rising 30 per cent in 2010, according to an inventory compiled by APEC. “They're throwing money around wildly,” Ms. Beale remarked. Contrast that to the other three Atlantic provinces, where project spending is down anywhere from 8 to 19 per cent. With the exception of Newfoundland, which is flush with oil and mining royalties, fiscal restraint is the order of the day. In New Brunswick, for example, government capital spending is being cut 30 per cent in fiscal 2011-12 – a hit that's coming while its most important industry – forestry – is suffering due to the U.S. housing collapse. Nova Scotia is working on a plan to keep program spending increases at just 1.3 per cent a year through fiscal 2014-15, a cold shower compared to the five per cent-plus annual growth of recent years. It also plans to cut one in 10 government workers over the next four years. “There's some pretty significant fiscal restraint coming down the pipe,” Mr. Kravcic said. “It doesn't bode too well for the forecast.” Nova Scotia's economy is more dependent on government spending than any other province, pointed out Ms. Beale. “A large government sector offers you some modest protection at times, but anytime restraint is happening it knocks the stuffing out of Halifax's economy,” she said."
Feel-good car show of the year - 'Bentley tourists' join enthusiasts at first-ever Collector Car Appreciation Day,NL,"There's no denying that Winnipeg has hosted some amazing car shows over the years. Still, if you're a veteran automobile buff, you may sometimes feel as if you've been there, done that and have the T-shirt to prove it. We may be the cruising capital of Canada, but the reality is we haven't had a fresh venue to showcase our automotive passions for a number of years. That's what made the city's first-ever Collector Car Appreciation Day so special. The event, masterfully organized by the Manitoba Association of Auto Clubs (MAAC), was held last Friday at the Manitoba Legislative Grounds, Memorial Park and a short stretch of Broadway Avenue. In case you missed it, more than 300 local cruisers and hundreds of spectators showed up for this festive event that paid tribute to our city's long-standing love affair with classic and special-interest vehicles. While the vast majority of vehicles on display have been seen around town in the past, it was the amazing location that really made this event special. The sun was shining, the Golden Boy was watching over us, and we were surrounded by beautifully manicured lush green grass and a sea of flowers in full bloom. I really can't imagine a more picturesque location to host a car show, and for a few magical hours it actually felt like I was a tourist in my own hometown. For me, the most interesting proof of this event's success -- and the true 'community' nature of our hobby -- came from a pair of travellers who've been touring the country in a classic Bentley. Robin Hines and his longtime friend Neil Stephenson recently shipped Hines' 1926 Bentley roadster from England to Halifax and started an epic road trip that mirrors a similar trip Hines' father Jeremy made more than 30 years ago. The pair picked the car up in Halifax but opted to undertake a true nationwide tour, so they drove the car to Newfoundland and started there. Hines was actually born in Victoria, B.C. but moved to England with his father as a child. He recently moved back to Canada and wisely decided he had to bring his rare Bentley along with him. ""The car was purchased new by my grandfather, passed on to my father and now belongs to me,"" said Hines, who noted that it has been running great and they're right on schedule. Although the pair have received a warm welcome across the country, Hines offered that he was totally amazed with the hospitality they received here in Winnipeg. Example: local Mopar collector Pat Kaniuga arranged for the use of a garage so Hines could do an oil change, inspect the gearbox and rear axle and install some fresh spark plugs. The car is a 1926 Bentley 3.0-litre with a straight four-cylinder engine. Highlights include twin magnetos, with twin spark and four valves per cylinder. According to Hines, it can run all day long at 100 km/h and has been averaging more than 20 miles per gallon on their journey. The reaction to the car when it roars down the highway is typically one of shock, he said. ""They don't expect us to be traveling so quickly in such an old car."" There is no support vehicle with them and, while cargo space is at a premium, they've got more than enough room on the car's running boards to strap down their luggage. Asked if Winnipeg was living up to its reputation as Canada's classic and special-interest vehicle capital, Hines heartily agreed. ""You're really such a friendly lot here -- the reception has been quite exceptional and the motoring clubs here are fabulous,"" he said. ""This attention has all been quite unexpected and we will always have fond memories of Winnipeg and your tremendous generosity."" After a few minutes chatting with Hines and Stephenson, I was reminded that the passion Winnipeggers have for our hobby is just as rare as our cars. Celebrating in such a scenic spot resulted in the feel-good auto show of the year. Here's hoping that Collector Car Appreciation Day becomes an annual event. Willy@freepress.mb.ca"

"We love our town. But will you? City marketing campaigns need to work across the board – for business, education and tourism. And they need the ring of truth",NL,"Since June, when Mayor Naheed Nenshi and others donned bright red T-shirts to launch a new national marketing campaign, Calgary has been showing its true colours. Called “Be Part of the Energy,” the campaign aims to make Canadians choose this oil-and-gas capital as a place to work and do business. A partnership between Calgary Economic Development and local companies, Be Part of the Energy arose from the booming city's chronic labour shortage. Its effort includes a website, advertising and social media activity. The campaign's slogan plays on Calgary's identity as a young, vibrant city built on the energy sector, says Mary Moran, director of marketing and communications at Calgary Economic Development. “We purposely made it an invitation and a call to action for people to consider Calgary if they're considering a change either in business or in life,” Ms. Moran explains. “It was really important that we were able to tell a broad story.” While developing the campaign with two consulting firms, Ms. Moran and her colleagues had to weigh perceptions of their city. Some people think the home of the Calgary Stampede is a redneck town, she admits. But on the other hand, Ms. Moran kept hearing that Calgary could do more to promote its lifestyle, cultural and business assets. Calgary Economic Development, which wants to make its Be Part of the Energy campaign international, also studied other cities' marketing and branding strategies. It needed a catchphrase with mass appeal, but buy-in from local residents was crucial, too. “The key is to ensure that it resonates with the people of your city,” says Ms. Moran, citing the long-running “I Love New York” campaign. Cities need strong branding to compete with their global rivals for increasingly mobile talent, capital and businesses, says Greg Clark, a London, England-based adviser on city and corporate strategy and investment. But if city branding is more important than ever, it's also more complex. Thirty years ago, it was enough to develop an investor brand or a visitor brand, Mr. Clark explains. But today, people looking for a city with a good university might also be thinking about opening a business there – or about how their parents would enjoy the place as tourists. Cities must create a brand platform that can operate across those markets, says Mr. Clark. “The idea that you can separate a distinctive brand position for investors versus visitors versus others doesn't really work so much any more.” Most big cities have branding efforts, Mr. Clark says. Even if they started with a strong inherited brand – think London or Paris – fierce competition has made them far more brand-focused. The cities that rank highest have a distinctive identity and a clear lifestyle proposition, he says. They've also got a potent iconography, whether it's buildings, an attitude or a way of life. City marketers should avoid over-promising, warns June Cotte, associate professor of marketing at the University of Western Ontario's Richard Ivey School of Business. “You don't want to market the city you want to be,” Prof. Cotte says. “You want to market what you can actually deliver to people.” The challenge, Mr. Clark says, is “not just to get the identity right or to get the iconography right, but to also get the reputation and the messaging right.” Hong Kong, London and New York may not be perfect, but they do market themselves well. “There's a sense in which these brands are real and authentic and true, and they do convey that these are great cities to do business in, they're great cities to study in, they're great cities to visit, they're cities that are innovative,” Mr. Clark says. Over the past decade, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary have emerged with strong lifestyle and livability brands. But Canada obscures their business proposition by promoting itself abroad as a land of forests and snowcapped mountains, he argues. In 2010, the Regina Regional Opportunities Commission launched a new city brand identity with the tagline “Infinite Horizons.” The commission's chief, Larry Hiles, quickly realized that it takes a long time to build brand equity. The slogan needs to be backed up by meaningful improvements. “We need to keep delivering the meat behind the brand,” Mr. Hiles says. A city brand is the experience that people have, not the story the city tells about itself, Mr. Clark says. Branding should be part of an improvement process, he urges, from repairing infrastructure to getting the cab drivers to live that brand a little more. “Otherwise people are selling a product that isn't working.” ***** HITS AND MISSES Greg Clark, an adviser on city strategy and investment, dissects three urban brands. Success: Aarhus, Denmark “It's gradually establishing its identity as a centre of alternative technology on the one hand and alternative lifestyle on the other. It's a very small city by global standards, but it has been very effective at communicating to the international community that this is a place that's absolutely serious about being in business in the things that the world really needs.” Failure: Melbourne, Australia “They've been very good at communicating that they're a city of sports and a city where interesting things happen. But they've not been so good at communicating their business proposition. And as a result, they're finding that increasingly, business is moving from Melbourne to Sydney.” Work-in-progress: Miami, Fla. “It had 10 years of branding failure when it didn't know whether it was a retirement community for elderly North Americans, a new tourist resort for young, hip people, or the future business gateway for Central America, the Caribbean and large parts of Latin America. The reality is, it's all three of those things, and it has to communicate all three.” Nick Rockel"
Parks & speck; Tiny Sable Island is Canada's newest national reserve,NL,"It is just a long, slender, green bean of a thing, but this dune off the cold coast of Nova Scotia is anything but a harmless strip of sand. Its swirling waters are known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic, for they have swallowed 350 ships since 1583. Its underwater Scotian Shelf hosts 18 shark species that feast on the island's grey seals. The island is tall and narrow - 40 kilometres in length, and only 1.5km in width - and its body is held together by a skeleton of beach grass that traps the sand granules and the pirate wreckage buried within. Hundreds of untamed horses run wild, their matted manes unruly in the blustering wind where the Labrador current collides with the warm Gulf Stream and breeds thick fog. This is Sable Island, a crescent-shaped mass roughly 300 kilometres out to sea. On Monday, Sable Island was formally named a Canadian national park reserve to ensure, the environment minister said in a statement, that the ""iconic"" and ""fabled"" island will be protected for all time. No one knows for certain who first discovered or settled Sable Island in the 1500s. Was it Joao Alvares Fagundes, the Portuguese nobleman, or was it another Portuguese claimant named Diogo de Sam Bardao? Or was it Baron de Leri, whose only claim stems from stories told by a French author? Or was it, in fact, first settled by French convicts abandoned there as the captain searched for the ideal site to colonize? They might have later been joined by another shunned group - the mentally ill, whose wealthy relatives reportedly banished them offshore for a fee paid to the island's superintendents. And how did the horses - upward of 400 of them - get on the island, anyhow? That story has it that a reverend from Boston sent people and livestock to Sable Island in 1738, in a bid to settle and prosper. Years later, by the early 1800s, the Nova Scotia government set up the Humane Establishment to take in shipwrecked survivors until a rescue vessel arrived from the mainland once or twice a year. Today, the island is home to a bird sanctuary, two 300-year-old lighthouses once staffed by men with names like Bungay and Noonan, a shallow lake deemed ""the spa"" by temporary government workers and two long-time, mostly permanent residents - Gerry Forbes, who works for Environment Canada's Atmospheric Monitoring Section, and Zoe Lucas, a researcher who is said to have moved to the island in the 1970s. Neither could be reached on Monday. Sheila Hirtle, a researcher who co-wrote Sable Island: The Strange Origins and Curious History of a Dune Adrift in the Atlantic with her husband, Marq de Villiers, visited the island in October 2002 after receiving permission from the Canadian Coast Guard. She remembers the waves tangling in a mess of crashing white caps, refusing, for some reason, to roll ashore with any patterned reason. She remembers the horses as curious creatures, pausing in packs to ""examine us foreign beings standing upright on two legs."" And she remembers the supersonic planes bound for New York, unleashing the ""sound of a cannon at about 10 o'clock each morning"" as they broke the sound barrier overhead. That Sable Island itself is so void of human life is what makes it feel like no other place on Earth, said Ms. Hirtle, who lived in government quarters for four days. She brought her own bedding and food. When she left, she took her garbage. ""When you're there, it feels like you're on the moon,"" she said. ""There's just an incredible loneliness on the island. You can see boats going by as they travel to the oil rigs, you can hear planes overhead, but you have no connection to any of it."" But it is also unlike the moon, her husband later chimed in during a telephone interview. ""There's no stone, no rock - not even a pebble - on the island,"" Mr. de Villiers said. ""Years and years ago, a drill was sent down 10,000 feet, and they found nothing but sand."" Now that Sable Island is a national park, rigs are prohibited within one nautical mile of its shores, and its surface will never again be drilled.

Danny Millions' latest gig is developer,NL,"Flamboyant former Newfoundland premier Danny Williams has a really big idea for his ""booming"" hometown. Williams, 62, wants to build a $5 billion, nearly 1,000-hectare multi-use development in the west end of St. John's that could take up to 20 years to complete. And he's the sole developer. ""I am just back doing what I like to do ... creating employment and just making Newfoundland and Labrador a better place to be,"" Williams told the Toronto Star Wednesday. ""And I actually mean that, that's not political bull---- I'm giving you here. ""It's a big project"" and if he makes ""a few bucks along the way,"" even better, says Williams. With any luck the project, which could start as early as the spring, would include 4,500 homes, 325,160 square metres of retail space, and 260,128 square metres of industrial space, he says. Currently, the only development on the site is the 18-hole Glendenning golf course he built several years ago. The land is adjacent to St. John's, Mount Pearl and Conception Bay South, all of which are rapidly growing municipalities, Williams said. ""It's a town within a city. That's what it's going to be,"" he said, adding that he is awaiting ""very routine"" approvals on zoning before submitting a master plan to the city. He bought the land in the 1990s at public auction before he got into politics. Williams said he has had interest from shopping consortiums, movie theatres, big-box stores and companies desperate for industrial space. ""The province is booming. A study came out just this week showing that Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan and Alberta will be leading the country in growth,"" said Williams, a lawyer and a businessman whose net worth has been estimated at $180 million. The former premier made his fortune before entering politics when he sold off Cable Atlantic. Williams says the time is right to go ahead with a development that's been in the works for the last 20 years but one that had to be put on hold when he was premier. St. John's Mayor Dennis O'Keefe told the Star he expects provincial approval could come as early as January and shovels to be in the ground by March. ""It's an ideal time for all of this to happen. The economy is very positive."" O'Keefe credited the boom times to offshore oil and gas; the fact that St. John's has become a centre for ocean research and technology; tourism; and natural resources and hydro power."
No more happy campers: We are the new punks at home and abroad,NL,"erenzetti@globeandmail.com The Canadian Tourism Commission is running a new series of ads on British television designed to draw visitors to our fair land. I say new, but really the images form a familiar parade of Canadiana: There are adorable bear cubs sliding down a snowy slope, kayakers in Newfoundland marvelling at glaciers, a seal with an intact skull enjoying some cute interaction with another kayaker. I kept waiting for pictures of the tar sands to appear, considering how proud we are of them, but perhaps black, black and brown-black weren't festive enough colours for the season. I think they were using pretty much the same images in the commercials of my childhood, a steady maple syrup drip that continues to this day. Canada, land of happy campers, unbothered seals, pristine snowscapes. Peaceful, tolerant, compassionate. Suddenly it all looks so out of date. The world – and, not to put too sharp an edge on it this close to Christmas, our country – is a nastier place. The time has come for a different international campaign, one that jibes with our tough new image on the global stage. Replace the snow boots with 20-hole Doc Martens, and the fluorescent ski pants with vinyl bondage trousers and you come closer to the motto that should be ours: Canada: We're the New Punks, and Don't You Forget It. We're already most of the way there. The rage, contempt for rules and operatic profanity that echoed around the streets of London and New York as punk discovered its voice in the mid-1970s seems to have found a natural home in Ottawa. This week's vitriolic goings-on in the mosh pit – sorry, the House of Commons – reminded me of a show I once saw by the Canadian punk band NoMeansNo. That may be a bit of an exaggeration: One was a raucous display of hurled abuse and testosterone-fuelled spectators itching for a fight, while the other provided some great music. For comparison's sake, it's probably a good idea to watch the era-defining showdown between the Sex Pistols and middle-aged interviewer Bill Grundy, which took place 35 years ago this month. “Piece of shit” said MP Justin Trudeau to Environment Minister Peter Kent, using the word Johnny Rotten had shocked tea-time audiences with years before. Goaded and taunted by the powerful, the victim responds with the only weapon in his arsenal, contempt. In Britain, the country's jaw dropped. Three decades later CBC announcers delicately picked their way around the steaming mess, referring to a storm of “s-h-blank-t.” One thing: If we are going to be the new punks, our national news organizations will have to kill their euphemisms – perhaps they can be buried in the same box with the Kyoto accord. Contempt's having a ripe old year, isn't it? A good thing, because that's what drives punk, the speed in its veins. Never mind peak oil, this year we reached peak contempt. It was, after all, a charge of contempt against Parliament that caused the Conservatives' minority government to fall earlier this year, and the lack of indignation over that little transgression that caused the government to roar back, its boots bigger than ever, the spikes on its collar even shinier. Perhaps, this is what Britain's Prospect magazine meant when it wrote a piece about macho new Canada: “the country that used to be synonymous with soft power is getting more muscular.” Face it, people: Anne Murray's gone and Mad Max is here to stay. Which other misfit nation would curl its lip against world opinion and shoot down a treaty that might benefit all? (You know you're a bad boy when Russia's your only friend and even China's waving a sorrowful finger at you.) Who else would flip the bird at expert advice and continue to export asbestos to developing nations? Speaking of the bird, in what other country would the mayor of the largest city be accused of treating a mother and her six-year-old daughter to an obscene hand gesture? He may deny it, but I think they've been watching The Filth and the Fury down at Toronto City Hall again. In the last decade, “punked” came to mean something else – pulling a particularly cruel and humiliating prank on someone who wasn't in on the joke. Pretending to set his house alight, or spray-painting his car – or, indeed, phoning the voters in his riding and pretending that there's a by-election pending and the incumbent doesn't intend to run. I'm not sure Irwin Cotler saw the humour in being punked, but hey: Welcome to the new north. It's bitter out there. Of course, there are those who will pine for the old Canada – accommodating, reasoned, the envy of nations. Maybe we could get them T-shirts printed with Johnny Rotten's most famous line: “Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?” We could even put a little maple leaf over the “i”."
LABOUR CRUNCH; $43-BILLION IN NEW PROJECTS. THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS. 13% UNEMPLOYMENT. ONE PROBLEM.,NL,"LONG HARBOUR, NFLD. -- Rinaldo Stefan has a tough challenge as he manages construction of Vale SA's sprawling, $3-billion nickel processor on Placentia Bay: finding enough skilled workers to complete the job on time and on budget. Mr. Stefan must find 1,500 welders, electricians, plumbers and other workers by next summer, on top of the 2,000 already on the job. But due to a shortage of available skilled tradespeople in Newfoundland and Labrador, Mr. Stefan is now in a mad scramble to fill the positions, placing advertisements across Atlantic Canada to entice qualified workers. “We are working hard to find the people we'll need,” said the native of Romania, a construction project manager for Vale, the global mining giant. “For the moment, we are looking in Canada, but the contingency plan will be to go offshore to find people.” Newfoundland and Labrador is in the midst of an unprecedented energy and resources boom that is straining the province's ability to keep up. Finding enough workers to complete some $43-billion worth of major projects under way and planned is proving to be a monumental challenge. Workers are building nearly a dozen buildings that will house the Vale refinery on the steep, wooded shores of Long Harbour about 100 kilometres west of St. John's. After construction winds down in 2013, the plant will produce 50,000 tonnes per year of nickel that Vale mines at Voisey's Bay in Labrador. But to complete construction, Vale needs to find armies of skilled workers. Recruiting ‘from away' Vale is not alone. Employers in the province are having trouble hiring tradespeople for new projects and other positions, even as thousands of people continue to leave home to find work elsewhere – notably Alberta's oil fields – even as Newfoundland suffers a 13.2-per-cent jobless rate. As a result, companies are now recruiting potential employees from “away” – as far away as Ireland – for positions that aren't being filled by local people. “We've got employers at this table regularly saying to us that they're concerned about the labour pool and they need labour,” Premier Kathy Dunderdale said in an interview at her St. John's office. “We know it's a problem.” The skills gap is a problem in other parts of Canada. Across the country – from the oil sands of Alberta to diamond mines in the North – companies are finding it difficult to attract workers, a shortage that threatens to play havoc with project economics by driving up labour costs and delaying construction schedules. But deep structural problems in Newfoundland and Labrador's labour market have led to a serious mismatch between the province's labour force and the needs of employers. Local unemployment While the jobless rate remains stubbornly high, many of those listed as officially unemployed are seasonal workers in industries such as fishing and tourism. They often live in rural communities, work for a few months and then survive on unemployment insurance. At the same time, Newfoundland and Labrador has an aging population, with the highest median age in Canada. Older workers are less willing to move to where jobs are, and less eager to shift gears and train in the skills that employers need. Younger people have left the province in droves: the population of Newfoundland and Labrador fell by nearly 75,000 people – or 13 per cent – to 506,000 between the early 1980s and 2007. And it tended to be young adults who moved away. Come home or stay put One of the biggest challenges is to persuade Newfoundland's tradespeople to either come home or stay put. The province estimates that 20,000 Newfoundlanders travel out of province for work – some 90 per cent of them are men, and half go to Alberta. “You resign yourself to the fact that this is what you have to do, to live on the lifestyle I have. Because I'd never live the lifestyle I have here on minimum wage – or even $25 an hour wouldn't do it,” said Gerard Kean, who lives in Renews, a small town 100 km south of St. John's. Most of his career has been out of province: he started in the oil industry offshore Newfoundland, but now has a more lucrative job working on windmills in the North Sea. Fuelled by mining and offshore oil, Newfoundland boasts one of the best growth stories in the country, and a lengthy roster of looming megaprojects. Beyond skilled workers, it needs engineers, project managers, accountants and other service sector employees that grease the wheels of an expanding economy. With oil prices near $100 (U.S.) a barrel, activity in the offshore is picking up again as firms like Chevron Corp. and Norway's Statoil ASA pursue new discoveries. Meanwhile, a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp. is preparing to build a production platform for the $8.3-billion Hebron offshore development that will include a massive concrete base to be constructed at Bull Arm on Trinity Bay, and drilling and housing superstructures that will create fabricating work in St. John's and around the province. At the same time, provincially-owned Nalcor Energy is preparing to break ground on the $6.2-billion Muskrat Falls hydro project on the Lower Churchill in Labrador, subject to final approval. The province's mining sector is also booming, particularly in western Labrador where iron ore companies are building mines to feed China's seemingly insatiable appetite for steel. But no one is quite sure where they'll find the manpower. Hebron and Muskrat Falls together would require some 5,700 workers, the large majority of them skilled trades people. “It is not inconceivable they could slow things down if the labour market becomes so tight there are not enough people to complete the projects,” said Fred Bergman, senior analyst with the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council. “Where will those people come from to fill these jobs?” Addressing the skills gap The provincial government is eager to address the skills gap issue, knowing a shortage of skilled workers would not only hold back development but represent a failure to ensure its citizens are benefiting as much as possible from the growth. The government increased by nearly 50 per cent the number of apprenticeship spots at the St. John's College of the North Atlantic, but the province worries that employers appear reluctant to take on trainees, and would rather import journeyman workers. “If they see shortages now but they're not willing to participate and hire apprentices and move them through the system, in years to come they'll have no supply of labour,” said Advanced Education and Skills Minister Joan Burke. Competing on wages, benefits Employers see a ready work force that flies in and out of the province on a regular base, from home to remote workplaces. But many, including Vale's Mr. Stefan, say they can't compete with the wages and benefits that are offered in the Alberta oil sands, where tradesmen regularly earn triple-digit incomes and live in well-appointed camps that offer a wide range of amenities. John Kearney, CEO of Labrador Iron Mines Holdings Ltd., is planning ahead. The company is growing in Labrador and is expanding its construction work force there as production grows from 600,000 tonnes per year to 3 million tonnes. “One of our main challenges is how to compete with the oil sands in Alberta,” Mr. Kearney said. “Whether they are going to fly in and fly out to northern Labrador, or fly in and fly out to Alberta – it's only the difference of a couple hours on a plane.” Labrador Iron Mines hasn't hit a labour crunch yet, but it still has fairly modest demands. As part of the answer, Mr. Kearney has turned to aboriginal communities, which now account for 25 per cent of the work force. But many of those workers need training. Over the longer term, Mr. Kearney worries about wage inflation undermining project economics as the company tries to lure workers to the remote border area of Labrador and northern Quebec. Union leader Lana Payne says companies operating in Newfoundland and Labrador are going to have to improve pay scales and quality-of-life issues like scheduling, while devoting more resources to training. “Is this a skills shortage or is it just a wage shortage? Or that working conditions need to change here in Newfoundland and Labrador?” asked Ms. Payne, president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour. Will the work last? She said Newfoundland's construction workers don't yet believe there will be a steady stream of work, and are unwilling to make major changes – or give up seniority at current work sites – to take short-lived jobs at home. Her biggest fear is that employers like Vale and Rio Tinto's Iron Ore of Canada are looking to fast-track foreign people through a temporary worker visa program, which Ottawa has touted as one answer to the skills shortage being experienced across the country. But employers argue they are sometimes left with little choice but to look abroad, and that the province needs to attract immigrants as well as returning Newfoundlanders in order to address its demographic challenges. Fred Cahill, president of St. John's-based GJ Cahill Group, a large construction company, said his firm has plenty of work, “but the biggest concern is how you get the work done.” He said the federal government needs to continue to streamline policy to help alleviate skilled-worker shortages, while the province needs to attract more skilled immigrants. GJ Cahill was among the companies that participated last month in a provincially-organized immigrant recruiting trip to Ireland, where crippling unemployment has followed the housing boom and bust. Mr. Cahill called it a “prospecting” trip. “There are a lot of skills there out of work that we need,” he said. Ms. Burke, the skills minister, is sensitive to the foreign-worker issue, having lived in the province as it struggled with chronic unemployment. “I'm only really comfortable with temporary workers from outside if I'm convinced that the people who live right here in Newfoundland and Labrador have had every opportunity to fill those positions.” ***** ‘COLLISION COURSE' Canada's booming energy and resource sector is confronting a chronic skills shortage that threatens to become acutely painful as the country's aging and urban work force is increasingly out of sync with industry's needs. Economists say the shortage will get worse with an expected capital-investment boom by resource companies feeding growing demand in Asia, and by the power sector rebuilding an aging electricity infrastructure. Over the next decade, the Canadian economy is forecast to require 319,000 additional workers to cover retirements and job growth, according to the Construction Council of Canada. But there will only be 163,000 new entrants, given Canada's current demographics, creating a shortage of 156,000. The energy industry is particularly hard-pressed, said Eugene Lang, co-founder of Canada 2020, an Ottawa-based think tank. He warned that two major economic forces are on a “collision course” – unprecedented slowing of labour market growth and unparalleled investment in energy projects. “A comprehensive federal-provincial labour market strategy is needed to ensure energy projects can proceed with minimal labour supply constraints,” Mr. Lang said.

Canada adrift in troubled Arctic waters,NL,"MURMANSK, RUSSIA -- An Arctic winter storm is a vision of terror for seamen: hurricane force winds battering heaving decks encased in thick ice, an ordeal that can drag on for days cloaked in darkness. So far north, rescue teams are usually a very distant hope. The sinking of a Russian oil rig Sunday in a howling gale off the coast of Sakhalin, on Russia's Far East coast, left 53 crew members confirmed dead or lost at sea, and added a new chapter to the harrowing lore of Arctic navigation. Yet as the Arctic climate warms, and vast polar ice sheets melt, international shipping companies are eagerly eyeing two routes across the top of the world - one along Russia's northern coast, the other through waters claimed by Canada. Russia has a decades-long lead in controlling its Arctic coast. If Canada doesn't catch up in claiming territory, the country may not have the power to decide who navigates the Northwest Passage through a sweeping archipelago of more than 19,000 Canadian islands. Losing control over access to the waterway could cost Canada any chance of profiting from escort fees and other tolls if climate change permanently opens the meandering route through often tight channels. Northerners say Arctic storms, which can blow for weeks, have been getting stronger and more frequent in recent years, and climate experts warn that is likely to become a long-term trend if average temperatures continue to climb. That jacks up the stakes in the competition to draw international shipping into the Arctic and away from the old warm water shortcuts between Europe and Asia - the Panama and Suez canals. By far, the most developed Arctic passage is Russia's Northern Sea Route, which cuts almost a third off the journey between East Asia and Europe through the Suez Canal, a transit that has marked the global economy's pulse for decades. The Suez is a growing headache for shippers, with near constant risks of political trouble and unrest, pirates and other hazards that add steep insurance costs to the long list of fees that Egypt and various agents charge. More than 17,000 vessels paid Egypt's government a total of $4.7 billion last year for the privilege of avoiding the longer haul around the southern tip of Africa. Russia is eagerly rebuilding its Northern Sea Route to take as much as it can of that action. Ships carried a record 757,400 tonnes of freight through the route this year, mostly natural gas, iron ore and fish products, according to Russia's transport ministry. Foreign vessels accounted for 88.7 per cent of that total through the passage, which was open more than 141 days, longer than last year by a whole month and setting a record for an Arctic shipping season. Russia's great ambitions for its Arctic sea lane include a federal agency to collect the transit fees, said Anton Vasiliev, Russia's ambassador at large for Arctic issues. By the end of the decade, Russia expects up to 59 million tonnes of cargo to pass through the route, with another 30 per cent surge by 2030, Vasiliev said. Increasingly, that cargo will include crude oil carried in supertankers, which environmental activists fear will be too vulnerable to breaking up in the Arctic's crushing ice and storms. MURMANSK, the largest city anywhere in the Arctic, celebrates its 100th anniversary next year and the Kremlin is planning to make it the hub of a re-energized transportation network. Murmansk alone expects to receive $10 billion in public and private investment by 2019 for improvements to railways, a renovated airport, new port facilities for cargo and tourist cruise ships, oil and natural gas facilities, and other projects. ""I can tell you for sure that with Putin and (President) Dmitry Medvedev, this is not an issue of 'whether we should develop the North,' "" said Evgeniy Nikora, speaker of the Murmansk region's legislature and a Putin ally. ""Definitely, all of the necessary decisions have been taken at the federal level for development of the Arctic in Russia. Now, we can instead talk about the competition between Russia's Arctic regions, as to which can be more attractive to investment."" Having something to contribute to the success of the Northern Sea Route is one of the best ways to attract the Kremlin's attention and financial backing. Sometimes called the Northeast Passage, the route runs through Russia's coastal territory and has been under Moscow's undisputed control since the Soviets opened it to commercial shipping in the early 1930s. Canada lays claim to a possible rival, the legendary Northwest Passage, which only saw its first foreign commercial ship transit in the fall of 2008: a cargo vessel that sailed from Montreal with supplies for four hamlets in Nunavut. Powerful maritime nations, including the U.S. and members of the European Union, consider the Northwest Passage an international strait open to any who want to risk navigating the ice and narrow channels. But Canada wants to control access. That's a costly proposition because, unlike Russia, Canada doesn't have anything close to the Arctic infrastructure that's needed, such as ports, 24-hour rescue stations and an ice-class fleet required to patrol the passage. Canada's Arctic weakness was obvious to former French prime minister Michel Rocard when he took a six-day Arctic trip on the Coast Guard icebreaker CCGS Amundsen in August. Rocard, France's ambassador to international negotiations on the Arctic and the Antarctic, called Canada ""too small to finance by itself the infrastructure"" needed to make the Northwest Passage a viable shipping lane. ""I have the impression that Canada has given up on the competition to attract a large part of the traffic in 25 or 30 years,"" Rocard said after his ride on the Amundsen. In 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government didn't sound very enthusiastic about the potential for the Northwest Passage when Ottawa declared its northern strategy. ""Although the Northwest Passage is not expected to become a safe or reliable transportation route in the near future, reduced ice coverage and longer periods of navigability may result in an increased number of ships undertaking destination travel for tourism, natural resource exploration or development,"" the government said. By contrast, Putin has staked nothing less than his country's economic future on the Arctic, and rebuilding the Northern Sea Route is a pillar of his national security strategy. ""We are planning to turn it into a key commercial route of global importance,"" Putin told an international forum on the Arctic in the Russian city of Arkhangelsk in September. ""I'd like to emphasize that we see its future as an international transport artery capable of competing with traditional sea routes in cost of services, safety and quality,"" he added. Russia's Security Council has ordered a new network of 10 emergency response and rescue centres to cover some 5,500 kilometres of the route. More than $294 million will be spent to build facilities and renovate old ones at the centres, said Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu. The new Arctic security force will include 590 ground and sea-based units and 384 aviation units, according to Shoigu, who did not disclose the number of personnel that would be deployed. Some in the West fear this as a disguised and destabilizing military buildup. But the Russians insist the units will only guard against terrorists, smugglers, illegal fishers, and other interlopers, as well as rescue law-abiding seafarers in trouble. They will also be deployed to man-made disasters, including any in the growing number of oil and natural gas drilling rigs anchoring off Russia's northern coast. ""Even with very sober eyes, we don't see any militarization of the Arctic, and we don't see ourselves as having any part in the militarization of the Arctic. It's crazy,"" Vasiliev said. It's only prudent for any Arctic nation to improve security in the Far North because climate change, and the rapidly melting ice that come with it, are creating openings for intruders and other dangers, he added. ""Anyone could come in and violate the border regime, bring this narco-traffic, illegal immigration and organized crime - whatever you can imagine - all these bad things,"" Vasiliev said. ""Don't we need more armed forces to protect ourselves from that?"" Vasiliev continued: ""It's the same for Canada. Oil rigs in the Arctic Ocean are a potential target for terrorists and need to be protected."" But Putin's fresh show of force includes a multi-billion-dollar program to build a new generation of nuclear submarines to patrol the Northern Sea Route. Subs armed with nuclear warheads sound like dangerous overkill, even to critics of Putin inside Russia, where suspicions are running high that the Russian leader cynically stirs up tensions with the West to undermine political opposition at home. After announcing an order last month for five new Yasen class nuclear subs, at an estimated cost of $1.3 billion each, Putin assured the Russian legislature that the Kremlin intends to show some nuclear muscle on the Northern Sea Route. ""We will also beef up our military bases there, and we will certainly increase national security in the North,"" he said in a reply to a member of parliament's question. The Kremlin also plans to add three nuclear-powered icebreakers, designed to operate in rivers as well as the ocean, and six diesel-electric icebreakers to its fleet before 2020. Ottawa still hasn't set a start date for construction of a new Polar class icebreaker promised in 2008. THE U.S. isn't doing much to challenge Russia's dominance of commercial shipping in the Arctic. A huge September storm stopped a barge from delivering 5.7 million litres of winter fuel to Nome, on Alaska's west coast, and then sea ice closed the only delivery route. The approach was too shallow for the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy to help. Both American heavy icebreakers were being repaired, so the small native community called in the Russians. They dispatched the double-hulled, ice-class tanker Renda from the eastern city of Vladivostok to bunker fuel in Incheon, South Korea, and then haul it to Nome by year's end. Russia is also planning a string of seven floating nuclear reactors to power and heat Arctic mines, remote towns and oil and natural gas facilities. Each reactor will cost as much as $600 million. Rosenergoatom, the state-run firm that built the first one, says it will test whether the plan makes economic sense. The company hopes it can sell the floating reactors to other countries, and with steady production, bring down the cost. The first floating reactor, called the Academician Lomonosov, was launched last year from the Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, only to be held hostage in a dispute between investors. If it ever reaches Arctic waters, the double-hulled steel vessel - 140 metres long by 30 metres wide - will have two on-board nuclear reactors pumping out 70 megawatts of electricity through undersea power cables to power stations, said Vladislav Sozonyuk, the company's head of analytics. That's enough to power a city of 100,000 people. ""The design is supposed to withstand a strike by an aircraft, and other artificial impacts,"" Sozonyuk said. Russian nuclear experts at Bellona, an environmental group based in Norway, say the floating reactors are an unnecessary and risky attempt by Russia's nuclear industry to save itself after the collapse of the Soviet Union. First, it floated the idea of removing missile tubes from discarded nuclear submarines, transforming them into undersea cargo ships able to navigate beneath thick Arctic ice. That was abandoned as too costly, so planners turned their sites on the lucrative oil and natural gas business, according to Bellona's research. Now the plan is to build drilling complexes on the seabed, with floating reactors supplying the power and heat required to keep the hydrocarbons flowing, said Andrey Zolotkov, chairman of Bellona's Murmansk branch. It sounds like science fiction, but ""nothing is strange in Russia,"" Zolotkov said, with a weary shrug. ""I don't think we will ever be able to say that nuclear power facilities are absolutely safe,"" Zolotkov said. ""And a floating power plant, in my view, is even more hazardous than an icebreaker."" To some, it's just another step in a complex and dangerous social and economic experiment started in the 1930s, one that has yet to prove that developing the Arctic is cost-effective and safe for a fragile environment. They back up their argument with numbers on the steady exodus of people from Russia's Arctic. In the two decades since the Soviet Union broke up, the population has fallen by some 35 per cent in Murmansk region alone, where a little more than 800,000 people now live. Even rich incentives held over from the Soviet days haven't stopped the exodus as state-run factories close because they can't compete in a capitalist economy. Russian law mandates subsidies for housing in the Far North, along with higher wages, better pensions and 24 extra days of vacation. Workers still on the state payroll, who account for roughly half the workforce in Murmansk, get an added bonus: a free ticket out, once every two years, including a 30-kilogram baggage allowance. Nikora, the regional legislature's speaker, conceded that improving labour efficiency and attracting young people to the Arctic are two of his government's biggest challenges. BUT PRIVATE Murmansk-based businessman Alexander Lebedev complains he can't get anywhere with officials as he lobbies for reforms that he says would cut his labour costs and improve profits. Lebedev, who is trying to sell green-energy technology in a market dominated by state-owned oil and natural gas giants, has lost half his staff in recent years, but was only able to cut his payroll by 20 per cent. He had to pay his remaining workers more and boost their benefits, to keep them. Meanwhile, his electricity bills shot up by 50 per cent this year. Lebedev was born in the Arctic, and so were his parents. His grandparents settled in the Arctic in 1924. Now he's struggling to keep their legacy alive. ""We realize we have only one option in the Arctic - to fight for it,"" he told the Star, sounding unsure how it would all work it out."

Conley says the battle over Santa's back yard is heating up as the U.S., Russia and others vie for control of the melting ice caps Santa Claus may see you when you're sleeping, but NORAD makes sure it sees Santa pretty much round-the-clock. The North American Aerospace Defense Command not only follows Saint Nick's sleigh ride with its famous NORAD Tracks Santa site, but it is also involved in a struggle over resources, border control and broader military presence right in Santa's vast and magnificent home: the Arctic. In April, President Obama signed a new command plan that gives NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command greater responsibility in protecting the North Pole and U.S. Arctic territory. The Arctic region - covering more than 30 million square kilometers and stretching around the territorial borders of Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United States by way of the Alaskan coastline - is transforming before our eyes. And not just because the ice is melting. It's increasingly the site of military posturing, and the United States isn't keeping up with the rest of the world. In 2009, Norway moved its operational command to its northern territories above the Arctic Circle. Russia has plans to establish a brigade that is specially equipped and prepared for military warfare in Arctic conditions. Denmark has made it a strategic priority to form an Arctic Command. Canada is set to revitalize its Arctic fleet, including spending $33 billion to build 28 vessels over the next 30 years. Even China has entered the Arctic race; it constructed the world's largest non-nuclear icebreaker to conduct scientific research in the Arctic. September marked the lowest recorded levels of sea ice in the Northern Polar Region. The polar ice cap today is 40 percent smaller than it was in 1979, and in the summer of 2007 alone, 1 million more square miles of ice beyond the average melted, uncovering an area of open water six times the size of California. As quickly as the polar ice cap recedes, commercial opportunities in the resource-rich Arctic advance. The Arctic is governed by the U.N. convention on the Law of the Sea. That framework allows a coastal state to have exclusive economic control 200 miles off its coast - and possibly to extend authority 600 miles beyond, depending on certain scientific claims. In the 21st-century Arctic, large corporations and countries are racing to reach and capture the abundance of offshore oil and gas as well as iron ore, nickel, cooper, palladium and rare-earth minerals. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the Arctic contains 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil resources and 30 percent of its gas resources. And as the ice melts, cargo transport could increase from the 111,000 tons in 2010 to more than 1 million tons in 2012, according to some Russian estimates. It's not just a natural-resources race. Cruise ships take eco-tourists to see the North Pole, stunning Arctic coastline vistas and endangered species such as beluga whales and polar bears - for $24,000 to $35,000 a head. In addition, international scientists search for climate-change clues in Arctic permafrost conditions, ice dynamics and glaciers. Fishing trawlers hunt for lucrative fish stocks. The Arctic has always been a grounds for competition, both over and under the ice. In the early 20th century, it was a race of great explorers and visionaries. The Canadian American Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, known as the ""prophet of the North,"" had the foresight to understand the Arctic's strategic importance and economic potential despite a disastrous expedition. During World War II, the United States rushed to develop supply routes by air and by sea. The country needed to reach the Soviet front and fight off any possible Japanese invasion of Alaska. The Cold War Arctic meant racing to defend against and deter Soviet ballistic nuclear submarines, stealthily patrolling under the Arctic ice, and Soviet strategic bombers flying over it. U.S. security interests in the Arctic today are a dim reflection of that bipolar Cold War era. Yet much of the security infrastructure remaining in Alaska, rusted and largely abandoned, was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. In the Arctic, the United States has had trouble updating its strategy. The most definitive declaration of U.S. policy toward the Arctic is a presidential directive, signed by President George W. Bush in January 2009. Following an extensive interagency effort, the directive outlines some of the most pressing U.S. security interests in the region: missile defense and early-warning systems; strategic deterrence and maritime security operations; maintaining freedom of navigation; and preventing terrorist attacks. It also addresses governance of the internationally controlled region, scientific cooperation, environmental issues and economic developments. But the U.S. strategies and policy statements about the Arctic are poor substitutes for action in the Arctic. And that's where the United States falls flat. The Coast Guard has no operating bases or stations above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. That means that any search-and-rescue or maritime deployment in the U.S. Arctic Sea is delayed by at least eight hours by air and days by sea. Today, the United States has only one medium-duty operational icebreaker in commission, the Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The Coast Guard's entire inventory of such vessels includes two heavy icebreakers, Polar Sea and Polar Star, both of which are not operational. The future of this fleet is in Congress's hands, where the House and Senate are wrangling over funding decisions. The security cost of the limited capability of the United States in the Arctic became clear this month. Officials in Nome, Alaska, needed a Russian tanker to deliver an emergency shipment of fuel when the city was blocked by sea ice, shifted by a strong winter storm. To escort the tanker, the Coast Guard ship Healy had to be diverted from a scientific mission. It is scheduled to break an ice channel for the tanker once the Russian vessel is cleared to enter the Alaskan port and will facilitate the tanker's return to open water. This past summer, Sweden decided to recall its icebreaker, which was leased to the U.S. government, leaving the United States unable to reach and resupply its scientific station in the other polar region, the Antarctic. Alaskan Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell (R) recently told Congress that ""without action, America is putting its national security on the line, and we are going to miss the opportunities of the Arctic while watching other nations advance."" Treadwell isn't just being alarmist. Five years ago, Russia fired cruise missiles over the Arctic in a summer military exercise, resumed surface naval patrols in Arctic waters in 2008, reinforced its strategic nuclear forces in the North, and is currently building eight ballistic missile submarines planned to be completed by 2015. Last year, two Russian strategic bombers carried out a routine patrol mission over the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and were shadowed by a large number of NATO jet fighters, the first time in recent memory that such a large NATO response occurred. The 21st-century Arctic will require strong coordination among the Arctic coastal states, other nations in close proximity to the Arctic such as Sweden, Iceland and Finland, and Arctic indigenous populations. That is why those countries created the Arctic Council in 1996 to support international cooperation on environmental protection and sustainable development. However, the council's mandate forbids it to discuss military or security matters. Although four out of the five coastal states are members of NATO, that is the last organization that Russia would like to see enhance its presence in the Arctic. Yet the longer there is an ad-hoc approach to Arctic security, the greater the risk of misunderstandings, miscommunications and accidents in this dark, ice-covered and hostile region. An Inuit proverb suggests that ""only when the ice breaks will you truly know who is your friend and who is your enemy."" The United States will find out who its allies and rivals will be in the Arctic sooner rather than later. Fifty years ago, securing and controlling the Arctic was a national imperative. In the 21st-century Arctic, the challenges are just as relevant and real, although quite different from preventing a Japanese invasion or stopping a Soviet missile. And the United States needs to act before the opportunity, like the ice, melts away. Heather A. Conley is the director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former deputy assistant secretary of state.

"Where the heart will go on; The glory days of the shipyards are long gone, so Titanic Belfast is the future, says Stephen Best",NL,"These days, post-industrial urban waterfronts are not complete without a contemporary museum. Whether it is Bilbao, Manchester, Boston or Shanghai, inner-city docksides once dominated by the hustle and bustle of heavy machinery have become places of recreation. Although by nature these new constructions are concerned with culture, they are also about a city's image, and are often an attempt to redefine it. So Titanic Belfast, a delicately poised 14,000 sq metre glinting metal calyx levitating above the barren emptiness of Harland and Wolff's once-thriving shipyards, has a good deal to do. Few cities are as closely identi-fied with their docks as Belfast. Emerging from the shallow mud-flats of the Lagan estuary in the 19th century, their success drove the city's development and propelled its explosive population growth from 70,000 in 1841 to more than 385,000 in 1911. This period defined the city socially, economically and politically. Opening on March 30, Titanic Belfast is a centenary celebration of the city at its pomp, a time when it boasted the world's biggest shipyard and was constructing the largest, most luxurious boats of the day. These included the three Olympic-class sister ships for the White Star Line — Olympic, Britannic and, of course, Titanic, whose tragic first voyage began on April 2, 1912, when it left Belfast. Today, the mighty shipyards are all but gone. Taking their place is one of the largest innercity mixed-use regeneration schemes in Europe, the planned 185-acre Titanic Quarter. The centrepiece of this master plan is a £97m (€116m) spiky, theatrical six-storey aluminium and glass pavilion, containing a civic museum that aims to be the new face of old Belfast as well as a catalyst for urban renewal. The building comprises an interactive museum, temporary gallery, cafes and shop. Hidden below its four tilted wing-tipped roofs is a two-storey penthouse containing multipurpose function rooms, which can accommodate between 50 and 750 people. It was conceived by CivicArts/ Eric Kuhne & Associates, a London practice best known for its design of Bluewater, a seminal project in Kent often credited with redefining the retail mall as a recreational destination. The role of executive architect was taken by Todd Architects, a local firm who recently completed the award-winning Public Record Office of Northern Ireland. Architectural projects sometimes need to be appraised from the inside out. This one needs to be examined in a wider context, to judge its impact on the city. Located on Queen's Island at the end of slipways No 2 and 3, where the Olympic and Titanic were built, Titanic Belfast is moored in front of the now empty drawing offices where the ships were designed. The building presents itself as a frosted confection diced into four floating silvery shards, embedded in a glassy crystalline core. It is a sculptural objet d'art, landed as if from outer space. Yet it feels no more alien than a ship out of water or some of the more exotic constructions recently evident in Harland and Wolff's adjacent yard, such as giant oil rig platforms and wind turbine assemblies. According to the designers, the building's sculptural form takes its cue from the prow of the Titanic under construction. Each of the four wing tips is between 28 and 30 metres high, which is roughly equal to the height of the ship's bow on the slipway, nestled beneath the cathedral-like Arrol Gantry. Yet, despite its scale, the building appears diminutive when set against the vast industrial backdrop that includes the soaring yellow gantries known as Samson and Goliath, which were officially recognised in 2004 as historic monuments of national importance. The twin cranes command the skyline and when seen together with Titanic Belfast form an interesting sociopolitical collage. The building is dominated by four radiating, largely windowless wings that are clad in a rippled husk of more than 3,000 shiny, anodised marine-grade aluminium-angled planks, which form a fractured, shimmering skin. Contained within them are nine themed galleries. Each one is a self-contained stage set designed to celebrate the local workforce that established Belfast's reputation for industrial prowess when making the Titanic. The building is set back 60 metres from the water's edge and takes its geometry from the parallel slipways, offset at an acute angle from the river Lagan. Four full-height vertical slots define the ground-floor entrances; each one is cut through the crisp outer skin to reveal a chocolaty interior of dark, treated horizontal oak louvres. Inside, the building's organisation is a surprise. Instead of the expected cruciform arrangement expressed in the external form, there is a long, linear atrium between the north and south entrances, which align with the slipways. This is a soaring fourstorey volume that has a black painted ceiling and is lined on one side with lacquered prerusted weathering steel panels, to mimic a ship's hull. The atrium, which is a mesh of exposed black-painted steel structure, is populated with caged glass elevators, as well as flying black-clad stairs and escalators, which provide vertical circulation. It is a scene reminiscent of a ship's bowel or one of Giovanni Piranesi's powerful yet haunting Carceri etchings. Above the ground-floor cafes and shops, the museum galleries form a spiralling self-contained route around the central volume, which begins and ends at the first-floor level. The nine interactive multimedia galleries transport you, Tardislike, back 100 years to the making of the Titanic. Each describes one of the stages of its construction, launch and final resting place, 600 miles south of Mistaken Point in Newfoundland. The exhibition concludes with live links from the current exploration vessels of Robert Ballard, who found the wreck in 1985. On the second floor, sandwiched between the permanent exhibitions, is an education centre and temporary gallery for travelling events. Up the main escalator, billed as the longest in Ireland, is the Titanic suite, a collection of multipurpose doubleheight function rooms, which can accommodate up to 750 people. Each room is bedecked with contemporary recreations from the Titanic's interior, including an adaptation of the ship's main oak staircase. A landing was added to comply with building regulations. Outside at ground level, the building is surrounded by a sea of light and dark granite pavers, which are arranged in a map of the northern hemisphere, including an arc of Titanic's journey across the Atlantic. However the billiard-table flatness of the site means this landscape narrative is difficult to read. Belfast is no longer known as a great shipbuilder or a place of trouble and the city is using Titanic Belfast as an opportunity, albeit one provided by industrial decline, to build anew. It seeks to capture the Bilbao effect that extraordinary architecture promises, to transform itself into a tourist destination by announcing its new-found confidence loud and clear. Will Titanic Belfast work as well when it is engulfed by the remainder of the unbuilt master plan? From the drawings and models in the on-site development office, it appears much of the visual articulation the building currently provides will be lost, as prime waterfront sites are taken over by taller, more commercial elements. It should also be remembered that the legacy of our built heritage is not created by individual works of genius but through a harmonised collective. At its best, urban design is carefully choreographed so that each architect follows another's lead. It is what makes good design the stuff of legend, like the Titanic itself. cThe city is seeking to announce its new-found confidence loud and clear"
"Old Harry has gulf whipped into a tempest; Untapped oil, gas",NL,"Rarely has a stretch of seabed caused as much controversy as Old Harry. The 30 km-long site in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is perhaps the biggest untapped offshore oil-and-gas play in Eastern Canada, harnessing estimated resources of 2 billion barrels of oil and as much as 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It is also the epicentre of a monster battle for the future of the fish-rich waterway. Environmentalists, fishermen and those who make their living from tourism in the region's pristine landscape are squaring off against energy promoters and those who argue development can be done safely. Quebec and Newfoundland are also duelling over the boundary of the prospect as millions of dollars of royalties hang in the balance. Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore regulator was swamped when it invited public submissions last March on a plan by junior resource company Corridor Resources Inc. to drill the site. The commentary was greater than anything the regulator had received in its 26-year existence, it said. Looming over the project is the blowout and aftermath of BP PLC's well in the Gulf of Mexico, the biggest in U.S. history. Concern is palpable in Atlantic Canada that a similar accident can happen there. A big portion of the criticism has come from other provinces, fearful of seeing their fisheries ruined by a spill at the site while sharing none of the revenues. Old Harry became so contentious that the regulator asked the federal government to decide whether to open the gulf to drilling. Federal Environment Minister Peter Kent declined the request, instructing regulator chief executive Max Ruelokke instead to update an environmental assessment of the western Newfoundland offshore area with thorough public consultations and also continue and complete a separate screening of the specific project. Quebec is doing its own environmental review, which it says will be ready by the end of the year. Based on information available to date, neither the regulator nor other federal departments involved have identified evidence indicating the project is likely to cause ""significant adverse environmental effects,"" Mr. Ruelokke has said. That doesn't satisfy opponents of the project. Hollywood actor Ethan Hawke is one high-profile critic against development. He built a three-bedroom retreat on an undisclosed island in the area several years ago with his former wife, Uma Thurman. He argues the entire wilderness is under threat from offshore drilling plans. ""At every turn, when humanity is asked the question, 'Do you want temporary economic gain or long-term environmental loss ... we invariably choose the money,"" Mr. Hawke told Canadian Press in November. ""It's totally understandable. But I feel like we're reaching, as a community, some kind of crisis point."" Others frame the issue in a different way. There's been little public experience with offshore drilling in Eastern Canada and a lack of familiarity dealing with the oil-and-gas industry in the eastern provinces in general, commentators have noted. The result: A huge backlash against shale-gas exploration in Quebec. Skepticism of offshore development in the St. Lawrence. Politicians scrambling to balance public concern with the need to diversify government revenue sources. And regulatory duplication and uncertainty, much to the exasperation of industry. ""Sure, we're frustrated,"" Corridor chief executive Phil Knoll said in an interview this week. ""Is it worth it? Of course it's worth it.... If there are hydrocarbon resources there, they could be very extensive."" Corridor's previous expectation that it could drill a well at Old Harry by 2013-2014 no longer holds and a new date can't be estimated, Mr. Knoll said. The company has formally requested the screening of the Old Harry project be suspended until the larger environmental assessment of the gulf region is complete, a sort of 'time-out' of its Newfoundland exploration licence. It has been looking at the structure for about 15 years. Based on the technical information Corridor has on Old Harry to date, which includes seismic testing and satellite imagery showing oil seepage, Corridor says there is a reasonable chance there could be a hydrocarbon reserve at the site. The only way to find out is to drill. If Old Harry is commercializeable, there's also the possibility other oil plays in the gulf are as well. ""They don't exist in isolation,"" Mr. Knoll said. He argued that could represent a significant financial windfall for government beyond just one project. Halifax-based Corridor has spent countless work hours and more than $6-million so far on testing and other socalled ""external costs"" on Old Harry. The company, which has a single revenue-producing property, the McCully natural-gas field near Sussex, N.B., is searching for a joint-venture partner to share the costs and ownership of Old Harry. There's been plenty of interest but no takers. nvanpraet@nationalpost.com"
Other provinces have no cause to gloat over Ontario's woes,NL,"OTTAWA -- jibbitson@globeandmail.com Anyone who might take satisfaction in watching Ontario, once the richest province in Canada, get its comeuppance as it grapples with low growth and high debt should remember that the province's troubles are everyone's troubles. In this country, when Ontario suffers, everyone else suffers, too. Many of us remember the waves of public-sector strikes and repeated civil disturbances that accompanied the Mike Harris government's efforts to eliminate a chronic deficit in the 1990s. Economist Don Drummond in his report on Ontario's current situation warns that this time “the government will have to cut program spending more deeply … and over a much longer period of time than the Harris government did.” Things have gotten so bad because over the past decade the province has become two Ontarios. The first Ontario is Toronto, a Canadian New York whose economy is powered by financial services, education, biosciences, cultural industries, tourism and more. Living in or near Toronto, it can feel as though things are still going reasonably well. But outside Greater Toronto is a whole lot of Ohio, as the manufacturing sector follows other Great Lakes economies into rustbelt status. This is why unemployment has been above the national average for five years, and why the last recession was far worse in Ontario than elsewhere. It is why, amazingly, average personal income has dropped below the national average. And it is why real growth of about 2 per cent annually is the most the province can expect for years to come. Yet Ontario continues to finance the social programs that many provinces depend on. Its taxpayers contribute 39 per cent of federal revenues, but receive only 34 per cent of federal spending. Each year, 2 per cent of the province's GDP, or $12.3-billion, bleeds to the rest of the country, even as Queen's Park records a deficit of $14-billion, which Mr. Drummond calls “a clear demonstration of the perverse structure of Canadian fiscal federalism.” Ontario voters can no longer afford to finance Employment Insurance programs that favour Atlantic fishermen over laid-off auto workers. No Ontario government can tolerate equalization programs that subsidize university tuition outside the province, even as Mr. Drummond calls for annual increases to postsecondary education of no more than 1.5 per cent, less than the rate of inflation. Voters in the Prairie and Pacific provinces may shrug and say this is an Eastern problem for the Eastern provinces to sort out. This attitude is delusional. Even the most resource-rich provinces and Ottawa, as well, face lean years as they try to balance their books. “People shouldn't have any illusions,” said Craig Alexander, Mr. Drummond's successor as chief economist of the Toronto Dominion Bank. “Keeping program spending to around the pace of inflation or below is extraordinarily difficult. “If governments actually managed to do what they have committed to do up to this point, it would be one of the longest and most painful periods of fiscal austerity the country has ever had.” And this time the economic engine in the heartland won't be there to cushion the pain and take up the slack. The Drummond report won't be fully implemented. At best, the McGuinty government is likely to slow the growth of the debt. It lacks the mandate, and probably the political will, to slash spending as severely as needed to balance the budget. This will leave the province dangerously vulnerable to another recession, an oil shock or a sharp rise in interest rates, which could swiftly bring on a fiscal emergency. Alberta defaulted on its debt during the Depression. In more recent times, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland came close. If any province found itself unable to service its debt, “we explicitly assume that there is a high probability that the federal government would help the province,” said Jennifer Wong, assistant vice-president at Moody's Investors Service, in an interview. If things go badly, Ontario's problem could become everyone's problem, with a vengeance."
Today in History - March 8,NL,"Today is March 8: On this date, In 1698, the first meeting convened of the British group which later formed the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or SPCK Today, SPCK equips Christians throughout the world with financial grants, resources, advice and encouragement.

In 1867, the British parliament passed the British North America Act. Many MPs were not in the Chamber for final reading, but they rushed in immediately after to vote on a bill to place a tax on dogs. The act received royal assent on March 29 and Queen Victoria set July 1 as the date for Confederation. On this date 115 years later, in 1982, the British Commons passed the Canada Bill for patriation of the Constitution. In 1873, the Northwest Territories council prohibited the sale of liquor. In 1889, John Ericsson, who invented the first successful screw propeller, died. In 1894, New York dog owners became the first in the U.S. to license their pets.

In 1915, about 10,000 people marched on the Ontario legislature to present a huge petition -- 825,572 signatures -- demanding Prohibition. In 1917, riots and strikes in St. Petersburg marked the beginning of the Russian Revolution. In 1939, Sir Henry Pellatt, the millionaire who built Casa Loma in Toronto, died. He was 80 years old. Pellatt had the castle built between 1911-14 at a cost of $2 million. Based on European designs, it had about 50 rooms and was lavishly decorated. Pellatt suffered financial losses in the 1930's and lost Casa Loma, which is now a tourist attraction.

In 2008, Serbia's prime minister dissolved the government and called for new elections after clashing with his pro-Western coalition partners over Kosovo and European Union membership. In 2008, Donald C. MacDonald, former leader of the CCF and the New Democratic Parties in Ontario, died in Toronto at age 94. Often called the best premier that Ontario never had, he represented the Ontario provincial riding of York South for the CCF for nearly 30 years, from 1955-82. In 2008, Quebec Liberals voted 97.2 per cent to back Premier Jean Charest as their leader. It was the highest level of support ever recorded by a party leader in Quebec. In 2009, Trooper Marc Diab, 22, from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, died and three other soldiers were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near their armoured vehicle on patrol northeast of Kandahar city in Afghanistan. In 2009, General Motors of Canada Ltd. and the Canadian Auto Workers union struck a crucial cost-cutting deal that would freeze wages and pensions, increase personal expenses for health care benefits, reduce employee holidays and eliminate annual bonuses. The cuts were critical for the company's survival plan and to qualify for loans from the federal and provincial governments. Members of the CAW voted overwhelmingly in favour of the deal. In 2010, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Vu Pham, 37, was shot and killed after pulling over a pickup truck near London. The suspect, Fred Preston, then became involved in a shootout with two other OPP officers and was critically wounded and died in hospital on March 11."
Why the east need not despair; An aging population and EI reform do not eclipse the promise of new opportunities,NL,"jibbitson@globeandmail.com When Statistics Canada reveals the latest data on the country's aging population, Atlantic Canadians might be tempted to hang their heads in defeat. They shouldn't. There is a positive future for the easternmost provinces, a future that could prove the naysayers wrong. A generation from now, people could be going up the road instead of down it. Tuesday's census could be the last one to show Atlantic Canada in decline, if Atlantic Canadians choose to make it so. Along with almost every other developed nation, Canadian society is aging, with the first of the baby boomers heading into retirement, leaving an ever-shrinking cohort of workers to support the state through taxes. The good news for most parts of Canada is that our robust immigration levels and welcoming attitude toward both temporary and permanent foreign workers will mitigate the effects of a greying society. But little of this is any comfort to Atlantic Canadians. The chronically weak economy not only encourages the young to migrate west, it deters immigrants. A region lacking young people or immigrants lacks creativity, entrepreneurship, dynamism. And the Maritime provinces, notwithstanding business powerhouses like the McCains, Sobeys and Irvings, remain too rural, too small and too dependent. The Harper government is determined to equip the Canadian economy to handle its aging population, which is why it is raising the retirement age for social security and why it announced new restrictions on employment insurance last week, aimed at forcing seasonal workers in fishing, forestry, agriculture and tourism to take other work during the offseason or lose their benefits. Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter observed that seasonal work is integral to the region's rural culture. “If they see that as a problem, then they essentially see the culture of rural Canada as a problem,” he said. But the plain fact is that with the population aging and economic growth expected to remain sluggish for years to come, Canada just can't afford rural subsidies. Rural industries must be able and willing to pay their own way. That doesn't mean Atlantic Canada needs to despair. In fact, there may never have been such reason for optimism. Newfoundland and Labrador is booming as never before. It's not just oil. It's hydroelectricity and nickel and other natural resources. It's the high-tech firms spinning off from these booming natural-resource industries. No wonder St. John's has a lower unemployment rate than Toronto. The shipbuilding contracts from the federal government will generate billions in revenue for Halifax Shipyards, and billions more in spinoff industries, creating thousands of skilled jobs. The region's top-notch universities will ensure there are workers to fill those jobs. Provincial governments have started to get serious about encouraging immigration. This is crucial to reversing population decline and to generating economic growth. And though you'll never find a politician who wants to get re-elected who'll admit it, the employment-insurance reforms are good for the region. Rural industries that lack the capital and incentive to provide year-round employment drain more in government support than they generate in revenue. They keep workers where they shouldn't be, instead of encouraging them to move to where the good jobs are. In a recent forum, Yvon Godin, a New Brunswick NDP MP, angrily asked how urbanites expect to eat fish if there aren't seasonal workers to catch and process those fish. But market forces would ensure that Torontonians received their lobster in a way that, properly regulated, would be better both for the fishery and for the Maritime economy. Atlantic Canadians have a golden opportunity to exploit the region's natural and human resources. They need only ignore the old, closed, fearful voices that promote dependency and cause decline. There's a future for region; all it has to do is seize it. Because the numbers that will be revealed in the census will leave them little choice."
Today in History - July 2,NL,"Today is July 2: Also on this date: In 311, Miltiades was elected the 32nd pope of the Catholic Church. During his pontificate, Christianity was finally tolerated by Rome, following the Emperor Constantine's conversion to the Christian faith. In 1489, Thomas Cranmer, the first Protestant Archbishop of Canterbury, was born. He was the primary author of the ``Book of Common Prayer'' and ``Thirty-Nine Articles of the Anglican Church.'' In 1566, the French astrologer Nostradamus, died. In 1578, Martin Frobisher discovered the Hudson Strait. In 1808, explorer Simon Fraser reached the Pacific Ocean near what is now Vancouver. Fraser thought he had been on the Columbia River, but was actually on the river that now bears his name. In 1821, Sir Charles Tupper, Canada's sixth prime minister, was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He led the federal government for a few months in 1896. Tupper, who was also the first president of the Canadian Medical Association, died in 1915. In 1865, William Booth formed the Salvation Army at a meeting in London. Booth, a successful revivalist preacher, was originally in the Methodist church but had resigned because it would not let him preach. His speech at a mission in Whitechapel is considered by the Salvation Army as the date of its formation. The Army spread to Canada in 1882. In 1881, James Garfield, 20th president of the United States, was shot. He died from his wound three months later. It was just four months after his inauguration that he was shot at the Washington, D.C., railway station by Charles Guiteau, an erratic lawyer and disappointed office-seeker. In 1885, the Plains Cree Chief Big Bear surrendered at Fort Carlton, Sask. In 1900, the first rigid zeppelin airship, created by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, took flight near Lake Constance in Germany. It carried five people, reached an altitude of 396 metres and flew a distance of six kilometres in 17 minutes. In 1900, stage director and playwright Tyrone Guthrie was born in Tunbridge Wells, England. Guthrie was the founding artistic director of the Shakespearean Festival in Stratford, Ontario. He died in 1971. In 1912, five people died when the dirigible ``Alcron'' exploded over Atlantic City. In 1924, Edmonton's temperature reached 36.7 degrees Celsius, the highest in more than 100 years. In 1926, Arthur Meighen's Conservative government lost a Commons non-confidence motion by one vote. Meighen became prime minister three days earlier when MacKenzie King resigned over Governor General Lord Byng's refusal to call an election. After Meighen's defeat, Byng agreed to a Sept. 14 election, which King's Liberals won. In 1931, Peter Kurten, dubbed ``The Monster of Dusseldorf,'' died by guillotine in France for raping and killing eight women and children in a 10-month period. In 1937, American aviator Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the Pacific while attempting to circle the globe. After taking off from New Guinea and reporting by radio that they were lost and running out of fuel, the pair did not reach their destination of Howland Island and were never heard from again. In 1940, a German U-boat torpedoed the liner ``Arandora Star'' while transporting German and Italian prisoners to Canada during the Second World War. Over 750 prisoners and crew died. In 1941, the Royal Canadian Air Force was authorized to enlist women. The Canadian army and navy soon followed suit. In 1941, New York Yankees outfielder Joe DiMaggio set a major league record by hitting safely in his 45th consecutive game. DiMaggio's streak ended at 56 games on July 17. In 1961, American author Ernest Hemingway, plagued by ill health, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Idaho. He was 62. In 1962, volunteer doctors provided emergency services in Saskatchewan when most of its estimated 700 doctors went on strike to protest the province's compulsory medical plan, which went into effect the previous day. In 1968, legislation allowing for easier access to divorce in Canada went into effect. The new ``Divorce Act'' authorized the granting of divorce solely on the grounds of marriage breakdown. In 1969, the first college of veterinary medicine in Western Canada opened at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1974, Ralph Steinhauer became the first aboriginal (he was a Cree) Lieutenant-Governor in Canada, for the province of Alberta. In 1976, North and South Vietnam were officially united after 20 years of war. In 1982, using a lawn chair hoisted by 42 helium-filled weather balloons, Larry Walters took off from San Pedro, Calif. He rose to an altitude of nearly 4,900 metres and travelled 24 kilometres before landing safely in Long Beach. Aviation officials fined him $1,500. In 1984, Karl Saucek, a 37-year-old stuntman from Hamilton, survived a plunge over Niagara Falls in a lightweight metal-and-plastic barrel. In 1990, more than 1,400 Muslim pilgrims died in a stampede inside a pedestrian tunnel leading to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. In 1992, the federal government closed Newfoundland's northern cod fishery for two years to protect dwindling stocks and allow it time to recover. The moratorium, which was later extended, affected more than 19,000 fishermen and plant workers. In 1994, gunmen killed Colombian soccer player Andres Escobar, who accidentally scored a goal against his own team in the World Cup, in Medellin, Colombia. In 1997, Mr. Justice Gilles Letourneau released his Somalia public inquiry report that denounced the highest levels of Canada's military leadership. It said military leaders tried to cover up the death of a civilian in March of 1993, lied to the commission and may have broken the law to hide the truth about the Somalia affair. In 1997, screen legend Jimmy Stewart -- star of such movies as ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and ``The Philadelphia Story'' -- died at his California home at 89. In 1998, officials in Paris re-lit the eternal flame under the Arc de Triomphe. The flame, commemorating France's war dead, was extinguished the previous day by two drunken Mexican tourists who used it as a urinal. In 1999, Mario Puzo, the best-selling author who won two Academy Awards in the 1970s for screen adaptations of his novel ``The Godfather,'' died at age 78. In 2000, 24-year-old Mary Beth Miller, one of Canada's top 10 female biathletes, was mauled to death by a bear while running on a training path near Quebec City. In 2000, in a stunning election upset, Mexico's Opposition leader Vicente Fox was elected president, ending the 71-year reign of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. In 2001, Robert Tools became the first person to receive a fully self-contained artificial heart when doctors implanted the device in Louisville, Ky. Tools, who was 59, lived with the device whirring in his chest for 151 days. In 2002, American multi-millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett became the first to circle the world solo in a balloon, travelling more than 31,000 kilometres. He started June 19 from Northam, Western Australia and landed in the Outback, 1,400 kilometres northwest of Sydney. In 2003, a provincial royal commission report said that the federal government must work with Newfoundland and Labrador to improve the state of the fisheries and ensure more benefits from offshore oil and gas. The report focused on the devastation of a once-lucrative fishery, the out-migration of 70,000 people in the previous decade and double-digit unemployment in each of the last 30 years. It concluded that Newfoundlanders were not interested in separation, but wanted to see a more effective working relationship with Canada. In 2003, Vancouver won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics ahead of Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea. In 2003, the second outbreak of SARS in Toronto was declared over by the World Health Organization. In 2010, an explosion tore through a Canadian Forces recruitment centre in Trois-Rivieres, Que., in the early morning. There were no injuries. ``Resistance internationaliste'' claimed responsibility. In 2010, an F3 tornado destroyed more than a dozen homes in Raymore, Sask., and on the Kawacatoose First Nation. No one died. Environment Canada said the twister was about 500 metres wide, cut a path 45 kilometres long and may have been on the ground for as long as one hour. In 2010, a tanker truck hauling fuel on a rural eastern Congo highway overturned and exploded in a massive fireball that killed at least 242 people. Many of the dead were villagers who had descended on the truck to siphon fuel illegally from the wreckage."
Canada stocks up despite lack of summit progress,NL,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Toronto’s benchmark equities index made up for the session’s earlier losses to finish higher Thursday, as opposed to bearish trading in Wall Street and across the Atlantic as a summit of European Union leaders convened. Still, the S&P;/TSX Composite Index ($ISPTX, CA) saw just modest gains, tacking on 13.76 points to settle at 11,424.7. ”News about elevated trading losses at large US financial institutions as well as expectations that the EU summit today and tomorrow won’t yield much progress,” said CIBC economist Emanuella Enenajor. “Markets recognize the need for fundamental solutions to the Eurozone’s economic and fiscal challenges, and an unfruitful summit would delay taking aggressive steps yet again,” added Enenajor. Read more on the EU summit. In New York the markets didn’t fare as well, as the S&P; 500 (SPX, US) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA, US) settled lower amid fears that little will be accomplished out of the summit. Also pressuring markets were “the results from the Supreme Court on Obamacare, which is bad for companies since health care costs will remain high,” said Brian Huen, managing partner at Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. Despite benchmark gains, a 1.5% drop seen in the materials sector (TTMT, XX) and a 0.89% loss for metals and mining stocks (TTMN, XX) weighed down the market. On the upside, Malaysian state-owned oil and gas company Petronas announced a deal to buy Canada’s Progress Energy Resources (PRG, CA), sending shares of Progress soaring 73.59%. Read more on the Petronas, Progress Energy Resources deal. “The TSX is faring better than the U.S. markets today mainly on the takeout... This is resulting in a number of other gas companies in Canada trading up on the day,” said Huen. Meanwhile gold stocks struggled, led by Centerra Gold Corp. (CG, CA), whose shares tumbled 31.98% following news on the resignation of attorney Niyazbek Aldashev from its board of directors. It marked the latest turn regarding the company’s Kumtor mining venture in Kyrgyzstan. Gold for August delivery (GCQ2, US) finished at its lowest since May, slipping 1.8% to trade at $1,550.40 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Other market movers Thursday were Candax Energy (CAX, CA), trading down 11.11% at close, and SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ, CA), down 8.41% on the day. Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM, CA) reported after close that it swung to a loss of $518 million, or 99 cents a share, down from profits of $695 million, or $1.33 a share, a year ago. The company also said the launch of its BlackBerry 10 mobile operating system will be pushed back to early 2013. In economic news, April’s average weekly earnings for nonfarm-payroll employees rose 1% from March, according to Statistics Canada. Compared with levels a year ago April, earnings have climbed 3.1%. Increases were seen most significantly in the Newfoundland and Labrador province, where earnings rose 6.5%. Further optimism came with reports from Statistics Canada that tourism spending rose 0.9% during the first quarter, marking the 11th-straight quarter of an advancing growth rate. The month’s GDP reading is set to be released Friday. In currency trading Thursday, the Canadian dollar fell 0.83% against its U.S. counterpart (USDCAD, US), with one U.S. dollar buying C$1.0333. “The correlation between oil and USD/CAD has peaked. This correlation drops when oil is below [$100], as Canada’s oil sands reserves become uncompetitive, and the focus will shift instead to Canada’s healthy finances and safe-haven qualities,” wrote Sebastien Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe Generale, in a note Thursday."
The Increasing Allure Of Faraway Fairways,NL,"INVERNESS, Nova Scotia -- John MacIsaac was once among nearly 900 workers who descended into the coal mines at the edge of this isolated seaside town, plunging 2,500 feet beneath the ocean floor to labor in a labyrinth of dark tunnels. ''When I would come back up, occasionally there would be a tourist wanting a picture of this person so covered in black coal dust, only the whites of my eyes showed,'' MacIsaac said. ''Now when I go back to that very same spot, people are taking my picture next to a brand-new, picturesque golf course. Who dreams of such a thing?'' The golf industry worldwide is asking the same thing. The course that opened Friday in this remote and economically depressed part of northwestern Nova Scotia is not a little pitch-and-putt for the 1,800 residents who remained after the coal mines shut down. Cabot Links -- one of a handful of new courses opening in North America this year -- is a resort-quality, high-end layout designed to be a true links golf course, a boutique category of oceanside golf architecture exceedingly rare outside the British Isles. But why put it here, several hundred miles and a time zone from any large metropolitan city and a lonesome three-and-a-half-hour drive in a rental car from Nova Scotia's lone major airport? In golf, it seems, remote is the new luxury. ''If familiarity breeds contempt, then nonfamiliarity breeds mystique,'' said Mike Hughes, the chief executive of the National Golf Course Owners Association. ''And the more isolated you become, the more you buy into it. People going that far for golf focus on the golf exclusively and leave their cellphones and e-mails behind. They're also usually playing spectacular golf courses.'' The foremost example of the seclusion-yields-success business model is Bandon Dunes, a similarly inaccessible Oregon seacoast complex opened in 1999 that now draws 130,000 golfers annually and employs almost 1,000. The developer of Bandon Dunes, Mike Keiser, a former greeting card mogul who grew up in upstate New York, is the financial clout behind Cabot Links as well. ''We have seen year after year that oceanside and links is a magical golf formula, and being out of the way has not been a disadvantage,'' Keiser said. ''The trip invests you in the experience.'' There are other popular examples, some not even on the water. The Sand Hills Golf Club in central Nebraska, a links-style course, has built a cultlike following in its 17 years of operation. For the Nova Scotia project, it has helped that the industry's trade magazines have been breathless in their praise awaiting its opening. Links magazine, which is unashamedly persnickety when it comes to appraising the credentials of a true links course, called Cabot Links the only seaside links course between Bandon, Ore., and the famed Ballybunion Golf Club in Ireland. Back in Inverness, some are mildly skeptical that a world of golfers will flock to their course. ''Our people understand the geography better than anyone,'' MacIsaac, 70, said in the lilting, Scottish-influenced accent common here. ''But I say to them: 'You don't understand how crazy golfers can be. You'll see.' '' The idea for a links course in oft-forgotten Inverness goes back decades. Town leaders looked at the pile of slag left behind when the last of the coal mines shuttered in the late 1960s and organized a committee to devise uses for the land that sits between the town and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Not surprisingly, in a province named New Scotland, the top suggestion was a golf course. Many golf developers, including Jack Nicklaus, were interested. But in each case over the years, the financing fell through or the parties lost interest. ''We were devastated with each defeat,'' said Duart MacAuley, the Inverness County warden. A nearby pulp mill that employed 270 also closed. A gypsum mine went out of business. The lobster and crab market was damaged by fluctuating prices. Turning abandoned coal mines into a scenic golf course remained a pipe dream. Then one night in 2004, a top provincial official, Rodney MacDonald -- not everyone in Inverness has a name that begins with Mac but most do -- was in Toronto sitting next to Ben Cowan-Dewar, a golf tourism operator. MacDonald regaled Cowan-Dewar with an account of unwanted golf land in Inverness. Cowan-Dewar, who built a golf hole at his family's Ontario farm when he was 8, made the trek to Inverness on Cape Breton Island. He was smitten by the landscape. ''I knew there wasn't another oceanside golf parcel like it in eastern North America,'' Cowan-Dewar said last Sunday. ''Of course, I didn't really know how to develop a golf course yet.'' Cowan-Dewar, then just 25, nonetheless started pitching his vision to everyone, beginning with regional agencies that could lend him money. He had to piece together and buy 14 land parcels from various owners. And in March 2008, even though not one golf hole had been constructed, he moved from downtown Toronto to Inverness with his wife, Allie Barclay, who was 35 weeks pregnant and leaving behind a career in finance. ''I arrived in tears,'' Barclay said last week, recalling the move. ''I felt like I was in the witness protection program.'' Four years later, Barclay runs the Cabot Links pro shop and helps with administrative duties, and has a 4-year-old son, a 2-year-old daughter and a charming house that overlooks the golf course and ocean. ''I didn't know how welcoming everyone would be,'' she said, sitting in the Red Shoe Pub not far from the course. As fiddle music filled the pub and every foot tapped to the beat of a Celtic reel, Barclay smiled as she nodded or waved at seemingly everyone. That included the two waitresses, the man collecting the cover charge and a half-dozen patrons who are among the 125 employees at Cabot Links. ''You create 125 jobs in Chicago, and it means nothing,'' Cowan-Dewar said. ''You do it in a community this size, and it affects a lot of families very directly.'' For about one in three Inverness households since the 1970s, regular employment has meant a long trip to western Canada to work in the oil industry. Men and women go for two- or three-week shifts. ''I wasn't sure I'd ever get out of Alberta,'' said Jessica MacDonald, 24, who worked there the last four years. ''But when the golf course started hiring, I couldn't wait to come home.'' The Cabot Links work force includes teenagers, college students, young professionals and local retirees. The course, which has no golf carts, fields a full caddie corps, offering the perk of access to the course in off hours. Town residents have grown used to seeing children walking down the streets with golf clubs, not just hockey sticks. Cabot Links, shaped and designed by the noted Canadian golf architect Rod Whitman, will not be cheap for them, with peak-hour greens fees of about 110 Canadian dollars, or $108. There is a $70 twilight rate for Cape Breton residents. Most top-100 golf courses in North America, a grouping Cabot Links will probably soon be compared to, usually charge far more. Many charge twice as much. Still, the cost to play at Cabot Links, or to stay in one of the 48 hotel rooms with floor-to-ceiling glass walls overlooking the golf course (nightly rates begin at $225), has raised some eyebrows in Inverness. There are minor concerns about protecting the adjacent public beaches. Housing and property prices in town have skyrocketed. Lawrence MacIsaac, a retired military chaplain who recently returned to Inverness, his hometown, and became a real estate agent, said that one of the many old matching homes built for coal mine workers -- called Red Rows because they were all painted red and tightly spaced -- is listed for $250,000. Ten years ago, such homes sold for $40,000. ''So, yes, there are some people wondering about how the town will change,'' Lawrence MacIsaac, John's cousin, said as he ate breakfast in the Coal Miner's Cafe. ''But the vast majority of us recall when there were six or eight boarded-up businesses in town and a sense of hopelessness. You can say it's only a golf course, but it's put a bounce in our step.'' As evidence, he pointed to the national chain Robin's Donuts, which is opening a franchise on Central Avenue -- with Inverness's first drive-through window. The course developers say they will expand Cabot Links if it draws about 20,000 golfers annually. That is a reasonable expectation because western Nova Scotia is the more temperate side of the island, with a golf season that can run from mid-April to mid-November. Additional oceanfront property has been acquired for another 18 holes. Then there will be two new upscale golf courses so far from, well, everything. ''It's not Newfoundland or the North Pole,'' Keiser said. ''It's east of Maine, not north of it. Bandon Dunes is far more remote.'' As for John MacIsaac, who climbed out of the mines as a young man to become a teacher, principal and assistant superintendent of schools in Inverness, he is brimming with the expectation of someone about to host a gigantic, long-awaited party. ''It's been our dream for decades to create something that's green, open and full of the outdoors,'' he said last week, standing beside the 18th hole and waving a hand at the golf landscape that reaches to the sea. ''I hope so many people come that the place is always busy and I never get to play. ''I'll go down to the beach and take pictures of them.''"
Left out in the cold?; Canada a laggard in global race for Arctic resources,NL,"The five hotels of the Northwest Territories town of Norman Wells (population: 800) saw more than their fair share of hard hats last year. ""You could not get a room there for six months last winter,"" said David Ramsay, Northwest Territories' minister of transportation industry, tourism and investment. ""Grocery stores saw a 100% increase in sales; it was unprecedented economic activity for that period of time - we are going to see even more this coming winter."" Norman Wells is not alone in witnessing this bonanza. Towns and communities across the vast Arctic landscape are waking up to the riches that lie buried beneath, as oil executives scope for prospects and Arctic governments take another 'strategic' look at the region's hydrocarbon and mineral riches. The area shared by Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States offers an estimated 46 trillion cubic metres of undiscovered global natural gas, or 30% of the global total. In addition, it holds 90 billion barrels of oil - or 13% of the estimated global total of undiscovered oil, according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey. While the Arctic's resource potential has been known for decades, the North Pole has historically presented a daunting logistical challenge. Until now. In what may be described as an environmentalist's worst nightmare, global warming and melting ice in the Arctic are rewarding oil companies with access to its thawing oil, gas and mineral deposits through greater shipping access. But that's just part of the equation. ""Climate change has reduced the barrier to entry - it is definitely an enabling factor,"" says Charles Emmerson, who wrote The Future History of the Arctic and is a senior research fellow at London-based Chatham House. He believes the entire Arctic area could see investments of more than $100-billion over the next decade, primarily in oil and gas, mining and shipping. ""Other key drivers include improved technology. Secondly, the cost of producing the fields may be less than before, and more importantly, the price for oil is right - not so much for gas."" Big Oil is also running out of places to drill. With stateowned enterprises shutting off oil majors in much of the Middle East and Latin America, the Arctic presents itself as a meltingly tempting prospect. But Canada may have to wait a little while longer, as oil majors focus on other opportunities. Moscow, Oslo and Washington already have Arctic projects underway and have drawn up far more advanced plans to exploit the region, potentially leaving Ottawa behind in the global (sled) race for Arctic resources. ""When I look at Canadian Arctic energy exploration, I see a litany of missed opportunities in the past,"" says Mr. Emmerson, who argues that mineral mining offers a better medium-term prospect in the Canadian North than hydrocarbons. ""But that's not necessarily such a bad thing. There are all kinds of environmental consequences of drilling for oil and gas. Canadian Arctic is one of the most remote parts of the Arctic. So if something were to go wrong, it would be incredibly hard to deal with."" Of course, Ottawa already has enough energy environmental concerns to deal with in the Alberta oil sands, and may not have the political appetite to take on environmentalists who are ramping up their global campaign against Arctic development. Which puts N.W.T. and Nunavut in a bind as the federal government controls sale of land and resources in the two Arctic territories. The premiers of the Yukon, N.W.T. and Nunavut met this month and pushed for greater say in the country energy's policy and on the intergovernmental Arctic Council - an association of coastal states and other interested parties that periodically discuss security, environment emergency response and development. Mr. Ramsay hopes the N.W.T. government will wrap up devolution negotations with Ottawa by 2014 and fasttrack its energy plans. By that time natural gas prices may have rebounded from their decade low, making N.W.T.'s centrepiece $16billion Mackenzie Gas Project feasible. The pipeline, which was stuck in Canada's regulatory quagmire for nine years, has now been shelved due to poor economic feasibility. The Mackenzie Gas project is not the only one up N.W.T.'s sleeves, with a total of 81 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 7 billion barrels of oil ""waiting to be taken,"" according to the minister. Husky Energy Inc. is building a 36-kilometre all-weather road between Norman Wells and Tulita, while Chevron Corp. is planning seismic exploration in the area this year. The government also recently sold two parcels north of Norman Wells, generating $92million in work commitment. Overall, the industry has committed close to $630-million of exploration over the next four to five years. But for now, the gas remains buried. With lower Canada and the United States awash in oil and shale gas, the idea of laying a gas pipeline through some of the underdeveloped Arctic plains may not be appealing, especially at $2 per British thermal unit of gas. Nunavut, which is estimated to hold a quarter of Canada's conventional oil reserves, is much further behind the N.W.T. in its devolution discussions with Ottawa. But negotiations have finally begun, said Peter Taptuna, Nunavut's minister of economic development and transportation, who has noted rising interest in lands along the southern reaches of the Sverdrup Basin, estimated to hold 500 million barrels of oil and 27 tcf of gas. ""In the next few years we may see renewed exploration occurring there,"" Mr. Taptuna said. Promising exploratory drilling in West Greenland waters has also led to considerable interest in the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. The federal government has begun research and the area could see a 'call for nominations' within a few years, Mr. Taptuna says. In the eastern Arctic, offshore of Baffin Island, estimates place the oil potential in the range of 10 billion to 30 billion barrels. Farther south, toward the Labrador Sea, there is an estimated two tcf to four tcf of gas reserves. Most of it may not see the light of the long Arctic days anytime soon.

"Canada's Highway arrives at a milestone; The 8,000-kilometre-long Trans-Canada Highway was opened 50 years ago by John Diefenbaker",NL,"Stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, Canada's national autoroute is about to hit the Big 5-0. At just over 8,000 kilometres, the Trans-Canada Highway is a sightseeing marvel linking Newfoundland to British Columbia, with thousands of communities and points of interest along the way as it traverses maritime, rural, urban, forest, prairie and mountainous terrain. Ferry services tie the highway to the mainland on both coasts, from St. John's on the Rock in the east to Victoria on Vancouver Island in the west. And while Prince Edward Island is connected by the 13-kilometre Confederation Bridge, a ferry connects Prince Rupert in B.C.'s Queen Charlotte Islands. Set in motion by the Trans-Canada Highway Act of 1949, an agreement between the federal government and the provinces to build a national highway on a cost-shared basis, construction began the following year. Marked by its distinctive white-on-green maple leaf signs, the route was officially opened by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker on Sept. 3, 1962 and was completed in 1971. The Trans-Canada is actually made up of numerous routes in a patchwork of roads crossing the country. Since its completion, some provinces have constructed additional links and added their own upgrades. Although the federal government looks after maintenance and repair of the highway in national parks, it is the responsibility of the provinces to look after it within their borders. In some cases, Ottawa provides funding for upgrades. There are countless points of interest, sights to see and things to do along the Trans-Canada Highway. Here are just 10, one for each province: Terra Nova National Park: About 200 km west of St. John's and 60 km east of Gander, Terra Nova became Newfoundland's first national park when it was established in 1957, eight years after the province joined Confederation. The Trans-Canada runs about 40 km through the middle of the park in a landscape of rugged cliffs and sheltered inlets with rocky fingers reaching out into Bonavista Bay on the North Atlantic Ocean. The boreal forested rolling hills, bogs and ponds support a wide range of wildlife such as moose, bear, beaver and bald eagles. The area's history includes settlements dating back to the earliest European pioneers and native cultures. Icebergs float offshore from May to August and nearly 60 km of trails provide excellent hiking and biking routes. It has campgrounds, places to pull off the road and day-use areas for auto travellers in need of a scenic stretch. Bras d'Or Lake: This inland sea in the centre of Cape Breton, with its hundreds of coves and islands, is an international boat cruising destination. It's where the highlands meet the lowlands and early Scottish settlers found a new world akin to their homeland. The 142-km section of the Trans-Canada running from North Sydney to Port Hastings was named the Mabel and Alexander Graham Bell Way in 2010. Midway along the north shore is the town of Baddeck, where the inventor of the telephone had a summer home. Get off the main highway at Bras d'Or, on the northeastern part of the lake, or at Whycocomagh to the south, and meander along the Bras d'Or Lakes Scenic Drive. Shoreline roads pass through a panorama of farms, villages and woodlands that are home to white-tailed deer, osprey, bald eagles, foxes, and raccoons. Confederation Bridge: The link to Prince Edward Island is an engineering marvel and the reason more tourists visit Canada's birthplace these days. Before its completion in 1997, ferry boats were the only option. But now the crossing is easier and faster - it takes about 10 minutes. Built over four years at a cost of $1.3 billion, the two-lane toll bridge carries the Trans-Canada Highway between Borden-Carleton, P.E.I. and Cape Jourimain, N.B. It is supported by 62 piers in a span that allows major ship traffic to pass underneath. On the island, enjoy the shores of Malpeque Bay, the pretty seaside town of Summerside, the North Cape peninsula, the island's pastoral countryside, the narrow roads linking quaint coastal villages and, of course, Canada's birthplace in Charlottetown. Saint John River: The Trans-Canada follows the river as it flows south through New Brunswick to the Bay of Fundy, a 673-km route from Little Saint John Lake on the Maine-Quebec border. This region includes the Saint John River Valley, home of the ""french fry capital of the world"" in the farming community of Florenceville-Bristol, where the McCain frozen food empire began with a family-owned farm in 1957. A kilometre off the main highway at Hartland (120 km northwest of Fredericton) is the world's longest covered bridge, built in 1901. It is worth the detour and a drive-through. The river's lower section from Fredericton to Saint John is nicknamed the ""Rhine of North America,"" because of its popularity with boaters. St. Lawrence River: The scenery in Quebec is magnifique and the hilltop view from Rivière du Loup, known for its spectacular sunsets, is where it all begins as you head west. Dating back to 1673, it is a stopping point for Trans-Canada travellers coming from Quebec City, the Maritimes or the Gaspé Peninsula. Venture from the highway at any one of several cutoffs onto Route 132 and trek through historic French colonial villages, such as La Poctière, Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, St-Michel-de-Bellechasse or St-Vallier-de-Bellechasse. Charming towns and their surrounding fields rise up gentle slopes dotted with old stone farmhouses. The tall spires of parish churches are the first things that will catch your eye. Lake Superior: The rugged 700-km route along the lake's northern shore is one of Ontario's most beautiful spans of uninterrupted roadway. For the builders of the Trans-Canada, the 265-km stretch from Sault Ste. Marie to Wawa was one of the most difficult sections to complete, second only to the highway over the Rogers Pass in B.C. The vistas from this wonder of the Canadian Shield were two billion years in the making, scoured by the last Ice Age. ""Gitche Gumee"" (Big Water) to the native Ojibwa, it is the largest freshwater lake on the planet. Rocky cliffs and ridges, rolling hills of boreal forest, rushing waterfalls and cobblestone beaches are breathtaking. In fact, they're so beautiful you will have to pull over to savour the scenery that inspired Group of Seven painters in the early 1900s. Terrace Bay, Marathon and Wawa (home of the giant Canada goose) are three of many places you can stop for food and lodging. Portage La Prairie: Winnipeg may be the ""Gateway to the West"" but Portage la Prairie is the ""Fork in the Road"" - the point where the Trans-Canada splits into a northern route along the Yellowhead Highway and a southern route along Hwy. 1. According to Environment Canada, Portage la Prairie has the most sunny days in Canada during the summer months, so chances are the weather will be nice when you visit. Located on the Assiniboine River, the town has a winter lights festival at Christmas and an 18-hole golf course for those sunny days. Quill Lakes: The ""Goose Capital of Saskatchewan"" is a good place to stop for a gander. A designated Shorebird Reserve Network Site, it's where more than 15 species of shorebirds nest spring and summer and is an oasis for long-distance winged migrators. Endangered species such as piping plovers, sage grouse, burrowing owls and whooping cranes swoop by every spring and fall. During the winter, you can see many species of owls and woodpeckers and Arctic transients such as gyrfalcons, snowy owls and flocks of snow buntings. The vast flocks of geese and ducks also make it one of Canada's best bird-hunting regions, drawing hunters from across North America each fall. The village of Quill Lake, established in 1907, is perched above the north end of Big Quill Lake, 160 km east of Saskatoon, and the Yellow-head branch of the Trans-Canada runs around its south shore. Brooks: Take refuge from the near-desert terrain that surrounds this city of 13,000 in the Alberta-Saskatchewan region called ""Palliser's Triangle,"" a largely semi-arid steppe region unsuitable for agriculture. The soil is very nutrient-rich and, although the dryness makes it hard to farm, it's great for ranching. In 1915, settlers built an irrigation aqueduct that was then one of the largest concrete structures in the world, spanning three km and hovering 20 metres above the parched landscape. Now a National Historic Site, the giant centipede-like water channel operated until 1977. Brooks is also an oil and gas hub, with 26,000 wells in the area. South of town, Lake Newell is the focal point for recreation, providing sailing, windsurfing, fishing, hunting and camping. Kinbrook Provincial Park is on the eastern shore of the lake. Rogers Pass: Rising 1,330 metres through the Selkirk Mountains, this stretch of the highway has stunning views that can be dangerously distracting for motorists white-knuckling their way along this rocky roller -coaster route through the B.C. Interior. It is where the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Trans-Canada Highway shortcut through the Big Bend of the Columbia River between the towns of Revelstoke and Golden. Discovered in 1881 by railway surveyor Maj. Albert Rogers, it was the most difficult stretch of the Trans-Canada to build and wasn't paved until 1963. Commemorated as a National Historic Site in the heart of Glacier National Park, it is surrounded by mountains popular for skiing, camping, hiking and mountain climbing. A series of tunnels keep the snow off the roadway from October to May. It has the world's largest mobile avalanche control program. Although snow slides are not a hazard in the summer, driver distraction is. Thankfully, there are many vantage points to pull off and take it in."
What's the PQ's plan for Plan Nord?,NL,"scousineau@globeandmail.com Watching Jean Charest resign after 28 years in politics, Quebeckers were struck when his voice choked with emotion. As premier, no one could recall him being so overwhelmed while speaking of his family. Yet that was not the most poignant moment of his farewell. It was when he pleaded – almost desperately – with premier-designate Pauline Marois to press on with his ambitious plan to harness the province's resources north of the 49th parallel. “The next government must absolutely pursue the Plan Nord's development for the future generation of Quebeckers,” he said. It is remarkable that Mr. Charest, who often appeared aloof as premier, became so passionate about the “construction site of a generation.” What started as a search for a project to win a majority government in the 2008 elections became what he now views as his political legacy. This 25-year plan to access the abundant resources of Quebec's far north was unveiled in May of 2011. But its figures are still dizzying: $80-billion in investments that will create 20,000 jobs a year and bring in $14-billion in the government's coffers. Or so the original plan goes. It now lies in the hands of a skeptical Parti Québécois government, which will unveil its cabinet Wednesday. Everybody expects economist Nicolas Marceau will become the next finance minister. But who will land the Natural Resource portfolio? “Their caucus is rich in ecologists and poor in business people,” lamented Lucien Bouchard, the former PQ premier, who presides over the Petroleum & Gas Association of Quebec. “If they continue to do politics on the back of the Plan Nord to please the radicals, they will kill it. But I am hopeful that when the time comes, their good sense will prevail.” No one believes Ms. Marois wants to sabotage the Plan Nord altogether; she wants to foster Quebec's growth. But as her government seeks to put its own imprint on Quebec's resource policy, it may miss out on the end of the commodities boom. Already, businesses are taking a wait-and-see attitude. One question mark is the use of government funds to build infrastructure that will essentially serve private companies – despite the Liberal Party's claim that Quebeckers would also benefit from it as tourists, who will go outback camping in the North. when they go camping, among other tourist activities. Quebec spent $331-million to build a 243-kilometre road through the Otish mountains to reach the Renard project, which could become the province's first diamond mine. Quebeckers accepted this eyebrow-raising expense because the province's investment arm took a 37 per cent stake in its promoter, Stornoway Diamond Corp. But that will not always be the case. François Legault, head of the Coalition Avenir Québec, which holds the balance of power in the Marois minority government, has also expressed concerns over the province's generosity toward mining companies. Another question is the fiscal environment. Inspired by the Australian model, whose virtues have attained mythical proportions in Quebec, the PQ campaigned to change the province's mining regime, which is based on a 16 per cent royalty on each mine's profits. They would replace it with a 5 per cent royalty on the gross value of production, coupled with a 30 per cent supertax on profits above an 8 per cent return on capital. These changes would bring in an extra $338-million in revenue to the government over five years. “The mining companies are very concerned, because since no detail was given out, they can't evaluate the financial impact of these proposals,” says Nochane Rousseau, partner and leader for the mining sector at PricewaterhouseCoopers. For instance, Australians can use the production-based royalty as a tax credit to be applied to the supertax on profits. Quebec producers don't know if they will enjoy the same treatment. Has the mining industry reached its limit, as the industry and the Liberals contend? Or can the government extract more income from Quebec's natural resources without jeopardizing the Plan Nord? That is the billion-dollar question. One thing is certain: The added uncertainty comes at a bad time, as producers are grappling with a global slowdown and depressed commodities, notably ore prices. Already, Labrador Iron Mines is cutting its capital spending, as its shipments to China from Sept-Îles, Que., are delayed by high inventories. Despite this setback, Sept-Îles, a northeastern city of 26,000 people that has become a Plan Nord hub, is bursting at the seams. With the huge influx of workers, the rental vacancy rate hovers around 0.3 per cent, there is no unemployment to speak of, and the minimum wage is a fading memory. The local McDonald's was so desperate it had to bring in seven workers from the Philippines. Sept-Îles will press on. But whether the Plan Nord will survive the PQ regime and truly resuscitate places like Schefferville, a 5,000-person mining town at the border of Labrador whose closing in 1982 was made famous by a heartbreaking Michel Rivard song – well, that is another story."
Will a warming planet and melting sea ice spur development in the Arctic? (+video),NL,"Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to an unprecedented low this summer, part of a long-term decline in the icy white cap over the far northern ocean. Researchers predict that nearly ice-free summers are on the way, although its not yet clear when this will happen. This shift has implications for climate in particular, it is expected to aggravate global warming and for the animals, such as polar bears and walruses, which depend on the ice for habitat. But the loss of ice over the Arctic Ocean also opens up the possibility for increased shipping, tourism, oil and gas exploration, and fishing. But this potential development raises challenges with which nations will have to grapple, said Anne Siders, a postdoctoral researcher with the Columbia Center for Climate Change Law, to an audience at Columbia University Wednesday (Sept. 19). Siders was among a panel of researchers who discussed the science behind the declining sea ice, the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and public perception of it. [10 Things You Need to Know About Arctic Sea Ice] A predictably open Arctic Ocean creates opportunities and challenges for nations that ring the Arctic. Here are some of them. The opportunities: Fishing: Warming ocean temperatures, migrating fish and changes in sea ice may create conditions favorable to the development of new commercial fisheries within the Arctic, according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A U.S. plan, approved in 2009, temporarily prohibits commercial fishing in U.S. Arctic waters until more information is available. More ship traffic: A journey through the Northwest Passage north of Canada or along the Northern sea route over Russia can cut thousands of miles off a trip that could otherwise require a ship to travel through the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal. Between 1906 and 2006, only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage, said Michael Byers, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. In 2010, 18 traveled through, and in 2011, 22 made the trip. As ice in the passage has dwindled, tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports. Gas and oil: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil, 1,670 trillion cubic feet (47.3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids most of it offshore. The quest for these resources is underway, in spite of setbacks. The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept. 17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast. The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier. The problems: Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem. NOAA's maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean, because thick, impenetrable sea ice kept ships out. In addition, most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s, according to NOAA. Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states, but the U.S. Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup, Siders said. Admiral Robert Papp, the Coast Guard commandant, has been quoted in the media as saying, ""The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic. If we are going to have a permanent presence there, it's going to require some investment. We don't have the infrastructure in place right now."" As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010, a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage, and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks] Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations, the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves, but the United States can't lay its own claim and has little say in others because the U.S. is not a party to the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty, CNN Money reports. There are other territorial issues as well, for instance, Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory, while other nations, including the U.S., maintain that it is an international strait. The loss of summer ice will not, however, transform the Arctic into the Caribbean. Some of the challenges to operating in the Arctic are and have been the same for a very long time, Siders said, adding these will remain at least to some degree, requiring people to work in the dark, in the cold, in the middle of a storm, as earlier arrivals have done before.

"Our empty legislatures, our disappearing politicians",NL,"OTTAWA -- There are 1,066 duly elected members of the House of Commons, provincial and territorial legislatures in Canada. Tuesday, not a single one sat in their legislative chamber. Not a single prime minister, premier, federal or provincial cabinet minister was formally being held to account under our Parliamentary system anywhere, from Victoria to St. John's, from Ottawa to Iqaluit. Yes, January is traditionally a dark month in our legislative chambers, but that does not diminish a growing trend in this country of governments under fire merely turning off the lights in their legislatures, leaving ornate buildings to tourists and political aides. Even those with comfortable majorities treat their legislatures like a nuisance, often with the tacit approval of provincial members who are quite happy to guard their turf in home constituencies, making noise only if they believe they are being denied a chance to go after a government in trouble or a minister grappling with scandal. Queen's Park has been closed since Dalton McGuinty prorogued the legislature last Oct. 15 and a frontrunner to replace him, Sandra Pupatello has suggested she will keep it closed until she can win a seat in a by-election, and good luck making a constitutional argument for that as a reason to keep elected representatives from doing their jobs. But Ontario is hardly alone. By the time British Columbia goes to the polls this spring, the legislature in Victoria will likely to have sat a grand total of 19 days in the previous calendar year, according to the number crunching of Mark Jarvis in a blog for Maclean's. Premier Christy Clark just shut it down last May 31. In Alberta, where Progressive Conservative Premier Alison Redford is facing a new era with a real opposition and the province is facing an oil glut and plunging revenue, the Edmonton legislature will not return until March 5 and is scheduled to sit 39 days. The opposition Wildrose, ignoring years of such behaviour by Ralph Klein, the king of the sporadic sittings, said Alberta is becoming a ""national embarrassment."" That may be overstating the fact, but government House leader Dave Hancock brought them closer to that status by telling the Edmonton Journal the length of the legislative sitting has ""no bearing on whether democracy is alive or not."" Remember your Christmas break? New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island legislators don't come back until March 26. Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Yukon haven't even bothered to set return dates. Newfoundland Premier Kathy Dunderdale didn't recall her legislature for six months after her 2011 election, but did allow the legislature to sit for 73 days in 2012. Doesn't sound like much? Only Ontario sat longer, according to the Parliament of Canada website. In 2012, the 13 provincial and territorial legislatures sat a combined 728 days. Twenty years ago, the 12 legislatures (minus Nunavut) sat a combined 842 days; 25 years ago, the dozen chambers sat for 838 days. The House of Commons sat for 129 days in 2012, longer than any other legislative body and will be the first one to open its doors in 2013 when MPs return next Monday. But a generation ago, the Commons routinely sat between 165 and 185 days in non-election years. Anecdotally, it appears Canadians don't much care about this and that's why leaders feel they can get away with it. Prime Minister Stephen Harper brought prorogation back into the vernacular and was re-elected with a majority in 2011. Anyone who spends any time in Ottawa knows that too much time is wasted here on picayune partisan posturing and MPs do have responsibilities in their constituencies. But these 1,066 men and women are elected to represent our interests in a Parliamentary forum. ""If you work in the private sector or are a public servant, you work at least 220 days per year,"" said Duff Conacher, the co-ordinator of Your Canada, Your Constitution. ""This is not to say MPs don't work when the House is not sitting, but they have staff to deal with most constituency issues. Their other job is to solve systemic problems and you need to pass legislation to do that."" When they don't sit, governments are not held accountable, Conacher says. Canadians are disengaging from politics. That could be because they rarely see their representatives in action. Or perhaps our politicians are using this disengagement as cover for their empty legislatures. Neither conclusion is good news for those who lament the erosion of democracy in this country. 0 days Number for Premier Dalton McGuinty and Ontario since Oct. 15. 39 days Number Premier Alison and Alberta MLAs will sit after March 5. 19 days Estimate for B.C.

Cruise ship without crew abandoned in stormy North Atlantic,NL,"The cruise ship M/V Lyubov Orlova was supposed to take tourists to the Canadian Arctic, its promotional brochure full of photos of polar bears, glaciers and northern lights. Instead, after idling for two years, vacant and rat infested, in St. John's harbour, the 100-metre-long Lyubov Orlova is now adrift without a crew in stormy Northern Atlantic waters, following two separate towing accidents. First, a tug boat hired by its owner lost the 4,251-tonne cruise ship 12 days ago as it tried to pull it to a scrapyard. The empty vessel then threatened to float into Newfoundland's offshore oil fields. Last Wednesday, Husky Energy used one of its supply ships, the Atlantic Hawk, to pull the Lyubov Orlova away as it came 50 kilometres from its offshore vessel, the SeaRose FPSO. By Friday afternoon, the Atlantic Hawk transferred the towing to another freighter, the Maersk Challenger, which had been chartered by Transport Canada, Husky spokeswoman Colleen McConnell said. A source in St. John's said that 20 minutes after the new ship began pulling the Lyubov Orlova, the tow line snapped. A tracking device was installed on the Orlova and it was then decided to let it drift away. Transport Canada abandoned the towing because of waves of up to seven metres and wind gusts of more than 140 kilometres an hour, spokeswoman Marie-Eve Higo said. “Continued efforts to tow the the Lyubov Orlova would have caused unacceptable risk to the crews of the towing operation,” she wrote in an e-mail. Transport Canada said the ship was no longer its concern, having left Canadian waters, but noted that the Lyubov Orlova's owner remains responsible for its movements. “The vessel has drifted into international waters, and given current patterns and predominant winds, it is very unlikely that the vessel will re-enter waters under Canadian jurisdiction,” the department said in a statement Saturday. The communiqué said the ship was about 50 nautical miles outside Canadian waters, and moving northeasterly. Federal court records show the owner is Hussein Humayuni, owner of Neptune International Shipping Inc. He could not be reached for comment. An article last year in the St. John's Telegram said that while the company is based in the British Virgin Islands, Mr. Humayuni is a Toronto resident. He was reported to have purchased the ship to dismantle it and sell the metal for scrap. Even before the recent events, the Lyubov Orlova had long made headlines. Cruise North Expeditions, a partner firm of the Quebec Inuit's Makivik Corp., wanted to charter the ship for summer cruises in the Arctic. Because of a financial dispute between Cruise North and the Russian ship owners, the Lyubov Orlova was seized when it arrived in St. John's in September, 2010. Local residents donated food, clothes and cigarettes to the stranded crew of 44 until they could be repatriated to Russia three months later. Last month, an American tug boat, the Charlene Hunt, was dispatched to pull the Lyubov Orlova to a scrapyard in the Dominican Republic. However, a day after leaving, on Jan. 23, the tow line broke and the Russian cruise ship went adrift. Halifax maritime blogger Mac Mackay was skeptical that the Charlene Hunt was adequate. “The tug, in my opinion is unfit for the job, and was very nearly lost just getting to St. John's, ” he wrote two weeks before the tow."
Fracking comes east - way east; West coast of Newfoundland may well be the next hot play,NL,"As a junior energy explorer comes closer to finding out whether North America's next big shale oil find lies beneath the western coast of Newfoundland, concerns are being raised about the environmental effects fracking could have in the remote region. Shoal Point Energy Ltd. spent the winter holidays hammering out a farmout deal with Black Spruce Exploration, a subsidiary of Foothills Capital Corp., that will enable as many as 12 exploration wells to be drilled over the next few years in the Green Point shale. After that, the companies aim to have a better idea of how much black gold can be coaxed out the narrow stretch of rock - and hopefully attract deeper pocketed investors to help scale up the discovery. ""It's not the big long-term solution yet,"" Shoal Point chief executive George Langdon said. As in other shale formations throughout North America, tapping the Green Point will require hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to unlock the resource. The process involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure in order to crack the rock. Fracking has unleashed huge supplies of natural gas and oil from shales across the continent, but it also brings with it controversy over its potential environmental effects. Bob Diamond, chairman of the Bay St. George Sustainability Network, said fracking has become a hot topic in his community. Less than a dozen people attended his group's first meeting on the issue, but that number swelled to 60 for a second gathering last week. ""We're not against oil or oil development or exploration,"" Mr. Diamond said from Stephenville, N.L. ""We want to ensure that it's not going to have any significant impact on our health or our environment."" In addition to the safety of the fracking process itself, Mr. Diamond said he's also worried about all of the trucks and heavy equipment moving around the area and the safety of drilling in a coastal region prone to wild weather. He also wants to make sure that other industries, such as tourism and fisheries, aren't harmed. ""I'd like to see a moratorium on gas and oil fracking,"" said Mr. Diamond. ""In Newfoundland, there's actually no kind of regulatory structure in place yet to deal with fracking, which alarms a lot of people."" He said recent fracking guidelines set out by the New Brunswick government seem to strike the right balance, and he'd like to see his province follow suit. David Murray, chief executive of Foothills Capital, said although fracking is new to western Newfoundland, the technology has been around for a long time and has been safely used around the world. ""We know that people will be concerned about it because they're not as experienced in this area as to what's involved. But do we see any real technical issues here? The answer is no,"" he said. He said there are no groundwater sources at risk from the drilling. Shoal Point, a small Toronto-based outfit, set up a data room last summer where potential partners could access company information. Firms from around the world - some large and some small - took a look at what Shoal Point had to offer. Mr. Langdon had expected the potential size of the Green Point - one estimate pegs it as having 23 billion barrels of oil in place - would be enough to lure a big-name partner. But so far no major firms have been reeled in, likely because there is still a lot of drilling to be done before they're convinced those barrels can be produced economically. ""I think that it's big enough now and they should be looking at it,"" said Mr. Langdon. ""It's a new area. Maybe not many people are as familiar with the geology as we are. In any case, that's the way they look at it and I think the time will come when we'll be very, very interested in it."" Once Shoal Point and Black Spruce have proven that oil can be produced from the rock, they can apply to the board for a significant discovery licence. Shoal Point is by far the biggest landowner in the Green Point, having amassed more than 280,000 hectares across its three blocks. Shoal Point owns 100% of two of those blocks and 80% of another. Shoal Point's activity so far has been at the south edge of the formation, which stretches north along the coast well past Gros Morne National Park. The Green Point extends into the offshore, but the wells are being drilled from on land into the formation. Recent fluid injection tests by Shoal Point's Houston-based contractor showed promising results when it comes to the rock's permeability. ""Every time we turn over a stone, things look better on the technical side. We're very, very happy about that,'' said Mr. Langdon. Mr. Murray said there's ""no question'' the Green Point holds a lot of oil, but it remains to be seen how much of it can flow to the surface on its own steam. ""There's only one way to determine that at this point from the technology that we have today, and that's to actually drill.''"
Today in History - March 8,NL,"Today in History for March 8: On this date: In 1698, the first meeting convened of the British group which later formed the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or SPCK Today, SPCK equips Christians throughout the world with financial grants, resources, advice and encouragement. Working with Christian communicators and educators in 60 or more countries, in an average year it supports about 200 projects. In 1702, England's Queen Anne acceded to the throne upon the death of King William III. In 1715, Roman Catholic King Louis XIV announced he had finally put an end to all Protestant practices in France. In 1765, the British House of Lords passed the Stamp Act, a means of raising revenue in the American colonies. In 1775, an unidentified person in Billericay, England became the first victim of a tar-and-feathering. In 1855, a suspension bridge was opened across the Niagara River at Niagara Falls, Ont. In 1867, the British parliament passed the British North America Act. Many MPs were not in the Chamber for final reading, but they rushed in immediately after to vote on a bill to place a tax on dogs. The act received royal assent on March 29 and Queen Victoria set July 1 as the date for Confederation. On this date 115 years later, in 1982, the British Commons passed the Canada Bill for patriation of the Constitution. In 1873, the Northwest Territories council prohibited the sale of liquor. In 1889, John Ericsson, who invented the first successful screw propeller, died. In 1894, New York dog owners became the first in the U.S. to license their pets. In 1907, the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan was established. It was later split into the current Court of Queen's Bench and Court of Appeal. In 1911, fingerprint evidence was introduced as a crime detection tool in a New York City case against a suspected burglar, who was convicted. In 1915, about 10,000 people marched on the Ontario legislature to present a huge petition -- 825,572 signatures -- demanding Prohibition. In 1917, riots and strikes in St. Petersburg marked the beginning of the Russian Revolution. In 1939, Sir Henry Pellatt, the millionaire who built Casa Loma in Toronto, died. He was 80. Pellatt had the castle built between 1911-14 at a cost of $2 million. Based on European designs, it had about 50 rooms and was lavishly decorated. Pellatt suffered financial losses in the 1930s and lost Casa Loma, which is now a tourist attraction. In 1942, ``Transit Through Fire: An Odyssey of 1942,'' the first opera commissioned by the CBC, was broadcast on the network. The music was by Healey Willan, and was orchestrated by Lucio Agostini. In 1945, the first International Women's Day was celebrated. Now celebrated by millions of women around the world, a variety of events are held to celebrate the achievements of women. The symbols for International Women's Day are bread and roses. Bread is for women's struggle for economic equality while roses represent women's continuing efforts for a better quality of life. In 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court, in McCollum v. Board of Education, struck down voluntary religious education classes in Champaign, Ill., public schools, saying the program violated the separation of church and state.

In 1982, the Canada Bill was passed by the British House of Commons by a vote of 177 to 33. The bill was passed on the 115th anniversary of the passage of the British North America Act of 1867. The bill allowed Canada to patriate its Constitution. In 1984, the cruise missile was first tested over Western Canada. The unarmed missile was attached to a B-52 bomber during the 2,500-kilometre flight. In 1984, a lengthy battle over offshore resources ended with the Supreme Court decision that the federal government owned the oil resources of the Hibernia field off Newfoundland. In 1993, the Canadian navy supply ship ``HMCS Preserver'' completed a three-month tour of Somalia. The crews of three Sea King helicopters airlifted 430 tonnes of supplies to the war-torn African country. In 1994, Rogers Communications and Maclean-Hunter struck a deal worth a total of $3.1 billion, to create one of Canada's largest media companies. In 1999, Alice Munro became the first Canadian to win the top fiction award from the National Book Critics Circle for her collection of short stories ``The Love of a Good Woman.'' In 1999, Joe DiMaggio, baseball's Yankee Clipper, whose 56-game hitting streak in 1941 endures as one of the most remarkable records in baseball or any sport, died of lung cancer at age 84. In 2001, the Canadian Navy announced women would be eligible for service on submarines beginning the following year. In 2004, actor Spalding Gray was confirmed dead after his body was pulled from the East River in New York, almost two months after he disappeared. In 2004, Todd Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks slugged Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore from behind and fell on top of him, leaving Moore with a broken neck, a concussion and facial cuts. Bertuzzi, who was suspended by the NHL for the rest of the regular season and playoffs, later pleaded guilty to criminal assault. He received a conditional discharge and was sentenced to probation and community service. Bertuzzi was not reinstated until the start of the 2005-06 season, largely due to the 2004-05 NHL lockout. In 2004, Iraq's Governing Council signed an interim constitution after weeks of wrangling, in a key step towards a planned handover of sovereignty by U.S.-led occupying powers to Iraqis on June 30, 2004. In 2004, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived for a two-day visit to Ottawa. In 2006, the Catholic Church in Ireland admitted that 102 of its priests in Dublin were suspected of sexually or physically abusing at least 350 children. In 2007, Governor General Michaelle Jean made a surprise visit to Afghanistan. In 2008, near record levels of snow fell in southern Ontario and Quebec, as much as 45 cm in some areas, before moving to the Maritimes, bringing rain, freezing rain and snow. In 2008, Serbia's prime minister dissolved the government and called for new elections after clashing with his pro-Western coalition partners over Kosovo and European Union membership. In 2008, Donald C. MacDonald, former leader of the CCF and the New Democratic Parties in Ontario, died in Toronto at age 94. Often called the best premier that Ontario never had, he represented the Ontario provincial riding of York South for the CCF for nearly 30 years, from 1955-82. In 2008, Quebec Liberals voted 97.2 per cent to back Premier Jean Charest as their leader. It was the highest level of support ever recorded by a party leader in Quebec. In 2009, Trooper Marc Diab, 22, from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, died and three other soldiers were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near their armoured vehicle on patrol northeast of Kandahar city in Afghanistan. In 2009, General Motors of Canada Ltd. and the Canadian Auto Workers union struck a crucial cost-cutting deal that would freeze wages and pensions, increase personal expenses for health care benefits, reduce employee holidays and eliminate annual bonuses. The cuts were critical for the company's survival plan and to qualify for loans from the federal and provincial governments. Members of the CAW voted overwhelmingly in favour of the deal. In 2010, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Vu Pham, 37, was shot and killed after pulling over a pickup truck near London. The suspect, Fred Preston, then became involved in a shootout with two other OPP officers and was critically wounded and died in hospital on March 11. In 2012, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird travelled to Myanmar to personally confer honorary Canadian citizenship on Nobel laureate and freedom fighter Aung San Suu Kyi.

At Tokyo's Ne Quittez Pas restaurant, you could get a whole new perspective – by eating dirt. Chef Toshio Tanabe recently rolled out a tasting menu with dishes such as soil risotto with sautéed sea bass, soil soup with black truffles, and soil ice cream. The 62-year-old former boxer, who bills himself as the “pioneer of soil cuisine,” sources his mineral-rich dirt from a Tokyo-area garden wholesaler, purifying it before serving it to customers. The only downside? At $110 (10,000 yen) a person, it's not dirt cheap.

From Trinity Bay to the world; Newfoundlander represented Canada's business and political interests far and wide,NL,"SEE CORRECTION AT END OF TEXT Morley Bursey's life and career was a century-long portfolio of Newfoundland and Canadian commerce and diplomacy. He dealt in goods and trade from Screech to NAFTA, with countries from Norway to Jamaica, beginning a decade before and lasting many decades after Confederation. Dashing and astute, he globetrotted when commercial air travel was just beginning, flying the clipper to Rio de Janeiro. He rode the 20th Century Ltd. from Chicago to Los Angeles. Well-connected, he seemed to know everyone. One of his first roles was with the civil service under the Newfoundland Commission of Government. During the Second World War he represented the British Empire at the Allied Food Commission, and in 1946 he acted as a member of the Newfoundland Fisheries Board, with offices in the Rockefeller Center in New York and a staff of 15, promoting Canadian fisheries and Newfoundland tourism. After two referendums, the commission was replaced by a new provincial and federal administration. He was anti-Confederate, but after Confederation he put personal beliefs aside and transferred to the Canadian Diplomatic Service, ably representing his new country. One of his first concerns was the fishery. “Canada's first fisheries specialist is a Newfoundlander,” Charles Clay wrote in Capital Comment in June, 1949. “The appointment of stocky, dark, vigorous Morley Byron Bursey as a Canadian Government Trade Commissioner (Fisheries Specialist) is a feather in the cap of both the Island and the Dominion … Islanders who know the friendly, efficient Mr. Bursey should not conceal their pride over the important trust placed in Mr. Bursey's hands … I was immediately entranced by Mr. Bursey's cordiality, modesty, and alertness. He may blush … He has had an intensely enviable record.” It was a reputation he would only build on. For 27 years he worked as a commercial councillor, consul-general, high commissioner, and ambassador to New York, Chicago, Detroit, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, Norway, Argentina, Greece, Turkey and Sweden. His dealings were incredibly varied. “I was privy to how the TD Bank got its first export order; how Canada sold a nuclear reactor to Argentina; how to advance military and industrial co-operation with Sweden, with a side order of a Volvo factory in Halifax for good measure,” his son James Bursey said at his father's memorial service. And this brought Mr. Bursey and his family to the front pages of history. “We saw our share of the changing world,” James said. “I remember my mother fending off Che Guevara revolutionaries in 1965 at our Argentine farmhouse (with a steely gaze and a Luger, I might add); we watched Israeli commandos light up the Beirut skyline from our hotel, ushering in the civil war in Lebanon with the New Year in 1968; our car was blown up in Athens in May of the same year; our house in Detroit was demolished in gasoline riots following the oil crisis in 1973.” Mr. Bursey retired in 1976. Which by no means meant he stopped working. He served as executive director of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and was involved in the framing the automotive portion of NAFTA, as well as the growth of the Japanese automotive manufacturing industry in Canada. He died on April 21 in St. John's. Morley Byron Bursey was born Jan. 1, 1912, in Old Perlican, Trinity Bay. He was educated in St. John's at Methodist College and Bishop Feild College and graduated from McGill University. From 1930 to 1932 he worked with the Aluminum Company of Canada in Montreal. In his early 20s, he was director of Bursey, Jackman and Company, a St. John's exporting firm. As Mr. Clay wrote, “The lines of his piscatorial career flowed straight as a taut halyard after that point.” St. John's in that time had a population of about 36,000 and the harbour was configured with finger piers. Frozen fish was just being pioneered. “The salt fish kept Newfoundland going,” Mr. Bursey told The Telegram in 2006. Then in his 90s, and living in Ontario, he made regular biannual trips home. “You couldn't walk down the street. It was very busy. Boats were coming in discharging fish. The inshore fishery was a hive of activity. Fish was being packed for the world markets of Britain, Argentina and the West Indies, Italy and Portugal. It all had to be graded.” During the war he arranged for imports of dark rum from Jamaica. Previous supplies, coming from British Guiana, had been interrupted. The new, 40-per-cent alcohol, burnt-sugar-darkened stock has become synonymous with Newfoundland culture. (By some nomenclatorial lore, people screamed when they first tasted it – which may have given it its name.) He met Olympic Champion Barbara Ann Scott, American presidents Harry S. Truman and Gerald Ford, and vice-president Nelson Rockefeller. President Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic and Greek prime minister Georgios Papadopoulos were among the figures who visited Mr. Bursey to drink and talk. It was the Mad Men era, with its ethos of work hard, play hard. “Being a New Year's baby he seemed to have an innate sense of putting people at ease, and making every occasion a really good party,” his son James said. “The smoking and the drinking (Beefeater martini, shaken not stirred, with a twist of lemon) were hallmarks of that postwar generation, never sure if the lights would go out for good at any moment – so live life to the fullest just in case. Through it all he always made you feel as though you were in on the party, you were in on the joke; you were the centre of attention. And that helped make him a very successful diplomat – because he was the genuine article.” Among many other interests (and a knack for closing down a dance floor) Mr. Bursey also played hockey and golf and loved motorboats. “He was also a great sailor himself,” James said, “and while in Norway and Sweden, on the appropriately named Beaver and Beaver II, we sailed to the Arctic Circle, Copenhagen, and around the Baltic. In those days before GPS, we also had to pay attention to navigation. On one stormy night we found safe haven at the end of a long pier. The following morning we awoke to a lifting fog, and to our surprise, at the end of the pier was a hut with two armed soldiers goosestepping. To our left, emerging from the fog, were the masts of the whole Soviet Baltic Fleet. We were in the centre of the Leningrad Naval Base.” Fortunately, diplomatic passports, and Seagram's VO, prevented an international contretemps. Mr. Bursey's passing was noted in the Senate Debates of April 30, 2013. Predeceased by his wives Catherine (Edgecombe) in 1955, and Jose Mary (Bass) in 2003, and his daughter Edith (Kooistra) in 2013, he leaves his sons Morley (called Derick) and James, as well as many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. CORRECTION Saturday, June 08, 2013 A Thursday obituary of Morley Byron Bursey incorrectly said he rode the 20th Century Ltd. Train from Chicago to Los Angeles. In fact, the train travelled between Chicago and New York."
Fracking puts Gros Morne at risk:UNESCO; Concerns over oil exploration plan near national park,NL,"ST. JOH N 's The UNESCO world heritage committee is recommending a monitoring mission be sent to Canada over ""serious concerns"" about potential oil exploration near Gros Morne National Park. Gros Morne, with its glacier-carved fjords, waterfalls, sandy beaches and spectacular cliffs, is a hiker's paradise that was designated a UNESCO world heritage site in 1987. But there are growing concerns about a proposal by Shoal Point Energy Ltd. and Black Spruce Exploration, a subsidiary of Foothills Capital Corp., to hunt for oil in shale rock layers in enclaves surrounded by the park. The plan involves using hydraulic fracturing - a contentious process known as fracking - to drill several exploration wells on Newfoundland's west coast in the Green Point shale near Gros Morne. Fracking injects a blend of water, sand and chemicals underground to crack the rock. The process has coaxed massive amounts of oil and natural gas from shales across North America, but has also raised environmental red flags, particularly over its effects on crucial groundwater. The world heritage committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is meeting this week in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where Gros Morne was discussed. At stake is the coveted designation reserved for the globe's most extraordinary treasures. The committee approved a draft decision late Wednesday that urged the completion of an Environmental Impact Assessment process to review the potential impact of the fracking plan on the park, and asked that a copy of that assessment be submitted to UNESCO. It also requested Canada to invite a ""joint World Heritage Centre/IUCN reactive monitoring mission to the property to assess these risks."" Additionally, the committee also wants, by Feb 1, 2014, an updated report on the state of conservation of the property. Potential fracking plans have not yet been filed for environmental assessment, but even the prospect of industrialization along one of the world's most celebrated coastlines has some people worried. ""I'm certainly not anti-development,"" said Sue Rendell, owner and operator of Gros Morne Adventures in Norris Point. But she said it's vital that any new industry be well-researched and understood, environmentally safe, and that it blend well with other businesses to benefit the whole region. ""We've spent our lives here trying to help build the tourism industry and build a business in this area,"" she said. ""I recognize that the oil and gas industry has been tremendous for the province. ""I think it's also very important to have a diversified economy. And we certainly can't have one industry that's going to be in direct opposition to another industry."" Premier Kathy Dunderdale this week acknowledged concerns about the safety of fracking and a lack of specific provincial regulations. She said the environment, along with health and safety, are top priorities for her Progressive Conservative government. ""As a government we don't have a hard and fast position on it at this point,"" she told reporters outside an oil and gas industry conference Tuesday. ""We're learning the same as everybody else is learning, and [are] prepared to have an open dialogue on that."" Regulatory changes could come later even as the government considers fracking proposals such as the one near Gros Morne, Ms. Dunderdale said. Investors want certainty and clarity, she acknowledged. ""But that doesn't trump the interests or the concerns of the people of the province. So that has to be addressed first."" Robert Cadigan, president and CEO of the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas Industries Association, said it's important to separate fact from fear. ""There have been tens of thousands of wells fracked in Western Canada, just as an example - successfully - with no environmental damage."" Mr. Cadigan said the industry's track record should be fairly assessed to see what precautions for well design and other safeguards would be needed. Alison Woodley, of the watchdog group Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said UN world heritage designation for Gros Morne can't be taken for granted. ""It's a very strict test that you have to go through to become a world heritage site. It recognizes the outstanding universal value of a place."" Gros Morne, honoured for its geological importance and pristine beauty, is on par with other UNESCO sites such as the Galápagos Islands and the Great Barrier Reef, Ms. Woodley said. It could be delisted if the world heritage committee decides that its unique qualities are threatened, she added. Fracking would pose environmental hazards while increasing truck traffic on the park's only major road, Ms. Woodley said. ""For 30 years people have worked really hard to build a sustainable tourism industry around Gros Morne, based on Gros Morne. And this proposal would put that existing economy at risk."""

In 2003, a provincial royal commission report said that the federal government must work with Newfoundland and Labrador to improve the state of the fisheries and ensure more benefits from offshore oil and gas. The report focused on the devastation of a once-lucrative fishery, the out-migration of 70,000 people in the previous decade and double-digit unemployment in each of the last 30 years. It concluded that Newfoundlanders were not interested in separation, but wanted to see a more effective working relationship with Canada.

Many of the dead were villagers who had descended on the truck to siphon fuel illegally from the wreckage. (The Canadian Press)"
Oil projects near heritage site raise alarms,NL,"OTTAWA -- The UNESCO World Heritage Committee says Gros Morne National Park on Newfoundland's west coast is a rare example of continental drift, where ocean crust lies exposed amid spectacular fjords, glacial valleys, sheer cliffs, waterfalls and pristine lakes. But Gros Morne is also at the top of a list of parks that the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) declares, in its annual report to be released Monday, to be at risk as a result of poor conservation strategies, a lack of fiscal resources, encroaching development or a combination of threats. In the case of Gros Morne, which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, CPAWS is concerned about a proposal by a junior exploration company to drill and frack for oil within metres of the park's boundary. It is calling on the area around the park to be kept permanently free of oil and gas development to protect both the ecosystems and the tourism economy. “If this were to go ahead,” said Alison Woodley, the national director of the CPAWS parks program, “it would be the start of industrializing that coastline and that's just not appropriate in an area that was protected and actually designated a World Heritage Site, both for its geological values but also for its pristine natural beauty.” The CPAWS report offered a mixed assessment of the state of Canada's national and provincial parks. While it cites major progress in 2013, especially at the provincial level where Quebec has established the largest protected area in eastern North America and Nova Scotia has announced plans to create hundreds of new parks, there are problem areas. The report says the resource proposal by Shoal Point Energy Ltd. and Black Spruce Exploration to look for oil in an enclave surrounded by the park poses a number of potential threats. The fracking process, it says, will mean the injection of toxic chemicals deep into the ground, which could lead to groundwater contamination. The report also expresses concern about intense trucking activities on park roads, the production of massive amounts of contaminated water that needs to be disposed of, and the potential for flaring of natural gas. David Murray, the president of Black Spruce, said in an e-mail that his company loves the park, and respects its natural beauty. Mr. Murray pointed out that there are other World Heritage Sites that have industrial development near their borders and said responsible shale oil development should not have any impact on Gros Morne's status. Black Spruce, he said, will monitor the drinking water, will repair any damage caused by its trucks, and will meet or exceed all regulatory requirements. Responding to the concern about natural-gas flaring, he said there is little or no gas in the locations that will be explored for oil."
Parks watchdog gives grades -,NL,"CANADA'S parks watchdog released its annual report card Monday, praising Manitoba for expanding and protecting pristine places here and warning of the dangers to parks in other jurisdictions. In its fifth annual report, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society said progress on creating new parks and protecting existing ones has been uneven across the country during the past 12 months. It lauded the Manitoba government for its new parks strategy announced in April as part of its ""Green Plan."" The strategy commits the province to strengthening protection for many of Manitoba's provincial parks and creating or expanding up to 10 parks. It also honours the watchdog's request to make ""maintaining ecosystem health"" the main principle of parks, the report said. ""Unfortunately though, danger signs are still flashing for Canada's parks in too many areas,"" the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society report said. In Newfoundland's Gros Morne National Park, a proposal to drill and frack for oil within metres of park boundaries presents a serious risk to the park's ecosystems, its UNESCO World Heritage status and the related tourism. Last year's parks report highlighted how the 2012 federal budget cuts of about $30 million per year were decreasing Parks Canada's science capacity and shortening operating seasons for national parks, including Riding Mountain in Manitoba. Local citizens mounted a campaign called ""Occupy Winter"" to draw attention to the park experiences being lost by turning national parks into seasonal destinations."
Parks under attack,NL,"If you're heading to one of Canada's more than 40 stunning national parks this summer, you might want to leave your bathing suit behind and bring a gas mask instead. A new report from the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society warns that ""inappropriate"" development projects are encroaching on Canada's parks, threatening the water, air quality, wilderness and wildlife, not to mention a booming tourist economy. In particular, the report singled out proposals to drill and ""frack"" for oil within metres of Gros Morne National Park, a 1,805-square-kilometre area in western Newfoundland, which UNESCO describes as a ""spectacular"" meeting of ""coastal lowland, alpine plateau, fjords, glacial valleys, sheer cliffs, waterfalls and ... pristine lakes."" The report cautions that fracking alone could sully that pastoral scene by contaminating ""local air, water and soil, creat-(ing) constant noise and heavy truck traffic, and harm(ing) wildlife and people."" Not very idyllic. That's why UNESCO contacted the federal government earlier this year to say that plans to extract oil near the park could jeopardize its world heritage site status. Gros Morne is not the exception. The Harper government should be commended for aggressively expanding national parkland over the last six years, establishing no fewer than five new parks since coming to power. But a closer examination of the government's policies suggests its commitment to preserving Canada's natural bounty doesn't run very deep. Take Sable Island, a small Atlantic land mass near Halifax. Last month, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May briefly blocked legislation that eventually succeeded in establishing the island as a National Park Reserve. Her problem: the bill explicitly ""opens the door to oil exploration on Sable Island and sets a dangerous precedent for the rest of our National Parks."" Or, take Naats'ihch'oh National Park Reserve, a 4,840-square-kilometre tract in the Northwest Territories. Established last year, the park protects large portions of the upper waterhead of the South Nahanni River, as well as the area's grizzly and woodland caribou habitats. All good. Except it could have been much better. Parks Canada proposed three versions of the reserve, of which the government selected by far the smallest and least popular among locals. The chosen proposal did, however, have the benefit of leaving 80 per cent of the area's potential mineral riches accessible for exploitation. As former N.W.T. premier Stephen Kakfwi put it: ""That is not a national park; that is a joke."" National parks exist to protect and provide access to our most important and impressive ecological sites. Clearly there is a moral imperative to do so. But there is also an economic one. A recently uncovered Environment Canada memo estimates that 13 per cent of our GDP depends on healthy ecosystems. Unfortunately, as the government well knows, pollution does not respect the artificial borders around protected areas. If the government has created these reserves in good faith and for reasons beyond politics, it will heed the scientists and stop development on the edges of our parks."
"Where whales rule the world - They may take a back seat to polar bears, but belugas are Churchill's wow factor D8",NL,"CHURCHILL -- There was suspense in the boat. The large beluga whale was behind us, maybe a foot under water, and maybe a foot to the side of the outboard motor and propeller. It had been tailgating us for a couple minutes. What was it doing? Then it lifted its head out of the water and nudged the right pontoon of our Zodiac, like pushing a beach ball. The eight of us tourists clutched our safety rope tightly. ""It wants to play with us,"" shouted Dwight Allen, who was at the tiller and who owns whale-watching outfit, SeaNorth Tours. Play with us? Play what? Water polo? As long as it didn't want to play pinata. It stayed right behind the boat. It looked spectral beneath the clear waters off Churchill, in the estuary where the Churchill River empties into briny Hudson Bay. What would it do next? It lifted its head again and gave our small watercraft another shove, but a shove so gentle, not clumsy at all, more like a whale in ballet slippers. Beluga whales. They're as cute as babies -- and as curious as cats. They've got a twinkle in their eyes and Mona Lisa smiles. With their bulbous heads, they look more like dolphins in football helmets. Every year, some 57,000 beluga whales descend into the western side of Hudson Bay -- 27,000 in the Churchill River estuary alone. Those are extraordinary figures in this age when belugas are threatened in places such as the east side of Hudson Bay, and the St. Lawrence River. The annual summer gathering near Churchill is one of the largest, if not the largest, concentration of beluga whales anywhere. Yet in Churchill it's still ""polar bear this"" and ""polar bear that."" Most of the T-shirts, mugs, and other souvenirs are geared to polar bears, and most of the outfitting is for polar bears. When National Geographic magazine framed Churchill's polar bears within its famous yellow cover margins in the 1990s, the northern Manitoba town shot from relative obscurity to the Polar Bear Capital of the World. But people here tell you Churchill is phenomenal in ways other than its 900 or so polar bears. The plant life, for example, is unlike anywhere else, part of a unique eco-system that includes tundra, taiga, boreal forest, and marine coastline. (I'm no expert, but we did see -- that is, our Rail Travel Tours group saw -- flora such as woolly willow and salmon-pink Indian paintbrush, the latter different from the reds and yellows you see on the West Coast.) It's also a birder's paradise, with species such as the willow ptarmigan, arctic tern, and common eider. (Again, speaking as a layman, the sighting of a grey-hooded Pacific loon, formerly called Arctic loons, sitting on her nest was a treat.) Belugas -- beluga just means white in Russian -- are the wow factor, however. Kristin Westdal is a marine biologist with Oceans North, a science-based conservation group funded by organizations such as PEW Charitable Trusts and Ducks Unlimited. Her research includes tracking the movements of six beluga whales in the west Hudson Bay with satellite transmitters. Westdal has gone whale-watching in many places including South Africa, Newfoundland and the West Coast. ""I've never seen anything like (Churchill),"" she said. ""When you go whale-watching at other places, you just see maybe a handful of animals. In Churchill, you see a thousand."" In summer, you can see the white whales from every vantage point. To the newly arrived tourist, it looks like white caps out in the harbour until someone tells you those are whales. The belugas, often several in a row, go diving along the surface of the water in chase of capelin, a small smelt fish. We got right into the midst of their feeding frenzy in our Zodiac. Once they became accustomed to us, they swam behind, under, and around our boat. They tend to nudge boats to see how buoyant they are or to determine what they are made of. They do the same with kayaks. But no one has ever been tipped over, or at least so local people assure you. ""They're curious. They're turning on their sides, eyeballs looking up at you. That curiosity stimulates people who are viewing them. It's an interesting correlation,"" said Allen, SeaNorth Tour operator. Seeing as we are a coastal province, Manitobans should at least know these beasts a little better. ""It's hard to imagine a whale as friendly as the beluga whale,"" said Steve Ferguson, marine mammalogist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Belugas aren't aggressive at all. They are good-natured, very social, and one of the most vocal of whales, he said. But although it looks like they are often smirking away to themselves, thanks to unusually flexible mouths, researchers don't believe that's the case. Their lips are used to make a great range of noises. ""They communicate with all sorts of sound. They seem to interact with boats and people. It seems to be more in their nature than other whale species,"" said Ferguson. Allen dropped a hydrophone into the water, attached to a small portable speaker, so we could listen in. They're veritable chatterboxes down there. We mostly heard high-pitched squeals, not of pleasure, not haunting either, but more like someone trying to communicate with inflections only. For this, they are often called ""sea canaries."" The beluga has an amazing repertoire of clicks, moos, squeaks, squeals, trills and twitters. It also uses sound waves to find its prey, like a bat, or to find holes in the ice for surfacing. This is called echolocation. ""They can track their fish. You can hear the clicks they make that speed up as they move closer to their prey. Then the clicks become almost like a buzz,"" said Ferguson. They're not the largest whales, but at a length of three to five metres are about medium-sized among the various species, and weigh up to 1,000 kilograms. It was once thought they lived to be 20 to 30 years of age but that changed when one was discovered living to 75 years. They can dive a kilometre down but that's in the Hudson Strait; Hudson Bay isn't that deep. Belugas routinely hold their breath for 20 to 25 minutes but can go longer. They have flexible necks and will twist their heads around to look back at you as they swim by. They eat small fish such as capelin, and sand lance, a thin, snake-like fish. Whales are driven to congregate at the estuaries of rivers such as the Churchill and Nelson each summer, but the researchers aren't sure why. One reason appears to be molting. They enter the shallow waters and rub off their old skin on the small stones of the river bottom. It's also a safe place to raise their young. Killer whales can't go into the shallow waters. There have been increased sightings of Orcas in the area in recent years, which some attribute to more ice-free days on the Bay due to global warming. The beluga migration into estuaries helped determine the settlement patterns for aboriginal peoples along the Bay. Estuaries such as the Seal, Churchill, Nelson, Winisk and Severn rivers guaranteed a supply of whales to hunt in summer. It also helped convince Hudson Bay Company to set up its first post in Churchill in 1689. Its first export was not furs but 28 casks of white whale oil to London. HBC continued whaling in the 18th and 19th centuries, and local people always had whale oil on hand for lighting lamps. HBC stopped its whaling business in 1931. A whaling station was started in 1949. Hunters were paid by the foot for their whales. Belugas here were hunted for sport, too, from the 1940s into the 1960s, often by tourists coming up from the United States. Canadian Club whiskey even ran a magazine ad, in what must have been the golden age of male machismo, circa 1950, under the heading, Whale of a Battle. The ad celebrates sportsmen killing whales off the coast of Churchill and having a drink afterward. The ad begins: ""Harpooning the 'white whale' of Hudson Bay is like playing tag with a giant."" A series of photo illustrations depict harpooning the beluga whale, and later, when the whale has tired out, a man standing in a boat and shooting the whale with a rifle. In the last photo, two men are seated enjoying ice-filled glasses of whiskey. Genetic biologist Lianne Postma, who studies whale genetics for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, has a reprint of the ad tacked up in her office for amusement. Whale-hunting tourism is also described in Lyn Harrington's travel book, Manitoba Roundabout (1951). Her husband, Richard, went out into Churchill's harbour in just a regular-sized open fishing boat with two men who were getting whale meat for their huskies. The driver at the tiller crowded a beluga into shallow waters and the man in the bow drove a harpoon into it. ""The whale started ahead very swiftly, and the boat was going faster than the motor could make it,"" Richard related. A few minutes later, the man in the bow threw out a drum attached to the harpoon line ""and we watched it dodging back and forth across the water pulled by the whale."" A storm interrupted the hunt but the barrel marked the whale's location. When the storm subsided, the hunters positioned over the barrel and waited for the whale to blow. When it surfaced, the bowsman put a bullet through its head. Then they towed it to shore. The cutting up of the whale on shore gave off a suffocating stench, wrote Harrington -- except to the sled dogs. ""The huskies went wild as the pungent odour reached their nostrils."" People today think it's extraordinary wasteful to kill a whale to feed one's dog team, but the fur trade was very important to the community in those days, and snowmobiles hadn't been invented. Whale meat was petrol for the dogs. It was also used by trappers as bait. When the whaling station was operated in Churchill from 1949-67, its whale oil was sold for making margarine, lubricating fluid, soap and cosmetics, according to a history compiled by Lorraine Brandson, curator of the Churchill Eskimo Museum. The liver was sold for animal food, and steaks were sold to Winnipeg stores for the table market. Carcasses and bones were ground into 50-pound bags for dog food and fur farms, which were plentiful back then, and hides were used to make leather. The station closed in 1968 after markets ebbed and concerns of mercury contamination rose. The whales are still hunted by Inuit people farther north but in a sustainable manner. When hunting in this area stopped in 1967, whale hunters began capturing belugas for zoo aquariums around the world. They captured a handful a year -- about 65 in total between 1967 and 1992. They had developed a very humane method of capture, one local people were proud of and that was overseen by a Department of Fisheries and Oceans observer. George Lundie, a Cree man living in Churchill, was part of the team that captured whales. They would first coral the whale into shallow waters by slapping the water from a fishing boat. Then men in wetsuits sprang into action. ""You have a rope-like lasso and you'd dive off the bow and put the lasso around the whale's head,"" Lundie said. A second man, also wearing a wetsuit, jumped on the tail. That was usually Lundie's job. ""They're strong,"" he said, but the beluga would calm down within a minute. ""That's why they called us Cold Water Cowboys. We even had T-shirts made,"" he said. He played me a videotape of a local capture, produced decades ago by the Inuit Broadcasting Corporation. Once captured, more men in wetsuits jumped into the water to lift the beluga into a second boat. The whale was lifted into a big, cushioned, sling-like apparatus. People kept sponging the beluga until they got it into a large holding tank on shore. It took about a dozen men to raise the whale into the holding tank. ""They'd keep it and study it and make sure it was healthy. If it wasn't healthy, we'd have to release it,"" Lundie said. The capture brought together the Dene, Cree, and Inuit people. ""It was something the people of the area were really proud of,"" said Brandson. ""It was exciting times when they had a whale capture. Everyone felt the town was contributing to science."" Then Greenpeace moved in with protests, arguing the practice was inhumane, and disrupted the captures. The activists consolidated the community even more. Greenpeace activists were refused lodgings and gasoline in Churchill. But the protest eventually reached all the way to Ottawa and the federal government soon outlawed the beluga capture program. Beluga whales are now captured in Russia for the aquarium market. For the past two decades, the only capture or shooting of belugas in Canada has been with camera shutters. To tour operator Allen, that's just fine. He opposes the whale capture, saying very few of the captured belugas ever bred successfully. Besides, hunting scares away the belugas for his tour operation. He even has trouble with the tagging program by researchers in the area where transmitters are riveted onto the backs of whales. He says it makes the belugas skittish for a couple weeks. He would rather researchers tagged whales on the Nelson River estuary, south of Churchill. ""From way back when to now, we've evolved in a sustainable way. I can honestly say I'm proud to where we've evolved to,"" Allen said. Yet many people still only know Churchill as the ""polar bear capital."" Will it take another National Geographic cover to change that? ""It's hard to change people's views,"" said Allen. It's also little known that two important offices are located in Winnipeg, thanks to the whale population on the west side of Hudson Bay. One is Oceans North, and the other is the federal Marine Mammal Population Genetics Laboratory, run by Lianne Postma. Postma said people are still baffled to learn the lab is based in Winnipeg, and includes people in her field. ""A lot of people who study whales will say to me, 'You study whales and you live in Winnipeg?' I say to them one of the most wonderful concentrations of whales happens off the shore of Manitoba every year. Most people I talk to have no idea."" bill.redekop@freepress.mb.ca The beluga While beluga whales number about 57,000 in the west side of Hudson Bay, according to DFO's most recent survey, the number is about 4,000 on the eastern side. Over-fishing is the reason belugas are threatened on the east side. They are a toothed whale but their teeth are only used for grinding and they aren't a threat to bite. Their blubber, an Inuit delicacy, is an energy reserve and an insulator, measuring eight centimetres thick. Yet belugas are also susceptible to environmental stresses. Beluga health can be an excellent mirror of the health of their ecosystem as a whole. In more southern climates, like the St. Lawrence Seaway, whales have picked up alarming levels of chemical contaminants, PCBs, mercury and flame retardants. Satellite monitoring has revealed that belugas often travel under dense pack ice for hundreds of kilometres. They use their echolocation abilities to find holes in the ice to surface. -- Source: Department of Fisheries and Oceans"

A blue-eyed Irish Newfoundlander with a keen intellect and a wicked sense of humour. This was John Michael McGrath, son of a doctor and a politician, and a great-great-grandnephew of the man who figured out how to lay Marconi's transatlantic cable. John was also a bureaucrat, a pilot, village mayor, game officer, philanthropist, bridge player, wordsmith, graduate of the National Defence College (NDC) and honorary colonel of search and rescue. He was a proud Canadian who embodied his Newfoundland roots, a man of real and lasting connections with correspondents from every part of the world. Wherever he travelled, people knew him – a trait that confounded the other NDC members with whom he travelled the world on a study year. His co-travellers challenged him to find someone he knew in each of the 23 countries they visited. John won. This one-and-the-same man would finish his workday as assistant deputy minister of northern development, lumber through the front door of his home and, fully clothed, climb into his grandchildren's bath with them. He had a most unconventional way of being in the world. A special part of John's life was taking his children and grandchildren on road trips. He used the journeys to spend time together, to share stories and to meet new people with them along the way. He was great fun to be around, a masterful communicator in any language, for any age. John had good judgment. In his own words, written about his earlier career: “(After a year at National Defence College), I returned to Goose Bay to find that my position had been filled, so I retired from the Newfoundland government when I found out that I was to be reassigned to the offshore oil file and, considering the advice of that famous philosopher Clint Eastwood, ‘It is a wise man who knows his limitations,' I decided to go back to my old job in the Northwest Territories as superintendent of economic development and tourism.” John and his wife Judy retired from the Arctic to Pakenham, Ont., in 1994, having built a life that allowed their five children to thrive in many cultures. He immersed himself in volunteer work for the library, a subsidized housing complex and the Seniors Eat program. As “souperintendent” for the seniors, he made soups and bread for a community lunch each week. John was a delightful sight in winter in his Arctic parka, kamiks and crocheted tuque, with his beloved dog Candy by his side. When a stroke, kidney failure and cancer landed him in hospital, a doctor arrived to deliver a fourth diagnosis of diabetes. John replied: “You tell Mr. Diabetes to stand in line at the door!” It did, but another stroke claimed him three years later.

"Why Canada and the U.S. Should Merge, Eh?; It's past time for the two countries to eliminate their border",NL,"When Americans think about Canada—and that doesn't happen often—they usually think of us as the nice, predictable guy next door who never plays his stereo too loud. Even Rob Ford, Toronto's ranting, crack-smoking mayor, has barely dented our squeaky-clean image. But Americans shouldn't just think more about Canada. They should consider building on the two countries' free-trade deal and forming a more perfect North American union. It is past time for the U.S. and Canada to eliminate their border—either by creating a customs and monetary union or, more radically, by merging outright into a single nation-state or a European Union-style partnership. Such a merger makes perfect sense. No two countries on Earth are as socially and economically integrated as the U.S. and Canada. They share geography, values and a gigantic border. Their populations study, travel and do business together and intermarry in great numbers. If they were corporations (or European states), they would have merged a long time ago. And each has what the other needs: The U.S. has capital, manpower, technology and the world's strongest military; Canada has vast reserves of undeveloped resources. Of course, even the most mild-mannered Canadian may sputter at the prospect of being swallowed up by the U.S., and Americans may wonder about the wisdom of absorbing their huge neighbor. But it needn't be so radical. Nobody is proposing that Canada become the 51st state. Like modern businesses, modern nations must constantly recalibrate their economic and political models. The smartest people in a room prevail until a smarter group comes along. And unless winners adapt, they eventually lose out, in economic and political life as in nature. Today's U.S. or Canada could become tomorrow's Portugal or Greece. In the competitive and interconnected world of the 21st century, countries that stand still will be left behind. The two North American neighbors increasingly find themselves staring down the barrel of state capitalism, as practiced above all by China, whose state-owned enterprises and sovereign-wealth funds have made a concerted effort to capture markets and resources. In October, the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook database forecast that by 2018, China's economy will be bigger than that of the U.S.—and Asian economies will be bigger than those of the U.S., Canada, Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Russia combined. If Canada and the U.S. were to join forces, the tables might well be turned. The North American neighbors would become an even more formidable superpower, with an economy larger than the European Union's and a land mass bigger than South America's. The new union would top the world in energy, minerals, water, arable land and technology, and all of it would be protected by the U.S. military. Size matters. Canadians have traditionally bristled at the thought of falling under the sway of the U.S., but without a deeper cross-border partnership, we face some grim existential challenges. With its small, aging population and relatively small economy, Canada lacks the resources to develop and defend its gigantic piece of real estate. Through a series of aggressive buyout attempts and transactions, China has targeted Canada's resources and empty landmass. In 2007, Russia used a small submarine to symbolically plant its flag on the ocean floor beneath the North Pole and underscore its claim to a large swath of the resource-rich Arctic, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been pushing the U.N. to affirm his claims to the region. The U.S. faces serious challenges of its own. It must create millions of jobs for its relatively young population, and even as its political system grows more sclerotic, it must compete for markets, resources and Arctic access with the aggressive practitioners of state capitalism. Truth be told, the merger of the U.S. and Canada is already well under way. As many as one in 10 Canadians (more than 3 million people) live full- or part-time in the U.S., and an estimated 1 million Americans live in Canada. As of 2010, U.S. enterprises controlled about 10% of Canada's assets, 17% of its revenues and 13% of its corporate profits, according to Statistics Canada. Canadians bought more goods and services from Americans than did the 340 million people living in the European Union—a population 10 times as large. A still deeper integration could drive major economic growth. Canada's hinterland is largely without infrastructure or development, even though it contains enormous untapped natural resources. Political disputes have also stranded some of the world's most promising hydroelectric and tidal power prospects in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Despite the powerful logic of a U.S.-Canada merger, the obstacles remain daunting. Both countries are divided politically and heavily regionalized. To execute so audacious a move would require a level of statesmanship now lacking in both countries. But remember, the Europeans pulled off something far more dramatic, uniting populations that shared no language and had slaughtered one another for centuries. Other recent examples of deeper integration include the Eastern Caribbean Economic and Monetary Union and the Economic Community of West African States. They all did it by opening their borders to trade and travel—while at the same time leaving governments intact. Opinion surveys about an outright merger are scant, but as far back as 1964, a poll showed support from 49% of Canadians. In 2007, the World Values Survey Association, a research network of thousands of social scientists, found that about 77% of Americans and 41% of Canadians said they would opt for political union if it meant a better quality of life. In 2011, another poll by Harris/Decima showed that 65% of Canadians backed greater integration with the U.S. and supported a plan to eliminate the border by blending U.S. and Canadian customs, immigration, security and law enforcement efforts. Those who oppose such a merger are on the wrong side of history. When the North American Free Trade Agreement passed in 1987, the U.S. and Canada (along with Mexico) began a mutually beneficial process of integration that now needs strengthening. Untended, the border has become clogged, damaging trade and tourism. And the wolves are at the door. Just this year China, Inc. picked off a large Canadian oil company and a large American food processor and exporter, without promising either country any reciprocal buyout privileges in China. Serious discussion of a merger should be a top priority for both the U.S. and Canada. The continental neighbors need one another more now than ever before, and the status quo grows less viable by the day. "
Newfoundland's new northern frontier,NL,"From Cape Spear, the most easterly point in North America, tourists imagine they can see Ireland. But Newfoundlanders are increasingly looking north - towards a new trade route to China. Their interest has been whetted by an article entitled ""New Trans-Arctic shipping routes navigable by mid-century,"" written by UCLA professors Laurence Smith and Scott Stephenson and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The article examines sea-ice projections from the world's most respected climate models, and concludes the Northwest Passage will be a reliable international shipping route by 2040-2059. The article also compares the length of three Arctic routes - the Northwest Passage, the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Russia, and a new route directly across the Arctic Ocean - and determines the Northwest Passage will be the most economic choice between Asia and eastern North America. St. John's was the North American port chosen for these calculations, because ships travelling south from the Northwest Passage turn a corner around easternmost Newfoundland. Newfoundlanders already profit from servicing cruise, supply, fishing and seismic ships headed to the Arctic. Now, they hope to benefit from international cargo vessels. In September, the Danishowned Nordic Orion became the first bulk carrier to traverse the Northwest Passage, transporting coal from Vancouver to Finland. Bulk carriers will generate some business for Newfoundland, but container ships are the real prize. Container routes require transhipment ports where shiploads of containers can be assembled or disassembled, and redistributed onto other vessels, so that each container takes the most efficient route to its destination. Transhipment ports generate long-term investment and jobs, while serving as magnets for other industries. In August 2013, the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company sent the first container ship through the Northern Sea Route. Iceland is already planning a transhipment port to serve container shipping from the Northern Sea Route and Arctic Ocean. A similar transhipment port for the Northwest Passage could transform St. John's into a smaller version of Singapore. But the opportunity could be missed - unless the federal government invests in Arctic services and infrastructure. The Nordic Orion's voyage was relatively safe because the ship was ice-strengthened and accompanied by the Canadian Coast Guard's largest icebreaker, the Louis S. St. Laurent. But icebreaker escorts cannot currently be assured. The Louis and Canada's other less-capable icebreakers are all nearing retirement. Only one new icebreaker is planned, and its construction has repeatedly been delayed. The Royal Canadian Navy has no ice-capable ships, and the long-promised Arctic/Offshore Patrol vessels will not be able to break ice for other vessels. Advanced weather and iceforecasting capabilities are needed to support shipping in the Northwest Passage, where storms and ""growlers"" - small chunks of icebergs that float low in the water - will always pose risks. International cargo ships also require quality charts, clearly defined shipping lanes, and ports where they can seek refuge in the event of mechanical problems or storms. But only one-tenth of Canada's Arctic waters have been charted to modern standards, and there are no shipping lanes or ports along the Northwest Passage. Canada also lacks a meaningful search-and-rescue presence in the Arctic. Our search-and-rescue helicopters are based in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Labrador. Pollution is another concern, because cargo ships carry large amounts of fuel oil. In 2004, a Malaysian bulk carrier was blown aground during a storm off southern Alaska, spilling 1.2 million litres of oil. The Northwest Passage will not be a truly viable shipping route until the equipment and personnel necessary to clean up a sizable spill are present in the region. International shipping companies will also look to Canada to resolve its longstanding dispute with the United States over the legal status of the Northwest Passage. Just as oil companies refuse to drill in contested waters, shippers shy away from waterways where the extent of the coastal state's regulatory power is unclear. But while the opportunity for a Northwest Passage transhipment port might be lost on Ottawa, it prompts real excitement in St. John's. The old naval base at Argentia, just 130 kilometres south of here, has a large and well-protected harbour that is ice-free throughout the year. It also has a considerable amount of unutilized flat space that is perfect for handling containers. Indeed, the Icelandic companies Eimskip and Samskip are already using Argentia as a transhipment location for containers being transported between Reykjavik and eastern North America. The Vikings, of course, discovered this island. The presence of their descendants at Argentia provides a strong validation for modern day Newfoundlanders, looking north towards a new frontier. Michael Byers holds the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of International Law and the Arctic, recently published by Cambridge University Press."
The south needs Churchill -,NL,"Canada claims it is an Arctic nation, yet its only Arctic seaport, Churchill, has been struggling for survival since the military abandoned the place 35 years ago. Russia has 13 thriving ports on the Arctic Ocean, Norway at least four, the Americans have two in Alaska. The Russians recently opened a new port in the gas-rich Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia. It will be open year round, handling more than 30 million tons of goods per year. Yet Churchill hangs by a thread, even as Prime Minister Stephen Harper makes Arctic sovereignty a strategic goal. Both the province and Ottawa have a stake in ensuring the commercial success of the port, which is why they jointly established a task force two years ago to report on its economic opportunities. It's the latest in a series of studies -- the issue has been on the federal agenda since the 1950s -- but unlike the others, it should not be filed in a drawer and forgotten. The task force came up with some of the same recommendations as previous reports, but they are updated and expanded for current conditions, including a restructured grain industry, expanding resource development and climate change that could lead to much higher volumes in Arctic shipping and navigation. Among other things, the report says an oil pipeline that could carry Alberta crude to Churchill should be considered once the environmental risks have been assessed. In fact, it says the private sector wants to build such a pipeline. It also says U.S. and Canadian producers are interested in moving light sweet crude by rail to Churchill and possibly returning south with a cargo of bitumen diluents for Alberta's oilsands. The task force endorses this idea, even though Manitoba is officially opposed, citing the environmental risk. It's possible the northern railroad is unsuitable for oil shipments, but the Selinger government should at least retain an open mind. The report identifies numerous obstacles to achieving progress in Churchill, particularly on the energy side, but also on the suitability of Churchill as a viable port. It's relatively shallow depth at low tide, for example, is not suited to loading the heavy ships that carry oil. The goal of expanding tourism -- the report talks about promoting the Arctic Safari Experience -- is complicated by a limited season, which itself explains the limited hotel options. In fact, there are obstacles and barriers for just about every proposed solution, but nowhere does the report suggest they are insurmountable. The federal and provincial governments have primarily been responsible for keeping Churchill afloat in the past, but the report says the private sector must be the principal driver in the future. With new Arctic sea routes emerging and renewed interest in developing the North, however, the chances of success have never seemed higher. New resource exports, such as potash, minerals, liquefied natural gas, oil and bitumen, in addition to grain, are a natural starting point. Churchill also offers numerous opportunities for travellers drawn to adventure, nature and the rugged outdoors. The real problem is Churchill has been a political sideshow for too long. No government wanted it to die, but neither did they do anything to ensure it took off. Canada is falling behind other countries in northern development, but Churchill itself faces competition from Quebec and even Tuktoyaktuk, which will soon be connected to Canada's highway network through the Yukon. As the author of a 1969 report on Churchill said: ""The majority of people in southern Manitoba, as the majority of Canadians generally, fail to appreciate that it is the south that will be the beneficiary of northern development."" Those words were never truer, but they will be just as meaningless unless Ottawa and Manitoba lay the groundwork for a surge of entrepreneurial activity in and around Churchill."
Residents want permanent fix for oil-leaking shipwreck,NL,"ST. JOHN'S -- There are growing concerns as winter pounds the northeast edge of Newfoundland that small oil leaks from a vessel that sank in 1985 west of Fogo Island could get much worse. Newfoundland and Labrador's Natural Resources Minister Derrick Dalley is meeting this week with federal officials as worried residents call for action about oil seeping from the Manolis L wreck 60 metres under Notre Dame Bay. “It's fearful,” Mr. Dalley said in an interview Monday. “We understand the importance of the environment. The ecosystem out there is important to the economy of the region. We're a strong tourism area as well.” Mr. Dalley said he'll meet Wednesday with Canadian Coast Guard officials and Rob Moore, the regional minister in the federal government cabinet, to discuss what he said is Ottawa's duty to deal with the shipwreck. The Liberian-flagged vessel sank after it ran aground in January, 1985, on Blow Hard Rock near Change Islands. It went down loaded with more than 500 tons of fuel oil and diesel. Reports of surface sheens prompted the Coast Guard last spring to install neoprene gaskets to plug hull cracks. In July, it lowered a device called a cofferdam to catch leaking oil. Another sheen was spotted in October but the Coast Guard said at the time that amounts were relatively small and unrecoverable. But reports from hunters in late December of more sheens, oiled seabirds and the smell of oil raised fresh alarms. Mr. Dalley said any cleanup is Ottawa's responsibility and he'll express concerns from residents who want a long-term fix. “We want to know there's no oil leaking … that's going to in any way negatively impact the ecosystem in the region or the shoreline.” Coast Guard spokesman Bob Grant said the cofferdam has shifted slightly and will be replaced as soon as weather permits with two larger, heavier devices. A Transport Canada surveillance flight Saturday reported no sheens in the area and a Coast Guard vessel in the region since late December has not seen any evidence of more leaks, he added. “Our immediate focus is to get these new cofferdams in place,” Mr. Grant said when asked about possible long-term solutions, such as draining oil from the vessel. The Manolis L sits on the ledge of a subsea mountain ridge. Its position adds to the complexity of an operation requiring a remotely operated underwater vehicle and larger vessels for support, Mr. Grant explained. He urged the public to report any and all oil sightings. Oiled birds should be reported to the Canadian Wildlife Service, he said. Professor Bill Montevecchi, a sea-birds specialist at Memorial University of Newfoundland, said more should be done to ease communication between fishermen and hunters – what he described as the first line of surveillance – and Coast Guard officials. “They're trying, but it's patchwork and clearly it's an accident waiting to happen,” he said of federal efforts to stop more pollution from the vessel. Prof. Montevecchi said reports of oiled birds and surface sheens cover at least a 20-kilometre area around the wreck site. “That oil's not going anywhere except to the surface and the subsurface. It's going to get out of that boat.”"
"In Canada, a Fishing Town Ponders Its End",NL,"LITTLE BAY ISLANDS, Newfoundland-- Alma Budgell is the last of 12 children born to a fishing family still living in this picturesque community. Now, she hopes to be among the very last people ever to live here. The village has no retail shop and a school with just two children. Founded almost two hundred years ago, the town thrived with Newfoundland's once mighty fishing industry and declined along with it. Only some 90 people, most of them older than 60, still live here year-round. Its tale of a dwindling and aging population is not uncommon among small towns in the Western world, but residents here have an unusual resettlement option. Sixty years ago, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador began offering its shrinking outposts money to close down and move on. After a nearly four-decade lull, the number of communities seeking resettlement has been ticking up, as the older sea-faring generation fades and the government has raised the value of its offers. The province is reviewing inquiries from six communities. Little Bay Islands is set to decide its future in a vote in the spring. The vote comes as other parts of the province are booming thanks to a new bounty from the sea, oil. It has split residents, stoking local tension ahead of a decision some say would kill a village with deep roots in one of the prettiest parts of Canada. Ms. Budgell, 58 years old, has lived her entire life here. She said she will vote yes to leaving. ""It's like a prison here,"" she said. She remembers a community filled with children and a vibrant social life, where ""steamers"" would bring visitors as well as buyers for the plentiful fish and crabs. On a recent Sunday, the community hall was opened so locals could play darts, drink and socialize. Only three people showed up, she said. Signs of the town's fishing past are everywhere, from the piles of lobster traps to the fishermen's huts that hug the rocky bay. Its decline also is on display, in empty streets and abandoned stores. Fishing jobs in Newfoundland long have been disappearing. In the late 1980s, the industry employed around 13% of the province's workers, according to the provincial Department of Finance. That tailed off sharply to 3% currently, as fish stocks fell and after the government put a moratorium on cod fishing about 20 years ago. Four years ago, the local fish-processing plant closed, hit by lower government quotas for snow crabs, among other factors, said Pete Eveleigh, who was CEO of the company that operated the facility. The closure led to the loss of about a hundred jobs, including Ms. Budgell's. ""That is when the island began to die,"" she said. Her husband, Dennis Budgell, has lately been helping to take down the shuttered plant, one of the few job opportunities that came his way in 2013. ""I just can't get work here, and I am not ready for retirement,"" the 61-year-old said. Mr. Budgell is the local councilor who first contacted the government to apply for resettlement. Hundreds of outposts in Newfoundland and Labrador shut down in the mid-20th century, as the fishing industry underwent structural changes and some residents sought better educational opportunities and a wider range of jobs. About 28,000 people relocated between 1954 and 1975, according to the provincial government. The resettlement program faded as government support did, amid complaints from some of those displaced that they were forced out and as some struggled to find jobs in their new communities. Its mark can still be seen in the deserted villages that dot parts of the coast. Almost every summer, Ernest Taylor, 70, returns to Grole, the fishing village he says his family was ""forced"" to leave in 1969. Now, all that is left of the village, on the island's rugged southern coast, are gravestones. ""Rural Newfoundland has been pretty much destroyed,"" said Mr. Taylor, a retired teacher living in Grand Bank, a nearby town. Little Bay Islands villagers who don't want to leave say the government wants to shut them down to save money on essential services. A spokesman for the Department of Municipal and Intergovernmental Affairs said that while relocations occur only when they save the province money, the province has been responding to requests for resettlement, rather than initiating moves. Residents who don't want to move are not forced to leave, he said. The ferry service that connects Little Bay Islands to the mainland, a 30-minute journey, costs 2.9 million Canadian dollars (about US$2.6 million) a year to run, according to the provincial government. In March, the province increased its resettlement offer by about C$150,000 to a range of C$250,000 and C$270,000 per household. Perry Locke is one of a handful here who wants to stay. He has a full-time job at the local electric utility, and his child is one of the two at the school. He says C$250,000 would barely cover the cost of a house elsewhere. Those wishing to stay, like Mr. Locke, argue the village has a future in tourism. They point to newly spruced-up houses where they say some Americans spend the summer. Locals say these part-time residents are against the closure, as it would end electric utility, sewage and ferry service, but they can't take part in voting. The measure needs 90% approval to be adopted. Most islanders expect it will pass. ""There is friendships and relationships been torn apart that won't be healed,"" said Mr. Locke. In July, the 48-year-old stepped down as Little Bay Islands' mayor, a decision he said he made after he had heard that some residents, wary of his opposition to the move, were questioning whether he should lead the town through its vote. According to local lore, the town was founded in 1825 by an English settler named Budgell. Dennis Budgell, the town councilor who approached the province about resettlement, said islanders often joke about this. ""Everybody says, it was a Budgell who started this place, now it's a Budgell who is going to close it down,"" he said. (END) Dow Jones Newswires February 14, 2014 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT)"
Can Japan recapture its cool? Nathan VanderKlippe reports on a $405-million bid to engineer national buzz,NL,"TOKYO -- Doraemon is a blue robot cat whose front pocket is stuffed with a seemingly endless supply of neat gadgets that he uses to help out a Tokyo fourth-grader named Noby. Forty-five years after he first appeared in a manga, or Japanese comic book, hardly anyone in this country doesn't know that Doraemon was sent back in time from the 22nd century by Noby's great-grandchildren, hoping that his good deeds would make their lives better as well. Now, the guardians of Japan's economic future are banking on much the same thing. They hope that the beloved, magical cat can reach into his bag of tricks and pull out a ticket to the global spotlight, both for himself and for the nation that created him. Although appointed Japan's “anime ambassador” in 2008, Doraemon didn't speak English until a few months ago. Then, as part of a sweeping effort to rekindle Japanese domination of international pop culture, his new ebook series made its U.S. debut on amazon.com. The government has created the $405-million “Cool Japan Fund,” a blatant attempt to reclaim the country's lost status as a global trendsetter, just as “Cool Britannia” rose from the ashes of the Swinging Sixties three decades later. Officials want exports of cultural products such as Doraemon to reach $100-billion by 2020, which is when the Summer Olympics come to Tokyo. It won't be an easy feat. Five years ago, such exports were worth barely half that much. And, besides, is cool even something that a country can manufacture? In 2010, Japan lost its place as the world's second-largest economy to China. A year later, its global image was tarnished by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in many ways the country's optimist-in-chief, has launched a campaign to tell the world that “Japan is back.” This week the outspoken and often controversial populist marked National Foundation Day by saying he is determined to see the country “go forward as a Japan that has pride.” He also reminded the public it has an obligation to hand down both “peace and prosperity” to the next generation. With the 2020 Games on the horizon, his government is certainly trying to turn things around. Since returning to power just over a year ago, Mr. Abe has committed at least 10 trillion yen ($107-billion) to stimulate growth in an economy that has suffered from deflation since 1998, the last time the Olympics came to Japan, at Nagano . Pouring all that fuel on the economy has had a dramatic effect. After years of declining salaries and prospects, the stock market has been roaring, unemployment is at a six-year low and optimism is staging a comeback. Brand Japan, however, is not. Not only did Fukushima strike at the very heart of the nation's reputation for technological sophistication and savvy, international sales of manga are plummeting (down 35 per cent in the United States alone), and J-pop has given way to K-pop and such Korean mega hits as Gangnam Style. It has been little more than a decade since an article in Foreign Policy magazine entitled “Japan's Gross National Cool” noted Japan's sudden prominence on the global stage. Sony PlayStation and Nintendo gaming consoles, along with other high-tech wonders, were spreading into the world's living rooms. International manga sales were on a rocket ride, anime techniques being mimicked in Hollywood, and The New York Times had declared Tokyo “the real international capital of fashion.” All of which prompted Foreign Policy to conclude that “Japan's growing cultural presence has created a mighty engine of national cool.” The world saw Japanese styles and literature, and went crazy. But the designers and writers who were responsible were not, by and large, seeking such adulation – some were even uncomfortable with the notion of being “cool.” It just sort of happened. Rebels versus the mainstream Just as suddenly it fell apart. Last month, Nintendo, which once had a per-employee profit higher than that of Wall Street money-spinner Goldman Sachs, forecast an annual loss of $270-million. At the same time, Japan increasingly has no choice but to look abroad for consumers – its own are dying off. Last year, the world's oldest population (almost one-quarter of the 127 million citizens are over 65) shrank by 244,000, or 0.2 per cent, the largest decline on record. At this rate, the population will be one-third smaller in 50 years. New buyers are essential, even if they have to be bought. Coolness, however, is an elusive commodity. U.S. marketing expert Caleb Miller, who wrote his 2010 doctoral thesis on the subject, says that it originates outside the mainstream. In fact, he writes, “my studies suggest that people and brands can become cool by displaying ‘bounded autonomy' – which is typically inferred from displays of rebellion and uniqueness.” Not exactly how Japan is trying to recapture the magic. The comeback bid has its headquarters high in an office tower in Tokyo's swank Roppongi Hills development. Visitors are greeted by jangling music, five screens showing a slow-moving panorama of the highlands near Nagano and a stainless-steel floor that vibrates with the bass tones. It's all meant to envelop the senses, to surround the visitor with a new vision of the nation. Everything about Cool Japan, from the ultra-modern furniture (made in Japan, of course), to its overseers (executives drawn from television, fashion and gaming), to its giant money pot (supplied by corporations as well as government) is part of an ambitious attempt to reshape how a famously insular culture works. The fund's first request for proposals sparked a deluge: nearly 100 proposals, seeking nearly 10 times the money that's available. “One of our models is Hollywood, the other is Disney,” says co-chief operating officer Masaki Koito. “They produce content with the global market in mind, and they have distribution channels all over the world. “We believe that, for Japanese content, we need a more scientific business method.” Think a new push to sell the world everything from ramen and rice to fruit and convenience-store pouches of curry, as well as win back audiences for manga and anime. Then think of the deeper efforts required to do all that: hiring translators to give the world access to a large body of existing literature; paying lawyers to negotiate content rights and buy up TV time around the world; finding logistics experts to build new “cold chains” to deliver that fruit unspoiled. With additional government money on the way (the $405-million is expected to more than double), Cool Japan has mulled investing overseas in Japan-centric shopping malls and food courts, while closer to home, it tries to breathe new life into old hits. Enter Doraemon. Until recently, not one of the 12,500 pages occupied by the blue cat's story had been published in English. But over the past year, a small group of translators has prepared the entire Doraemon catalogue for a new audience. The first issue was published as a digital Kindle book in November, in part thanks to the efforts of Matt Alt, a Tokyo translator with a broad knowledge of manga culture. For Japan, he says, products like Doraemon are a bit like an untapped oil and gas reservoir – immensely valuable, and just waiting to be exploited. But taking the plunge isn't always easy, according to Yoshiaki Koga, a senior deputy director of publishing giant Kodansha. “Readership will shrink in Japan, so we have to look overseas … We all know this is the reality. But we still find it tough to make the huge investment.” He speaks from experience. From 1968 to 1971, Japanese television audiences sat enthralled by another comic-book story, this one about a young baseball pitcher whose dreams of greatness come true partly because he has pitches with magical properties. Star of the Giants played out over 182 episodes so popular that some were shown in theatres; four decades later, middle-aged Japanese men can still describe its plot and characters vividly. Low-rent remakes In 2010, Mr. Koga had an idea: Why not remake Star of the Giants for India and adapt the story line to cricket? After all, he says, “baseball's origins are in cricket.” It was a bold move. Kodansha had never animated for a foreign audience, but eventually agreed to 26 episodes. A company in Hyderabad was recruited for the animation, and the main character given a new backstory that included growing up in the slums of Mumbai. It was done on the cheap, eschewing 3D. “We don't need anything fancy like Pixar for Indian people,” Mr. Koga says. But no channel in India's vast television universe wanted to bet on Suraj – The Rising Star, as the story was called, so Kodansha had to buy air time instead. Worse, merchandise sales, the real source of potential profit, haven't taken off. “We still haven't recovered all of our investment,” Mr. Koga acknowledges (even in Japan, that can take three years). “India, even though they have a huge population, it's not like you can get overnight success.” Still, Kodansha is considering a followup, and Mr. Koga, eager to try again, wants to move to India to shepherd operations himself. “We have to try something new,” he says. “We have to challenge ourselves.” Japan is hardly the first country to attempt what the marketers call “national branding.” In fact, the reigning champion isn't too far away. In the mid-1990s, Chinese state television helped to unleash the “Korean Wave” when it began to air television dramas from South Korea, which by 2011 was exporting about $155-million (U.S.) worth of programming to Iran, Iraq and Japan as well as China. The wave now goes far beyond TV (even Japan has developed an appetite for kimchi, and Gangnam Style has the world begging for K-pop), and thrives on mountains of public money. Created in 2001, the government-run Korean Culture and Content Agency spent $330-million last year alone on promoting pop culture overseas. In many ways, Seoul is now Asia's capital of cool. But the government didn't create that cool; it seized on a trend already in progress, just as Britain had a decade earlier. Whitehall set out to rebrand the country long after reading about “Cool Britannia” in Newsweek – and discovered the peril in entrusting such things to bureaucrats. “Nothing is sadder than trying too hard to be cool,” The Economist observed of the British attempt, whose tactics included putting Union Jack mini-skirts on The Spice Girls. And, of course, cool isn't forever. Thirteen years after his 1996 Newsweek cover story declared London “the coolest city on the planet,” writer Stryker McGuire returned with an obituary: “The Blair era is long gone, and so too is the national spirit, the hope and the optimism, that reigned in those days.” “The government forgot it was trying to promote Britain,” lamented policy adviser Simon Anholt, who has made a career of reviving images, “and started promoting the campaign to promote Britain.” Seoul's investment paid off Korea, however, offers Japan some hope. The return on its investment in cultural promotion has been staggering. In 2002, Korean Wave exports were about $500-million (U.S.). A decade later: $10-billion, which Seoul says could hit $57-billion by 2020. Still, Noel O'Dea, head of the St. John's marketing firm responsible for Newfoundland and Labrador's award-winning tourism ads, isn't so sure. “Most places try to be like Disneyland,” he says. “They try to follow what other countries, places, products, services have been doing that seems successful.” It doesn't work. Branding can be powerful, but there has to be a story to tell. “There are truths,” Mr. O'Dea says, “and the truths should start with the DNA of the country.” Which raises a difficult question: Is Japan, in fact, still cool? To some, the answer is a qualified yes. Ian Condry, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has organized the MIT/Harvard Cool Japan Research Project – a series of seminars and arts events – since 2006. “The Japanese pop-culture boom may seem less visible now,” he explains, and yet North American audiences “at things like anime conventions are roughly double what they were a decade ago.” Others worry that Japan has become so culturally fragmented that its allure to the outside world is much diminished. Manga is increasingly inwardly-focused and self-referential, rendering it opaque to all but those with a lifetime obsession. In an online essay, Tokyo writer and musician David W. Marx observes that trends such as the otaku (geek) and gyaru (“gal”) cultures have become powerful forces, attracting an upwelling of niche fashion and literature. But unlike, say, Mario or Hello Kitty, neither has the kind of mainstream appeal that might make them globally significant. “Japanese companies now face a true crisis,” Mr. Marx writes. “Appealing to the most powerful consumers in Japan will lead them away from tastes and values that can be easily exported overseas.” Matt Alt, the Doraemon translator, is an unapologetic believer in Japan's ability to reverse course, noting that it was only a few decades after the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that Japanese electronics were lusted after by the world. “There's so much vitality here in this city,” he says. “And Japan is absolutely a comeback king.” But some of Cool Japan's early returns aren't promising. Nancy Snow, who is writing a book on Japan's post-Fukushima brand image, attended the agency's launch party and shook her head in disbelief at who was in the crowd: older men in suits “who really aren't tapped into the trends in Japan, and what the youth are interested in.” Also, argues the professor of communications at California State University, the campaign's priorities – food, manga, anime, fashion – are hardly cutting-edge. “They're conservative and they're uncreative.” Or worse. Ms. Snow points to the appointment of pop-culture follower Danny Choo last year to a high-profile committee on “creative industries internationalization” that advises the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Out of touch, out of luck? British-born and now based in Tokyo, Mr. Choo is the creator of Mirai Suenaga, a doe-eyed and enormously busty robotic doll. She has realistic nipples and, as Ms. Snow says, offers “a cute reaction when she is given a pat.” Mirai Suenaga serves as the mascot for Culture Japan, Mr. Choo's weekly TV show, and is so popular that her image has appeared on aircraft. But to Ms. Snow, the character illustrates just how out of step Japan is with the rest of the world. “They're porn-style dolls,” she says, adding that, upon first seeing Mirai, she thought: “Are they really that out of touch that they can't see how offensive these images are?” Rather than spending hundreds of millions in a desperate, possibly misguided attempt to make itself cool again, she concludes, “what Japan has to do is really open itself up more.” If Doraemon is such a cool cat, maybe he has a gadget that does just that.

BoC Governor: Rates to Stay Low as Most of Canada in 'Postcrisis Repair' Mode -- Globe & Mail,NL,"(From Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper, April 25 edition.) By BARRIE McKENNA Of THE GLOBE AND MAIL TORONTO (Globe and Mail)--Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz's prediction of an unusually plodding recovery is rooted in what he calls a ""hot-and-not"" economy. Resource-rich provinces and sectors are booming, while much of the rest of the country is still in the throes of a ""postcrisis repair job,"" Mr. Poloz said Thursday after a speech to a business audience in Saskatoon. That means that interest rates will stay low for longer, while inflation will remain below the central bank's 2% target for at least another two years, he forecast. Citing continuing economic weakness, the central bank held its key overnight interest rate at 1%last week, marking the 29th successive no-decision from the bank, stretching back to September, 2010. Most economists expect the bank's next move to be a rate increase--probably in the second half of next year. But Mr. Poloz told reporters the bank is sticking to ""true neutrality."" In his speech, Mr. Poloz said the resource price boom of the past decade has been more of a gift than a curse for Canada. But he acknowledged that the benefits have been spread unevenly across the country. ""While different regions and sectors adjust differently, and while these adjustments can be painful, they allow us to maximize the benefits of our rich energy endowment, and ultimately everyone gets the gift,"" he told members of the Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership. Mr. Poloz said the growing gap between the value of resource exports and import prices since 2002 means gross domestic income--a measure of the purchasing power of Canadians -- is 7% higher than it would have been. Obviously the rewards are greater in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, where wages have grown more rapidly. But ""everywhere in Canada"" is benefiting, he insisted. The price of oil over the past decade is twice what it was in the three previous decades, triggering a boom in oil sands production. Some critics have blamed the oil boom for sending the Canadian dollar soaring in the 2000s, devastating the country's manufacturing sector--a phenomenon often referred to as Dutch disease. The Canadian dollar has since fallen roughly 10 cents (U.S.) in the past year to 90.7 cents. The central bank also released a background paper Thursday that suggests the export pickup will affect non-energy exporters unevenly as the U.S. economy rebounds. Makers of machinery, building materials, aircraft, pharmaceuticals, plastics and metal products stand to gain from the lower Canadian dollar and stronger U.S. growth. Tourism will also pick up. Several other sectors will continue to struggle, including auto makers, food and beverage suppliers, and chemical manufacturers. The report found that Canada's share of the U.S. market for non-energy products has shrunk by six percentage points since 2000 to 11.4% in 2013. The report is more evidence that Canadian exporters have been losing competitive ground to other countries in the all-important U.S. market. That partly explains why the bank failed to predict the slow recovery of manufactured exports since the recession of 2008-09. But Mr. Poloz said the central bank now expects ""a gradual convergence"" between Canadian exports and growing demand in the U.S. and elsewhere. But he said more restructuring still lies ahead for the economy. ""We can't rely on forecasts in an environment where so many things have changed,"" Mr. Poloz told reporters. But he insisted that the ""ingredients"" are now in place for exports to pick up--a forecast the bank has been making for more than a year. ""We're comfortable on the sequence, but the timing has been difficult,"" he conceded. www.theglobeandmail.com[http://www.theglobeandmail.com] (END) Dow Jones Newswires April 24, 2014 21:00 ET (01:00 GMT)"
The Grand Seduction: A cynical homecoming; Taylor Kitsch returns to Canadian cinema in the English remake of Ken Scott’s 2003 Québécois blockbuster Seducing Dr. Lewis,NL,"It’s easy to regard Taylor Kitsch’s role in The Grand Seduction as an admission of defeat. There’s Kelowna, B.C.’s favourite son, star of such recent stinkers as Savages, Battleship and Disney’s box office belly-flop John Carter, returning to Canadian cinema following a disastrous tour as a would-be Hollywood heartthrob like a vanquished hero. In the first of several clever strokes, this English language remake of Ken Scott’s 2003 Québécois blockbuster Seducing Dr. Lewis, builds Kitsch’s humble homecoming into the script. Kitsch plays Dr. Paul Lewis, a cricket-loving bad boy busted with cocaine while flying out of St. John’s. The customs officer cuts the sniffling, strung-out Lewis a deal: Relocate to the sparsely populated Newfoundland harbour town of Tickle Head to serve as local physician for one month and all charges will be swept under the rug. The native Tickle Headers have grown cozy living off the dole, the fishing industry having long since departed. The only hope for the bucolic community comes in the form of a petrochemical processing facility, promising jobs and renewed prosperity. The catch: The city needs a registered physician in order to secure the contract. And so begins Tickle Head’s charm offensive, as they seduce Dr. Lewis into settling down for good. Leading the charge is Murray (Irishman Brendan Gleeson, affecting a convincing Newfoundland brogue), a townie lifer old enough to remember the bygone good ol’ days, but riled up enough to demand something more than a smooth line at the welfare office. Using old-school spy tactics, Murray tailors Tickle Head to the good doctor’s needs: bleaching the townsfolk’s pilled cable-knit sweaters white and hurrying them through a crash course in cricket, conspiring to add Lewis’s favourite Indian dish to the menu at a tiny mom-and-pop diner. During a fishing expedition, a gruff local (Gordon Pinsent) dons scuba gear and surreptitiously fits Lewis’s hook with a prize catch – previously caught, still partly frozen. When Lewis first arrives in Tickle Head, his wide-eyed, half-embarrassed disbelief at all the homespun quaintness reveals something of Kitsch’s reaction to his own cap-in-hand return to homegrown Canadian filmmaking. Ours is a cinema of charm, of abounding good intentions. Like the goodly denizens of Tickle Head baiting the doctor, Canadian cinema hustles about earnestly. It labours valiantly to win us over if not with results than with the sincerity of the attempt. Yet The Grand Seduction, for all its hominess and warm, fuzzy lensing of island life (cinematographer Douglas Koch shoots Tickle Head as if he were making a commercial for the Newfoundland and Labrador tourism board), seems largely disinterested in winning our half-hearted admiration. By and large, the film’s folksiness bucks schmaltz. The script, by Ken Scott and Michael Dowse (Fubar, Goon), is loaded with jokes that come at the expense of the islanders – particularly all the hammy cricket stuff. And director Don McKellar, best known for the hipster wit of Late Night and TV’s Twitch City, brings his urbane sensibility to the rural setting. As sweet as the film can be (a burgeoning romance between Kitsch’s doctor and Liane Balaban’s hard-to-get local borders on the adorable), The Grand Seduction is also deeply cynical. It’s as much a film about protecting the homey traditions of the harbour as one about the perils of self-preservation. Tickle Head’s salvation, after all, is the oil company, and McKellar does a fine job pitching it as a sort of toxic hope. The prospect of jobs and prosperity is tempered by greasy oil execs demanding bribes, and the sense that the corporation is pitting similarly down-and-out communities against one another. Yet here, it’s the means – the sense of renewed togetherness and community vitality – that seem to justify the dubious end. Globe and Mail Update"
A banner year for big ice off Newfoundland; Spectacular sights delight visitors as province sees the most bergs since 2003,NL,"ST. JOHN'S -- Visitors from across Canada and around the world are awestruck as their tour boat steams within view of a mammoth iceberg off Cape Spear, NL. They lined up at a pier in St. John's for their chance to view the big ice off the province in the best season for it in at least a decade. The sight of a giant glacial sculpture moored in 50 metres of water, a perfect archway carved right through it by surf and waves, does not disappoint. ""Absolutely beautiful! Never seen anything like it before,"" said Pete Kottenstette, who relocated to Mount Pearl, NL., from Dallas, Texas, as part of his work in the oil and gas sector. Jean-Pierre Renaud of Laval, Que., was equally impressed. ""It's incredible. It's just beautiful, seeing the size of it, the colours coming out of it when the sun is on it ... it's just amazing. It's breathtaking."" Prehistoric towers and slabs of ice moulded by the sea into shapes of all description have arrived to the delight of tourists as mariners take warning. ""It's phenomenal, really,"" said Capt. Barry Rogers, president of Iceberg Quest Ocean Tours as he pauses in the wheelhouse of his popular vessel from a hectic schedule. ""We've had some great ice years, but I think this one is going to be the biggest year of all. We've just had a huge flow of icebergs coming from Greenland."" The rare display of frozen natural beauty is attracting people from across the globe, Rogers said. ""They're just totally intrigued with icebergs. ""I guess it's one thing to hear about them and yet it's a totally different thing to be up within several hundred feet of them."" Rogers is careful to keep a safe distance. ""That iceberg is quite large underneath and quite dangerous as well,"" he told his guests over a microphone as he approaches the site where it ran aground near Cape Spear. It's gorgeous to look at, but can break apart or roll over with little warning, he explained. Rogers cautions passengers in the rise and fall of North Atlantic swells to hang on at all times. One hand on the camera, one hand on a safety rail, he urges them. As people crowd the bow pulpit taking photos, Rogers points out the berg's striking shades of brilliant aqua and deep blue, the grooves cut by waves and small waterfalls running from melting sections. He says it likely took around 11/2 to three years for that iceberg to arrive. Creeping glaciers that cover much of Greenland crawl towards ocean cliffs before snapping off in giant slabs that float south toward the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland. When spring sea ice is especially thick, it keeps the icebergs, believed to be at least 12,000-year-old specimens of frozen pristine pure water, more intact as they travel. They float because the density of the frozen berg is less than that of sea water. Smaller ""bergy bits"" are especially hazardous as they can be harder to see in waves, but can easily cut through a steel hull. Rogers steers toward a soaring rocky cliff to give passengers a closer look at a sparkling piece of sunlit ice less than five metres long. Such remnants are known as ""growlers"" for the hissing they make as they release air while melting. Trudy Wohlleben, a senior ice forecaster for the Canadian Ice Service, said a long trail of bergs extending down the Labrador coast is now concentrated off northeastern and eastern Newfoundland. She said it's the most sea ice and resulting bergs since 2003, although it's not clear why it is happening. ""Climate has many aspects to it,"" Wohlleben said from Ottawa. ""Whether it's natural variability or it's part of a longer-term trend, it's a little difficult to say."" It's expected that icebergs will be visible off Newfoundland for at least the next several weeks. Check out the Iceberg Finder map at icebergfinder.com for updates. A warm coat, hat and gloves are recommended for offshore viewing. For tips on travel to Newfoundland and Labrador, see newfoundlandlabrador.com"
Today in History - July 2,NL,"Today in History for July 2: Also on this date: In 311, Miltiades was elected the 32nd pope of the Catholic Church. During his pontificate, Christianity was finally tolerated by Rome, following the Emperor Constantine's conversion to the Christian faith. In 1489, Thomas Cranmer, the first Protestant Archbishop of Canterbury, was born. He was the primary author of the ``Book of Common Prayer'' and ``Thirty-Nine Articles of the Anglican Church.'' In 1566, the French astrologer Nostradamus, died. In 1808, explorer Simon Fraser reached the Pacific Ocean near what is now Vancouver. Fraser thought he had been on the Columbia River, but was actually on the river that now bears his name. In 1821, Sir Charles Tupper, Canada's sixth prime minister, was born in Amherst, Nova Scotia. He led the federal government for a few months in 1896. Tupper, who was also the first president of the Canadian Medical Association, died in 1915. In 1865, William Booth formed the Salvation Army at a meeting in London. Booth, a successful revivalist preacher, was originally in the Methodist church but had resigned because it would not let him preach. His speech at a mission in Whitechapel is considered by the Salvation Army as the date of its formation. The Army spread to Canada in 1882. In 1881, James Garfield, 20th president of the United States, was shot. He died from his wound three months later. It was just four months after his inauguration that he was shot at the Washington, D.C., railway station by Charles Guiteau, an erratic lawyer and disappointed office-seeker. In 1885, the Plains Cree Chief Big Bear surrendered at Fort Carlton, Sask. In 1900, the first rigid zeppelin airship, created by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, took flight near Lake Constance in Germany. It carried five people, reached an altitude of 396 metres and flew a distance of six kilometres in 17 minutes. In 1900, stage director and playwright Tyrone Guthrie was born in Tunbridge Wells, England. Guthrie was the founding artistic director of the Shakespearean Festival in Stratford, Ontario. He died in 1971. In 1912, five people died when the dirigible ``Alcron'' exploded over Atlantic City. In 1924, Edmonton's temperature reached 36.7 degrees Celsius, the highest in more than 100 years. In 1926, Arthur Meighen's Conservative government lost a Commons non-confidence motion by one vote. Meighen became prime minister three days earlier when MacKenzie King resigned over Governor General Lord Byng's refusal to call an election. After Meighen's defeat, Byng agreed to a Sept. 14 election, which King's Liberals won. In 1931, Peter Kurten, dubbed ``The Monster of Dusseldorf,'' died by guillotine in France for raping and killing eight women and children in a 10-month period. In 1937, American aviator Amelia Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the Pacific while attempting to circle the globe. After taking off from New Guinea and reporting by radio that they were lost and running out of fuel, the pair did not reach their destination of Howland Island and were never heard from again. In 1940, a German U-boat torpedoed the liner ``Arandora Star'' while transporting German and Italian prisoners to Canada during the Second World War. Over 750 prisoners and crew died. In 1941, the Royal Canadian Air Force was authorized to enlist women. The Canadian army and navy soon followed suit. In 1941, New York Yankees outfielder Joe DiMaggio set a major league record by hitting safely in his 45th consecutive game. DiMaggio's streak ended at 56 games on July 17. In 1961, American author Ernest Hemingway, plagued by ill health, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Idaho. He was 62. In 1962, volunteer doctors provided emergency services in Saskatchewan when most of its estimated 700 doctors went on strike to protest the province's compulsory medical plan, which went into effect the previous day. In 1968, legislation allowing for easier access to divorce in Canada went into effect. The new ``Divorce Act'' authorized the granting of divorce solely on the grounds of marriage breakdown. In 1969, the first college of veterinary medicine in Western Canada opened at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1974, Ralph Steinhauer became the first aboriginal (he was a Cree) Lieutenant-Governor in Canada, for the province of Alberta. In 1976, North and South Vietnam were officially united after 20 years of war. In 1982, using a lawn chair hoisted by 42 helium-filled weather balloons, Larry Walters took off from San Pedro, Calif. He rose to an altitude of nearly 4,900 metres and travelled 24 kilometres before landing safely in Long Beach. Aviation officials fined him $1,500. In 1984, Karl Saucek, a 37-year-old stuntman from Hamilton, survived a plunge over Niagara Falls in a lightweight metal-and-plastic barrel. In 1990, more than 1,400 Muslim pilgrims died in a stampede inside a pedestrian tunnel leading to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. In 1992, the federal government closed Newfoundland's northern cod fishery for two years to protect dwindling stocks and allow it time to recover. The moratorium, which was later extended, affected more than 19,000 fishermen and plant workers. In 1994, gunmen killed Colombian soccer player Andres Escobar, who accidentally scored a goal against his own team in the World Cup, in Medellin, Colombia. In 1997, Mr. Justice Gilles Letourneau released his Somalia public inquiry report that denounced the highest levels of Canada's military leadership. It said military leaders tried to cover up the death of a civilian in March of 1993, lied to the commission and may have broken the law to hide the truth about the Somalia affair. In 1997, screen legend Jimmy Stewart -- star of such movies as ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and ``The Philadelphia Story'' -- died at his California home at age 89. In 1998, officials in Paris re-lit the eternal flame under the Arc de Triomphe. The flame, commemorating France's war dead, was extinguished the previous day by two drunken Mexican tourists who used it as a urinal.

In 2002, American multi-millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett became the first to circle the world solo in a balloon, travelling more than 31,000 kilometres. He started June 19 from Northam, Western Australia and landed in the Outback, 1,400 kilometres northwest of Sydney. In 2003, a provincial royal commission report said that the federal government must work with Newfoundland and Labrador to improve the state of the fisheries and ensure more benefits from offshore oil and gas. The report focused on the devastation of a once-lucrative fishery, the out-migration of 70,000 people in the previous decade and double-digit unemployment in each of the last 30 years. It concluded that Newfoundlanders were not interested in separation, but wanted to see a more effective working relationship with Canada. In 2003, Vancouver won the right to host the 2010 Winter Olympics ahead of Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea. In 2003, the second outbreak of SARS in Toronto was declared over by the World Health Organization. In 2010, an explosion tore through a Canadian Forces recruitment centre in Trois-Rivieres, Que., in the early morning. There were no injuries. ``Resistance internationaliste'' claimed responsibility. In 2010, an F3 tornado destroyed more than a dozen homes in Raymore, Sask., and on the Kawacatoose First Nation. No one died. Environment Canada said the twister was about 500 metres wide, cut a path 45 kilometres long and may have been on the ground for as long as one hour. In 2010, a tanker truck hauling fuel on a rural eastern Congo highway overturned and exploded in a massive fireball that killed at least 242 people. Many of the dead were villagers who had descended on the truck to siphon fuel illegally from the wreckage. (The Canadian Press)"
The kind of Canada we'd like to be,NL,"Looking abroad we see many countries faring worse than Canada, yet we have much to complain about and can do so without fear of reprisal. Even so, we must not brag about it because we need humility to make our country even better. Narrowing the income gap would be a great start, as would enhancing supports for the young, elderly, and least able to help themselves. Minding our precious environment while sharing fairly in Canada’s natural wealth would be magnificent; as would welcoming more refugees from troubled lands to continue enriching our population. Investing in health and education so that everyone may live in community, regardless of disability, would be awe-inspiring; as would practicing inclusion in all aspects of life — in school, work and play. And adopting an electoral model that is more representative would be a profound improvement. Only by striving to become a land of opportunity and prosperity in which everyone participates, without exception, can we be as great as we dare to imagine. I want to see a vibrant Canada where everyone belongs, and each of us plays an active part. Salvatore (Sal) Amenta, Stouffville I would like to see a Canada where our politicians actually care about the working poor, and the unemployed; where our politicians answer questions that are put to them instead of talking a lot but not coming up with an answer; where our politicians tell the truth about the effect of free trade deals on Canada and about environmental destruction caused by pipelines; where politicians can really be trusted; and where government spends money on public health care, public education and low rent housing, rather than throwing billions of dollars away on military aircraft, and then telling us there is no money available for the CBC, the post office and other important services Canadians rely on. Bob Abrahams, Nelson, B.C. I would like to see a Canada that is an example to the world in the way it treats its citizens. I would like to see a country where nobody is living in the streets or in poor circumstances, a country where there is guaranteed annual income and a pension plan that satisfies everyone. I would like to see a country that puts money into transit and rail and gets people out of their cars, that has a much more open immigration policy than what we have. I would like to see a Canada that develops its natural resources in a responsible and sustainable way, with a humane foreign policy and not selective on human rights and does not participate in the invasion of foreign countries. I would like to see a country where the prime minister feels comfortable marching in the annual pride parade, which represents diversity and tolerance in all its forms. Canada could be the greatest country in the world and set an example if it uses its vast resources for the common good of its people. Andrew van Velzen, Toronto I believe that the best thing we can do for Canada is to stop the tyranny of the minority, which our first-past-the-post electoral system enables. Today, as a result of a right-wing government elected by less than 40 per cent of the electorate, Canada has become a shadow if its former self. Fully two-thirds of Canadians are fair-minded and progressive and express a firm desire to work for the betterment of fellow citizens and, indeed, of the peoples of the world. Once we have proper, proportional representation where every vote counts, the Canada that most of us want will follow. Jonathan O’Mara, Whitby I want to thank Canada for giving my children and me the opportunity to be our best, to thrive, and prosper. I want to see a Canada that is strong, free, and where there is unity amongst diversity. It would be a dull world if we were all the same. Variety is the spice of life. I also want a Canada where utmost attention is paid to the sphere of education. Education is the manifestation of the perfection that is already in man. The institution of learning is a sanctified institution, where the energy of youngsters is utilized for constructive purpose and for the enhancement of human civilization. So I hope and pray that Canada remains a country where freedom rains, where the rights of citizens is preserved, where importance continues to be given to the facet of education and health. Myra Ahmed, Markham I would like to borrow words from the Beta Sigma Phi pledge: “More tolerance for our fellow beings through a better understanding of them, a clearer and deeper appreciation of the cultural and finer things of life for ourselves and a determination to give the best that is in us . . . and to assist in any and every way to shed the light of our torch throughout the world.” Our Canada in 2014 should be a beacon to the world. Let us aspire for lofty goals and leave the small-minded partisanship and bickering behind. Jo Erickson, Uxbridge A Plea for my Country “Canada is our mountain fastness, Canada is our undulant hills, Canada is our thundering seas, Canada is our tundras and towns Canada is our forests and farms Canada is our forests and fields Canada is our souls Canada is sovereign Canada is where we stand Canada Our line in the sand. Canada. We want it back.” Sylvia Ray, Burlington My Canada used to be a united, strong and open democracy. It was a place where diversity was celebrated and we were thought of as peacekeepers. I was proud to wear my Canadian flag while in other countries and was treated with such esteem because I was from Canada. This has changed. Now I do not recognize my Canada and I want it back. The Harper Conservatives have been working to destroy everything that made this a place of fairness for all and where forward, creative thinkers were given a respected voice. We should be celebrating our Native population, our scientists,our beautiful landscape, our innovators. Instead we are living in a climate that is mean-spirited, that divides provinces, that rules on ideology, and uses our money for show and advertising instead of helping our people. One in which fear is used as a tool for the Conservatives to stay in power and that blames instead of offering solutions. On this Canada day while I reflect back, I am optimistic that our once great country will reach its true potential again after the next election. Sherry Kornelsen, Windsor From sea to shiny sea Canada is blessed with natural beauty, natural resources and diverse ethnic cultures enriching our Canadian landscape. On the economic side, our growth is the envy of the G-8 group of nations, and our health system and social security net are among the best in the world. But as the cliché goes “We cannot rest on our laurels.” 1. In a land of plenty, obesity lurks. Forty per cent of our children are obese and most of these kids will grow up battling diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. It’s imperative that we introduce courses in nutrition and healthy foods in our schools 2. A natural follow up to heathy eating is exercise. More bicycle-friendly roads. For far too long our roadways have been clogged with automobiles leading to traffic gridlock, pollution and global warming. If mass transit is the way to the future then these eco-friendly vehicles can be a worthy supplement in providing a cleaner environment. And, besides, the health benefits are almost unlimited. So it’s time we Canadians unbuckle our seatbelts and try some pedal power for a change . . . puff, puff, puff? Hmm. 3. Senior citizens should get a break on hydro rates and property taxes. And free local transport within our city limits during off-peak hours as is being done in some European cities. 4. And lastly with regard to our first nations, Grand chief Derek Nepinak of Manitoiba said, “We are treated poorly and we need to do something about it.” I think lots needs to be done in terms of child care, education and land rights. After all, doesn’t charity begin at home? Max Desouza, Toronto Canadians are a proud and principled people who are currently gripped by a malaise brought on by an arrogant, unresponsive, self-serving government. We need to believe that all levels of government have the interests of the Canadian citizen first and foremost in their minds. Herewith are some suggestions to bring us closer to that ideal: <bullet>Blend public and Catholic school systems to eliminate costly duplication of services. Religious services can be held outside of school hours — not during instructional hours, as is the current practice. Catholic students are forced to take religion classes each year, thus depriving them of the opportunity of taking academic credits they might otherwise choose. This places them at a disadvantage compared to public school graduates. <bullet>Eliminate the private use of publicly owned vehicles from every level of government, thus saving millions of litres of fuel annually. All vehicles purchased for all levels of government must be the smallest, most fuel-efficient that can safely perform their intended function. <bullet>Eliminate all subsidized meal, coffee, party funds from all levels of public offices from school boards to municipal, provincial and federal offices. Taxpayers should not have to pay for donuts and beverages for people who earn enough to pay for their own treats. <bullet>Formulate legislation to punish fraud and misappropriation of public funds as a criminal act. <bullet>Cap all government pensions at $50,000. Having earned excellent working salaries, no one needs more than that in retirement. <bullet>Eliminate bonuses and performance payments from all public employee contracts at every level. The salaries are more than adequate. <bullet>Any religious groups that deny women full equality with men should have their tax-exempt status revoked. This inequality is a clear violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. <bullet>The purchase of any and all energy-efficient appliances, cars, and home renovations should be made 100 per cent tax deductible. <bullet>Redesign all public-assistance programs to ensure that they are temporary safety nets, not permanent lifestyle choices. <bullet>Severely restrict commercial and residential development of our best farmland and encourage year-round hydroponics to help offset importation of seasonal foods. Bob D’Amico, St. Catharines I moved to Toronto 40 years ago. Toronto was then a beautiful city. The streets were immaculately clean. There were no homeless people. Roads and infrastructure were very good. Traffic was easy. The subway was a pleasure to ride in. After going on a trip abroad or to the U.S., I could immediately tell when I was back in Toronto. The difference was stark. Toronto has crumbled significantly since then. When I come back from a trip to Mexico or the Philippines, there is really not much difference between what I see there and here in Toronto. I would like to see a Toronto akin to its golden era of the 1970s. And no one can tell me this is not possible. Toronto is a very rich city. But since the late 1980s, we have been brainwashed with the idea that taxes are bad, taxes are high and should be cut and the mantra of cut, cut, cut taxes. Taxes are not bad. They are the price we pay for a civilized society. They provide the revenue that can make our city great again. So enough of this mantra of cut, cut, cut taxes. I would be happy to pay higher taxes to have a city that would be a wonderful place to live in for rich and poor alike. Then we can have a Toronto that is grander still than the Toronto of the 1970s. When I moved here, I thought Canada was the greatest place to live in. Canada is a good place but as I learned more of its history and its dark secret, I don’t feel as good about Canada and being Canadian as I did then. That dark secret is our treatment of the original people of this land, the First Nations, our indigenous people. They were badly mistreated and continue to be mistreated. This has to stop. Furthermore, in this day and age when climate change is so obvious and we need to do something about it, we can learn so much from our First Nations. They treat the land as something sacred, something to be respected while we, the settlers, have ravaged this land. White Canada’s goal has been to take the Indian out of the Indian. Perhaps, it is time to put the Indian in us the settlers. Then we will be able make the change needed for humans to survive in this planet. Alberto Sarthou, Toronto Majority governments with about 39 per cent of the vote: Conservative in Canada and Liberal in Ontario. Some 61 per cent of the voters voted against these governments. Only about half of the eligible voters voted. My kind of Canada deserves a true democracy. We can’t get there with our present first past the post electoral system: a vote for a losing candidate is a vote wasted. But we can get there with a ranked ballot or single transferable vote or proportional representation system. These are easy to implement. Then, every vote counts, and many more people will vote. This wonderful country deserves a true democracy. John Goodings, North York Coast to coast, Canada is gorgeous. We have a versatile/vibrant multicultural population to match our natural wonders. So, I am continuously amazed at how many Canadians have travelled abroad without ever visiting their own country. Oceans embrace each coast. Spectacular mountains grace Alberta and B.C. Wide open spaces in Manitoba and Saskatchewan showcase the skies. Our northern territories impress in their unspoiled grandeur. We are blessed with the natural and varied beauty of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, P.E.I., New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. Plus, these eastern provinces feature historical buildings/monuments exhibiting who and what made Canada. Tucked in our villages/towns/cities, is a citizenry prepared to showcase its memorable sites and attractions illuminating what made/makes Canada great. Most of these sites are managed by either city, provincial or federal governments using the principle of increasing admissions to increase revenue. Yet year to year, fewer of us visit these noteworthy attractions. Could it be that admissions have skyrocket so families can no longer afford to come? Businesses utilize either of two economic principles to increase revenue: sell more for less (Walmart, Costco) or sell less for more (Holt Renfrew, Saks Fifth Avenue). Since, more families are experiencing budget restraints, wouldn’t it be wise to adapt the principle of offering “more for less”? I suggest that admission to zoos, art galleries, museums and national parks be substantially reduced to afford year-round multiple visits by local residents. We then would not be so dependent on making our money from foreign tourists in the short summer vacation season. Plus, the added benefit of having an appreciative and knowledgeable Canadian citizenry. Dina Moyal, Innisfil I would like to see the kind of Canada it would be when it has become a truly blended society, where the principles of social equality for all are always present; where the laws, rules, and regulations are intensively made to protect its citizens and not to control them. Can we imagine what our country would be like if centuries ago our Native peoples would have truly blended with their English arrivals and explored and developed together the country we now know as Canada; and also the earliest immigrated French population had not segregated themselves from their English arrivals and joined together with them in future explorations and developments of the country we now know as Canada, a country where all our elected politicians put their country’s eternal progress ahead of their own personal gain and notoriety? Richard Miller, Kingston I visualize a Canada that can be a model for world peace and socio-economic development. Canada does an outstanding job of attracting immigrants and refugees from the far corners of the world. But its role in harnessing their skills and connections is less than stellar. Imagine if the connections of even half of newcomers are used to boost trade with the countries of their origin. Or to get students interested in applying to post-secondary institutions in Canada. Or if their skills are integrated into business and agriculture. Or if their arts, dance and music talents are exported around the world. Canada can and should develop into an exporting nation far beyond the confines of North America and Western Europe. Canada can also be a model for world peace. People from different cultures and locations live here in a spirit of friendship and goodwill. This model needs to be re-applied in countries bedevilled by dispute and conflict. By creating its own peace/volunteer corps, citizens can serve to promote peace in troubled spots. In these ways, Canada can emerge as a role model for other nations. Alan Rego, Toronto The Canada I would like to see is much like the one I already live in. Compared with many countries, it is fairer and safer for most people, offers opportunities to live well and resolves conflicts in a kinder, gentler manner. What concerns me is the growing carelessness with which we treat our environment. Not that we shouldn’t develop and exploit it wisely, but we need to stop wasting our heritage and stop needlessly imposing risks and debts on ourselves and our children. One thing I believe would help is the following simple constitutional change. Whoever uses, accesses or exploits Canada’s air, land and water must divulge, in advance, what they are doing, where they are doing it, what they are adding or taking away, and how they are preventing damage and harm. In other words, no one may put people or the environment at risk by secretly using fertilizer, pesticides or fracking fluid, or harvesting fish, wood or bitumen, or transporting gas, oil or chemicals. It won’t fix everything but it will halt the creeping compromise of our common heritage by malicious, cynical or simply careless people and corporations. Paul Collier, Toronto Canada is the pre-eminent country in the world. Most other industrialized nations don’t give their citizens as much rights. And most European countries are far behind when it comes to minority, women’s, gay, and religious rights of their populace. They still harbour xenophobia. If corporations can somehow pitch in and fund post-secondary education, I believe our home and native land will be unstoppable on the world stage. We should also reinstate Grade 13. Too much knowledge is being compressed into the present 12 grades. In public schools all religions should be taught for one year, etiquette too, feminist theory, and make French mandatory from JK to grade 13. Our laws need an overhaul. Laws are weighted unfairly to the perpetrators. I think politicians would see things differently should they be victims of heinous crimes. And make it mandatory for ISPs to turn over locations of those suspected of cyberbullying or distributing child pornography online. Our children are the most precious things we have. And keep our guns laws strict. I truly believe Canada is the last remaining utopia on earth. Happy 147th Birthday Canada — you’re a gorgeous and blessed country. Michael Persaud, Toronto I believe most of us in a moment of inattention have accidently bumped a fellow Canadian and then been surprised to hear the blameless person graciously say, “I’m sorry.” Such chance encounters never fail to remind me how lucky I am to live in this country. Common courtesy breaks down barriers and builds bridges. The politicians in Ottawa should put away their petty partisanship and work together cooperatively. A democracy can only reach its full potential if all citizens are given polite compassionate respect. Canada has the untapped potential to inspire the whole world by setting a good example. Let’s get on with it! Lloyd Atkins, Vernon, B.C. The Canada that I want to see is one in which all those who have settled here take a stance against all forms of injustice and oppression. Canada comes from the aboriginal term “kanata” yet there is an entire generation of Canadians who have turned a blind eye to those who were here before we were, and by “we” I refer to the colonialists and all those who have come after. Let us not forget that “kanata” refers to a settlement or village, and in our global community, Canada can be that village where one does not control the other, and all humans have the opportunity to exercise their creative will for the betterment of the society in which they live. That will be my Canada, the true North strong and free (for all). Yaseen Zubairi, Toronto"
*Macquarie Infrastructure Company Announces Signing Of Agreement To Acquire Remainder Of International-Matex Tank Terminals >MIC,NL,"7 Jul 2014 16:18 ET Press Release: Macquarie Infrastructure Company Announces Signing of Agreement to Acquire Remainder of International-Matex Tank Terminals Macquarie Infrastructure Company Announces Signing of Agreement to Acquire Remainder of International-Matex Tank Terminals    -- 50% interest owned by founding family to be acquired for $1.025 billion       in cash and stock at 10.7 times trailing EV/EBITDA multiple     -- Transaction expected to be accretive to Free Cash Flow per share in 2014       and thereafter     -- July 2014 close expected, MIC to focus on growth of IMTT     -- MIC increases quarterly cash dividend to $0.95 per share for second       quarter of 2014 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 07, 2014--  Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (the ""Company"" or ""MIC"") (NYSE: MIC) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire the 50% of International-Matex Tank Terminals, or IMTT, it does not currently own. Under the terms of the agreement, MIC will purchase the remainder interest from members of the business' founding family for $910.0 million in cash and $115.0 million in stock. MIC acquired its initial 50% stake in IMTT in May of 2006. The announced terms imply an enterprise value for IMTT of 10.7 times the business' trailing twelve month EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) to March 31, 2014 of $279.6 million. ""Our acquisition of the remainder of IMTT represents a unique, strategic opportunity for investors, customers and employees of IMTT,"" said James Hooke, chief executive officer of MIC. ""We believe the acquisition will deliver dividend growth for shareholders of MIC and to further enhance our ability to drive operational improvement and growth investments at IMTT. In addition, we expect the acquisition will fortify MIC's stable, largely contracted revenue based business model."" MIC expects the acquisition to be accretive to its Free Cash Flow per share in 2014. The Company now expects its underlying 2014 Free Cash Flow -- excluding transaction-related expenses - to be approximately $4.55 per share, or 11.2% higher than in 2013. The accretion reflects the increased contribution from IMTT in the future, partially offset by the dilution associated with the new shares to be issued in connection with the acquisition and the crystallization of federal income taxes payable by IMTT for the first and second quarters of 2014. As the Company does not expect the transaction to close before late July, the accretion represents only a partial year benefit of 100% ownership of IMTT. In connection with the announcement, MIC has also introduced guidance for underlying Free Cash Flow in 2015 of $5.10 per share. If both the 2014 and 2015 Free Cash Flow figures are achieved, the year on year growth in 2015 will be approximately 12.1%. MIC has grown Free Cash Flow per share by 12.3%, on average, each year since 2007. MIC intends to distribute the majority of the Free Cash Flow generated by its businesses, including IMTT, to investors in the form of a quarterly cash dividend. The Company has indicated that it would target a payout of between 80% and 85% of the Free Cash Flow, subject to the continued stable performance of its businesses and prevailing economic conditions. With the signing of the acquisition agreement, the MIC board has authorized an increase in the Company's quarterly cash dividend. The dividend payable for the second quarter of 2014 will be $0.95 per share, or $3.80 annualized, up 1.3% from the dividend paid for the first quarter of 2014. The increased dividend will be payable on August 14, 2014 to shareholders of record on August 11, 2014. MIC management expect that the MIC board will review the dividend again after the transaction has been completed and integrated. The anticipated accretion takes into consideration the proposed funding of the acquisition of IMTT using $115.0 million of new shares to be issued to the sellers, new shares and convertible senior notes expected to be issued to the public, and cash on hand. The Company said that it is also putting in place a $250.0 million revolving credit facility at the MIC holding company level that will provide it with additional liquidity and financial flexibility. The availability of the new facility is conditioned on the completion of the acquisition. Assuming the revolving credit facility is undrawn at closing, MIC has indicated that pro forma for the transaction its leverage ratio is expected to be under 4.00 times net debt to EBITDA (excluding its CP&E; segment). At the end of the first quarter in 2014 the Company reported a proportionately combined leverage ratio of 3.23 times (excluding its CP&E; segment and holding company cash held in relation to the then pending acquisition of Galaxy Aviation). Proportionately combined measures reflect the financial results of MIC's businesses and investments combined in proportion to MIC's equity in each. Rationale and Strategy Since investing in IMTT in early 2006, MIC has seen EBITDA generated by IMTT increase from approximately $67.0 million in 2005 to $279.6 million for the trailing twelve month period ended March 31, 2014. The growth in EBITDA has been a function of both pricing power and deployment of capital in growth projects at the business. MIC has participated in the development of approximately $800.0 million worth of growth projects to date and sees opportunity to promote additional growth in the future. ""We're acquiring a business that we know from our involvement with it over the past eight years and, more importantly, a business with a strong foundation built over many years of stewardship on the part of the Coleman family,"" Hooke added. ""We look forward to working with IMTT to accelerate its growth in part through increasing the amount of growth capital deployed into new projects."" In addition to deploying growth capital in the business, Hooke expects to implement expense management strategies at IMTT similar to those in place at MIC's other businesses. ""We believe that there are a number of opportunities at IMTT to implement better controls and processes, particularly as they relate to expense management and maintenance capital expenditures,"" he said. Hooke also noted the potential for IMTT to benefit from MIC's consolidated procurement capability on a number of fronts including insurance. MIC does not plan to make a large number of changes in personnel, rather the Company said that it will fill vacancies resulting from retirements and add selectively to the IMTT staff. Among the expected changes are the retirement of Thomas Coleman, current chief executive officer of IMTT, James Coleman, chairman, and James O. Coleman, head of government relations, each of whom are members of the founding family. Hooke will initially act as the CEO of IMTT in addition to his role as CEO of MIC. Macquarie's IMTT asset director, James May, will become the CFO at IMTT. Both Hooke and May have served on the IMTT board of directors for the past 5 years. May will be assisted by an additional Macquarie secondee who will head up an expanded financial planning and analysis function at IMTT. John Siragusa, IMTT's current CFO, will assume the role of chief banking officer. Richard Courtney, IMTT's president and chief operating officer will continue in his role. Both Courtney and May will report directly to Hooke. In connection with the transaction, a $20 million contribution to IMTT's defined benefit pension plan will be made. The transaction will allow MIC to consolidate IMTT's results for financial reporting and tax purposes. Pro forma for the acquisition, IMTT is expected to generate approximately 57.9% of MIC's consolidated EBITDA, excluding the contribution from businesses in its Contracted Power & Energy segment. Of the EBITDA generated by IMTT, approximately 84% is a product of firm commitments (contracted sources). In addition to increasing the clarity of MIC's financial reporting overall, consolidation will result in the elimination of a double layer of taxation. As a stand alone entity, IMTT will no longer pay federal taxes and MIC will no longer pay tax on the portion of distributions received from IMTT in excess of the federal Dividends Received Deduction amount. In addition, the transaction will permit MIC to apply existing federal net operating loss carryforwards to taxable income generated by IMTT. However, the transaction will result in the crystallization of IMTT's federal and state income tax liabilities for 2014 through the date of closing of the transaction. Per the terms of the purchase agreement, MIC will not be permitted to effect structural changes at IMTT, for example conversion of the business to a Master Limited Partnership, for a period of one year following the closing of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close as soon as practical following the conclusion of the capital raising and is subject to satisfaction of conditions including receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Summary of Transaction Benefits MIC believes that the proposed acquisition of the remaining interest in IMTT not currently owned by the Company provides shareholders with a number of potentially significant benefits, including:     -- an opportunity to improve operations, business development, commercial       and support capabilities at IMTT;     -- a simplification of the MIC structure and financial reporting;     -- elimination of a double layer of taxation;     -- ability to offset future taxable income at IMTT with MIC NOLs;     -- improved efficiency in allocation of capital to growth opportunities;     -- better visibility into growth in distributable cash flow; and,     -- enhanced dividend growth.

House Hunting in ...Newfoundland,NL,"A WATERFRONT CHALET-STYLE LOG CABIN IN NEWFOUNDLAND $1.19 MILLION (1,275,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS) Built into a hill overlooking an evergreen-fringed pond in Newfoundland, Canada, this house, with four bedrooms and two-and-a-half bathrooms, was built of massive pine logs imported from the nearby province of Nova Scotia. About seven years old, it has a chalet style, with a river-stone exterior on the first floor and a veranda spanning the entire second floor, along with a screened-in porch. The interior of the 3,409-square-foot house has soaring 20-foot ceilings, oversize windows and more than 100 recessed lights. The main entrance is on the second floor and opens to a burgundy-painted foyer with an elevator to the left. Beyond the foyer is a great room with a towering wood-burning fireplace of stone with a pine-log mantle, a wet bar with granite countertops and a door to the veranda. The home has mostly hardwood floors. An enormous arch cut into the logs to the left leads to the dining room and open kitchen. The custom-made kitchen has wood cabinetry painted white, an apron front sink and a large island with space for eating. Countertops are granite and appliances are Kenmore Elite. To the right of the main entrance is the master bedroom with vaulted ceilings and a loft storage area, along with a walk-in closet. The master bedroom has access to the large screened-in porch with bow windows. The en-suite master bathroom has a tub with jets, a walk-in shower and walls reinforced for future grab-bar installation. A staircase to the first floor, as well as the elevator, descends to a large family room, three other bedrooms and a bathroom. The home sits on nearly two acres of waterfront property, dotted with purple lupines and landscaped with four rock gardens and gravel walkways leading to a man-made beach of imported pea stone with a fire pit. In Portugal Cove-St. Philip’s, a largely rural town of about 7,400 people, the home is about eight miles west of the provincial capital of St. John’s. Most parts of the capital can be reached in about 10 minutes, including the closest shopping, the golf course, the seaside and the international airport. MARKET OVERVIEW Newfoundland has seen strong economic and housing-market growth in the last decade, spurred by continuing oil-field development, said Chris Janes, a senior market analyst for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation[http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/index.cfm]. Since 2005, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has had three oil fields in full production, and housing prices have more than doubled, growing even during the global real estate crisis of 2008, he said. “We just kept going full-steam ahead through all of that,” Mr. Janes said. “We had very strong population growth and employment growth, and while housing prices may have doubled, we also had incomes growing over that time period as well.” Some overbuilding has occurred in recent years, particularly in condominiums, and the three oil fields are all in natural decline, so Mr. Janes predicted that home prices will continue to grow, but at a more reasonable 2 percent, as opposed to the average of 9 percent that was formerly seen. Growth will be sustained by future oil discoveries and another oil field expected to come online in the 2016-2017 period, he said. The province also has thriving industries in nickel, electricity and information technology. While the average home price in the St. John’s area is 411,000 Canadian dollars, or $383,000, vacation and second homes tend to be priced at 500,000 to 1.5 million Canadian dollars, or $466,000 to $1.4 million, said Glenn Larkin, a real estate agent based in St. John’s with Royal LePage. “We don’t get many sales at the 1.5 million range, though,” he said. “Most of our sales are 500,000 to 700,000 Canadian dollars, which will get you a four-bedroom, two-story home with a two-car garage.” In 2013, only about a dozen homes priced over a million Canadian dollars sold in the St. John’s area, Mr. Larkin said. WHO BUYS IN NEWFOUNDLAND The vast majority of home buyers in Newfoundland are locals or Canadians from other provinces, though executives from oil and gas companies and other large corporations stationed for three or four years in the province will often buy their homes, Mr. Larkin said. Those buyers are typically American, but can come from any country, Mr. Janes said. Several years ago, because of heavy international promotion, many European buyers bought homes in a subdivision called Humber Valley Resort[http://humbervalley.com/] in western Newfoundland that went bankrupt in 2008, Mr. Larkin said. Before 2007, the American dollar was fairly strong relative to the Canadian dollar, and Americans frequently bought second homes in a Newfoundland fishing village called Trinity, a town of a couple hundred people where the 2001 movie “The Shipping News” was filmed. The town has saltbox homes that can range from about 30,000 to 130,000 Canadian dollars, but the strength of the Canadian dollar has made second-home investment less attractive, Mr. Larkin said. BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreign home buyers in Newfoundland and Labrador. Typically, home buyers hire a lawyer to represent them, Mr. Larkin said, and they can anticipate paying about 2 percent of the home’s cost in fees, which include lawyer’s fees, taxes, registration of the mortgage and deed, title search and title insurance. The real estate agent’s commission, typically about 5 percent but negotiable, is paid by the seller, he said. Foreign home buyers can obtain mortgages from Canadian banks, which will typically require a larger down payment of at least 25 percent, Mr. Larkin said. (Canadian citizens with landed immigrant status might put down as little as 5 percent.)

"For Ship-Shape Sheep, Island 'Vacation' Promises Tasty Last Licks Before Slaughter; Farmers Use Plush Pastures of Nearby Islands to Fatten Lambs for Slaughter",NL,"TORS COVE, Newfoundland and Labrador—To transport 400 sheep through the iceberg-dotted waters of the Atlantic in open boats, Howard Morry Jr. has learned a trick: Watch the critters' ears. ""If you see one looking with their ears up, looking like they are going to jump, kind of restrain them,"" he said recently, after ferrying three boatloads of 20 sheep each to two islands off Canada's eastern-most province. Those 60 sheep were among 400 that made the voyage this year. ""But we haven't had any jump overboard yet."" Every spring for nearly 200 years, members of Mr. Morry's family have set sail with their sheep, bound for greener pastures off the coast of Newfoundland. Since there isn't a lot of space for sheep to graze in the rock-ribbed province, farmers use the plush pastures on Ship, Fox and Bois Islands nearby. Free from predators including dogs, coyotes and bears, the sheep graze freely all summer on the islands' lush, sea-sprayed grass and occasionally on seaweed, producing ""salt-water lambs"" known for their unique flavor. ""It's like a summer vacation for them,"" said Mr. Morry, ignoring the plating that awaits the future lamb chops at the end of their holiday. Most lambs are 4 to 8 weeks old when they take the boat ride to the islands with their mothers. At the time, the lambs weigh between 25 and 50 pounds. They will fatten up on the islands and return to the mainland in the fall for slaughtering. That usually happens when the lambs are 5 to 8 months old and weigh 80 to 120 pounds. The ewes, their mothers, will be used as breeding stock for up to a decade. Along with his father, brother and four other sheep farmers, Mr. Morry is preserving a dying tradition, since these are among the province's few remaining sheep. At last count, there were only a couple of thousand sheep left in Newfoundland, and only 400 of them are in this select group that voyage to the islands. At their peak, likely around the Great Depression, sheep numbered an estimated 125,000 in Newfoundland and represented a way of life on the rocky island that remained a British Dominion until 1949. The farmers' timeworn summer pilgrimage is feeding growing demand for pricey, artisanal meat—especially in the newly affluent city of St. John's, which is enjoying an offshore oil boom and much tourism. The limited supply of lamb is highly sought after and is gone by Christmas. ""I'll get personal phone calls from people who are bringing other guests in"" and want to make sure the salt-water lamb is available, said Jeremy Charles, chef and co-owner of Raymonds, a restaurant in St. John's that is among the biggest buyers of the Morry lambs. Prices are popping, nearly doubling in the past 10 years. On average, farmers sell their local lamb meat for about C$6 ($5.58 U.S.) a pound ""dressed weight""—which means the chilled weight of lamb ready to be cut and packaged. That compares to C$3.25 a pound in 2004, Mr. Morry said. Those in the know say the meat is unlike lamb from anywhere else in the world. When cut raw, salt-water lamb is a blush pink similar to pork. Once cooked, the taste is mild and the meat tender. On a warm Sunday in June, after several delays caused by bad weather and adverse tides, the farmers backed a trailer full of sheep onto the dilapidated wharf here in Tors Cove, on Newfoundland's southern shore. There, they began the task of hoisting the sheep, one by one, into a flat-bottomed wooden boat. The sheep's bleating drew a small crowd to the dock. ""There aren't that many people who take their sheep out to islands,"" said Bonnie Johnstone of nearby Witless Bay. Once at sea, the sheep stick their heads over the side to get a whiff of the approaching island's grass. ""As soon as they are out of the boat, they are practically running up the beach, so they can get their mouth around some of that lush, salt grass,"" said the younger Mr. Morry. Transporting the sheep isn't without its dangers. After dropping the second of the three loads, a ride that took about 10 minutes, the farmers' boat hit a small iceberg but was undamaged. Howard Morry Sr., 79, travelled to the wharf to see off his flock. He developed a love of sheep farming after getting his first sheep as a reward for passing first grade when he was 7 years old. ""I've been taking them out to that island for 50 years. Now my sons are doing it,"" he said of Ship Island, unofficially known as ""Sheep Island."" The sheep also summer on Bois Island and Fox Island. Local lore says Fox Island was bequeathed to a local family two centuries ago for guiding a British warship to St. John's in a thick fog. Across from Bois Island, site of an 18th century British garrison, the rusted-out remains of an old cannon still keep watch over the sheep. For the early Irish settlers of Newfoundland, sheep were a staple, and locals say the animals roamed freely, blanketing the hillsides in white. But lamb was always considered a poor man's meat. Soldiers returning from World War II turned up their noses at it after surviving on mutton (mature sheep) rations overseas. Some farmers gave up on sheep after ""anti-roaming"" laws were introduced that required sheep to be fenced in. Newfoundlanders enjoyed an income boost after they officially joined Canada in 1949 and became eligible for federal social programs. Sheep moved to the bottom of the province's food chain—almost. ""You knew that someone was poorer than you if they brought lobster to school,"" said Dale Russell FitzPatrick, a retired sheep farmer and the granddaughter of Newfoundland's first premier, Joseph Smallwood. By 1976, the sheep population had fallen to 9,100. At the start of this year, there were only 2,100 in Newfoundland and Labrador, according to Statistics Canada, the national statistical agency. For locals long weary of being the punchline of ""Newfie"" jokes across Canada and proud to have shed their status as a ""have-not"" province, the high-priced sheep and their gourmet appeal have become a point of pride. During the summer months, Tors Cove residents form an unofficial neighborhood watch to keep tabs on the sheep from shore, using their camera lenses to take a look-see while also listening for any bleats of distress."
"Ghost Towns, Puffins and Unspoiled Views",NL,"Correction Appended Bruce Miller throttled back the engines of his 27-foot boat and entered the pinched harbor at Ireland’s Eye, an uninhabited, rock-rimmed island that lies eight miles off another, much larger island: Newfoundland. Scattered piles of weathered, gray boards dotted the steep, grassy banks like forgotten kindling. The captain held up a black-and-white 8-by-10 photo that echoed the view circa 1940. Back then, the timber stacks were clearly houses, schooners rested at anchor, and on the farthest hill stood a white church. Now, in the church’s place, a steeple lay in the tall grass. Worshipers last attended a service here in 1965, before a government resettlement policy forcibly moved the 157 residents of the remote fishing village, or “outport,” to larger communities in order to centralize the population. “It was all about economics to take people from small communities and put them closer to the infrastructure,” Mr. Miller said, his voice modulating between resignation and anger, “but you can’t take a man who’s lived all his life on the fishing grounds and put him in a city.” The 55-year-old former cod fisherman, born in the similarly abandoned town of Kerley’s Harbour, began guiding outport ghost-town tours three years ago. “It was often said, ‘They moved, but they never arrived,’ ” he said. Last June, I arrived three hours north of St. John’s, the capital of Canada’s easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador, to explore the craggy Bonavista Peninsula and its surrounding waters. The peninsula is one of Newfoundland’s most dramatic appendages, a place where I’d heard that entrepreneurs like Mr. Miller were building a new tourism economy to supplant fishing. Over four days, I found the area’s lonely beauty a compelling backdrop to its history of frontier survival, collapse and 21st-century renewal. Resettlement was just the first blow to Newfoundland, where coastal trees often grow sideways in the wind. For nearly 500 years, the 43,000-square-mile island thrived on cod fishing. But overfishing prompted a moratorium in 1992, resulting in the unemployment of an estimated 30,000 people and the steady depopulation of coastal fishing villages. Now about half of Newfoundland’s 500,000 residents live near the capital of St. John’s, with about six people per square mile beyond. Left with virtually no industry, those who stayed began to exploit Newfoundland’s chief natural asset: its good looks. “That’s why I call my tours Rugged Beauty[http://www.ruggedbeautyboattours.net/],” said Mr. Miller. “That’s what we got left.” The leftovers — a coastal wilderness of towering sea cliffs, surf-strafed beaches and mossy forests — are a visual feast, occasionally attracting Hollywood. The 2001 movie “The Shipping News” was filmed here, as was the recently released “The Grand Seduction.” Twenty-two years into the post-fishing era, the roughly 70-mile-long peninsula seems to have reached a tipping point with just enough going on — good food, distinctive accommodations and interesting tours — to keep a traveler engaged, but not enough to spoil the view. “Suddenly there’s an understanding that people like art on the walls and a decent cup of coffee,” said John Fisher, an Ontario émigré who came to those conclusions in 1997 when he opened Fishers’ Loft, a four-room B&B; in tiny Port Rexton. Today the inn’s 33 rooms are spread among six buildings — brightly painted, wood-shingled saltbox cottages and sea captain’s homes that are distinctive architectural styles of Newfoundland. Tineke Gow, an innkeeper who has owned property on the peninsula since 1975, pioneered the diffused hotel concept here in 1992 when she opened Artisan Inn[http://www.trinityvacations.com/] with two rooms in a 19th-century home in nearby Trinity. Today, 15 rooms are dispersed among six mostly 19th-century houses in the former shipbuilding town that is the peninsula’s small but seasonally swelling center for tourism, fluctuating between 200 residents in summer and about 140 in winter. “The idea is to fit in to the landscape,” Ms. Gow said. “One building with 20 rooms would stand out.” Following these pioneers, younger Newfoundlanders who left for work elsewhere are gradually returning to the Bonavista Peninsula. On a wincingly bright afternoon, I drove to its north shore to meet Katie Hayes, a 27-year-old chef who worked in high-end restaurants in St. John’s and elsewhere before returning to tiny Upper Amherst Cove in 2012 to open Bonavista Social Club[http://bonavistasocialclub.com/], a bakery and cafe with a wood-fired oven that is the culinary talk of the cape. Facing a cobalt bay, the wood-beamed single-story building tops a grassy bank where a goat and several lambs grazed. The self-sufficient chef and her husband, Shane Hayes, raise much of their own food and do their own butchery, including wild game. Beyond the bread — four or five varieties daily — the chef makes the most of local ingredients, serving lobster pasta, fresh crab and seafood soup, in addition to the popular moose burger with partridgeberry ketchup. “It’s nice to showcase what Newfoundlanders have done all their lives,” said Ms. Hayes, offering me a glass of homemade rhubarb lemonade. “You go away and come back with an appreciation for what we have here.” The next morning I joined another itinerant local, 39-year-old Kris Prince of Sea of Whales Adventures[http://www.seaofwhales.com/], aboard his 25-foot Zodiac. The grandson of a fisherman, Mr. Prince spends winters working as an oil field welder in Alberta but returns home each spring to guide whale-watching tours. The wind chill on this rainy June morning felt like February as we bundled into thermal jumpsuits provided by the captain and skipped over the dark water, at times as deep as 1,800 feet. Soon we spied the descending fluke of a diving sperm whale. As we waited for it to resurface, a herd of 300 harp seals churned across the bay, curiously slowing as they passed, bobbing their heads higher to get a good look at the boat and its six gaping passengers, suited like snowmobilers. Whales, icebergs loosed from Greenland and puffins are the principal tourist bait in Newfoundland. To see the latter, I drove to tiny Elliston on the tip of the peninsula, which greeted me with an irony-free sign declaring itself the “Root Cellar Capital of the World.[http://www.rootcellars.com/]” More compelling than the cellar-doored hillsides where vegetables are traditionally stored were a pair of isolated islands just feet from the shorefront cliffs. Here a colony of colorful Atlantic puffins roosted in the ledges, coming and going in acrobatic foraging trips to sea. Relative to the amount of wild land on the peninsula, I found few hiking trails, though the best of them, the dramatic Skerwink Trail[http://www.theskerwinktrail.com/] outside Port Rexton, more than filled the void. The 3.3-mile footpath traces the edge of a towering sandstone headland at the entrance of Trinity Harbor, providing access to pine forests draped in a webby green epiphyte known as Old Man’s Beard, stunted fir trees clinging to salt-sprayed cliffs, views of wave-bashed sea stacks, and bogs covered in azalea blooms. The trail is 10 minutes’ walk from Fishers’ Loft, where last summer John Fisher oversaw the construction of a double-entry labyrinth, in which two walkers can race to the center on circuitous but parallel paths. “We’re still an emerging destination,” Mr. Fisher said over coffee in the inn’s art-filled living room. “People are not hardened to tourism. They’re curious, if anything. The labyrinth is a way to better connect guests to local people.” Later that day, aboard the Rugged Beauty, I joined a couple from Toronto and listened to the stories about fishermen and their hard-working families that Mr. Miller tells to bring Newfoundlanders, past and present, to life. He ended the four-hour cruise at his own cabin built in the resettled outport of British Harbour, a creekside clearing of fallen sheds fronting a white-capped bay ringed in silent forests. Offering me a hand back into the boat, Mr. Miller remained incredulous at his own story. “Can you imagine leaving here willingly?” he asked.

As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Kris Prince, not Price. In addition, the article misstated the name of a village there, and an accompanying map labeled incorrectly the province that includes the island of Newfoundland.

The amazing taste; Loosen your seat belt a few notches for a delectable drive-it-yourself food tour of Newfoundland,NL,"I'm in a meadow, watching icebergs drift across the Atlantic and petting a baby goat, while its mother - whom I just milked by hand - nibbles clover. My travelling companion, Agatha, is threading daisies. Shane, an Irish restaurateur and farmer in Huckleberry-Finn overalls, is leaning on his elbows describing his experiments in feta, kefir and beer, while Clara, his wispy-curled toddler, uses his legs as a sun lounger. The trees rustle; a bald eagle emerges, then it divebombs into the next field. We all gasp. It's the last day of a week-long culinary tour of Newfoundland - from Fogo Island to Bonavista, via St. John's and Heart's Delight - with CapeRace Cultural Adventures. This moment feels so ridiculously perfect that I suspect tour operator Ken Sooley is hiding in the forest, mumbling into a walkie-talkie: ""Soften lights on Berg II."" ""Cue inspiring monologue."" ""Release the bird!"" But that's not how CapeRace works.  Sooley arranges your accommodation, dinner reservations and rental car, then sends you off with The Traveller's Diary, a customized guidebook with insider info on quirky destinations and interesting locals. There's no daytime schedule and the only non-restaurant activity pre-planned is a kitchen party. The premise: Newfoundland will be generous with dramatic backdrops, local delicacies and engaging characters, as long as you're open to letting life unfold. Our first stop is Fogo Island, an outport off the northeast coast. Our digs here: stilt-legged Fogo Island Inn, a brilliant white salt-box-inspired building that has won so many design and tourism awards since opening last year, it should be blushing pink. Both nights we'll dine at the inn on Murray MacDonald's tasting menus, with just glass walls between us and the ocean. MacDonald creates sparse yet playful plates with foraged and hyperlocal ingredients. His kitchen motto: ""to find new ways with old things."" His dessert of pickled crowberries, with mini-puffs of meringue, moist almond layer cake, springy candied caribou moss, dark chocolate dirt, wild blueberry syrup and a crisp kaleand-apple sorbet makes for a singing, dancing, cartwheeling finale of textures and flavours. ""Want a 20,000-year-old piece of ice?"" asks head bartender Jacob Luksic, as he tosses chunks of iceberg into our cocktails. Snaps and crackles ensue. He invites us to sniff molasses bitters and taste homemade ginger syrup, then before we know it, we're behind the bar, flaming lemons, spearing foraged berries, and injecting bubbles into drinks. Our last hurrah happens at Phil's Shed. We met Phil and his wife, Maureen, while hiking past their place earlier. They promised us a party if we popped in later that night. Phil's - with its green fairy lights, battered sofas, and walls more plastered with paraphernalia than a teen's bedroom - has become so popular for partying that last year he had to build a second shed for his tools. ""Scottish... Scottish... Scottish..."" everyone chants, until I sing a song from my homeland. I gulp my rum and Coke. The big cheers I get for ""Geordie Munroe"" far outweigh my talents. The locals break our hearts with perfectly pitched Irish laments and rock and country ballads. Later, in St. John's Battery neighbourhood, I feel an instant love connection walking into our yolk-yellow heritage house, Hare's Ears. Uninterrupted windows on three sides offer sweeping views from Signal Hill, across the harbour, over to the city's pretty painted houses. This is the first of three CapeRace properties we'll stay in - all renovated from teardown condition by Sooley. Our first reservation is at Raymonds, just named Vacay.ca's Canadian Restaurant of the Year. Dinner is a ballet, where servers deliver dishes in unison, sometimes lifting cloches with a flourish that makes me want to cry ""ta-da!"" An injection of oil money in recent years is making it possible for chefs of the calibre of Jeremy Charles (once head chef to the Molson and Bronfman families) to come home and show Newfoundland what they've got. My favourite course comes on a slice of tree trunk, with driftwood centrepiece and stone pedestals for a perfect Black Point oyster with tiny pearls sculpted from cucumber, a moose and fennel salami finnochiona, foie gras and confit duck terrine and a diver scallop carpaccio. ""The divers hand-pick them; they can only bring up 100 at a time - it's a dangerous job,"" says our server. Every dish comes with a tidbit - this place is not too fancy to subdue the natural chattiness of Newfoundlanders. On night two, beanie-clad Todd Perrin hands me a cap and chef's jacket. ""Just remember, the future of Mallard Cottage depends on you tonight,"" he says, grinning as I panic. Instead of dining, I'm joining the team in the Top Chef Canada fan-favourite's open kitchen. When I'm not assembling amusebouches of crostini with egg salad, salt-pork and chives, I'm accepting samples of beet-and-carrot salad or braised pork from the kitchen crew. At the end of my shift, co-owner Stephen Lee passes me a glass of wine and asks what I'd like from the menu. ""I'm not hungry ... I've been picking,"" I confess. ""Said like a true chef,"" he says, laughing. ""The perfect setup for a slow braise,"" says Agatha, appraising our new robin's egg-blue kitchen, where an old-fashioned stove shares the space with a single bed - just like in the 1930s, when the house was built. We're in Heart's Delight, an outport west of St. John's. A knock at the door. It's Sooley and a couple of neighbours, bearing potato salad, homemade bread and a huge crate of lobster. They usher us outside with red wine to catch the kind of flaming sunset that inspires applause at Mexican resorts. Back in the kitchen, we don floral aprons and toss lobsters into the pot. Soon we're cracking shells and ripping out flesh with our teeth - think: Betty Draper possessed by Betty Rubble. We move next door for a screechingin ceremony that involves kissing a cod, downing screech, and kneeling wrapped in Newfoundland flags to recite a saucy tongue twister, which seems all the more saucy for our master of ceremonies' costume malfunction. ""Do up your fly!"" a lady shouts from the sofa, bringing our swearingin as honorary Newfoundlanders to a raucous conclusion. Our last destination is a three-hour drive across pine-forested hills, with mist rolling over the treetops that makes it feel like we're in the Himalayas. There are so many house-sized icebergs on the bay behind our Bonavista home that the outdoors feels air-conditioned. We've got the knack now of blending the planned with the spontaneous - letting life unfold the CapeRace way - and that's how our last official dinner of mooseburgers and wood-fired pizza at Bonavista Social Club leads to that impromptu milking session with Shane's goats. Judging by Agatha's real-estate chat in the meadow, after our perfect moment, I'm lucky she doesn't spontaneously abandon our plan to drive back to the airport. You get a taste for Newfoundland.

Where you ‘longs to?,NL,"It's suddenly a have province. But as novelist Michael Crummey writes, not everyone in Newfoundland and Labrador is in on the boom – and that split may wreak havoc on the locals' idea of ‘here' Property values have tripled since I moved home to St. John's 15 years ago. Condos are replacing old strip malls and abandoned buildings at a steady clip. Even former premier Danny Williams is getting in on the action, spearheading a 970-hectare residential/retail/industrial development. What was a row of unoccupied downtown storefronts and lowend retail when I was at university here in the 1980s is now awash with trendy shops selling Labradorite bracelets for $500 and coffee bars serving Espresso con panna and Aztec Chili Hot Chocolate. There are also restaurants like Raymond's, where customers can order up a seven-course meal featuring Newfoundland cod ($135), paired with wines chosen by the in-house sommelier ($85). God knows we were due for a break. The longtime butt of jokes about backwardness and outmigration, Newfoundland and Labrador is finally bringing people to the area due to a steady economic boom fuelled by multi-billion-dollar developments in off-shore oil, hydroelectricity and nickel processing. But while oil execs tuck into their gourmet fish, much of rural Newfoundland is falling deeper into a crisis that began with the cod moratorium in 1992. A “temporary measure"" when it was imposed, the moratorium is now into its 22nd year. And the most isolated of the province's outports – some are still accessible only by sea – are reeling without the cod that made them possible. The only influx of cash on the horizon for many locals is a government cheque for leaving their homes. By this time next year, some of the island's oldest villages will likely be abandoned. It's anyone's guess how many will have disappeared a decade from now. Hard times and a sense of shared adversity used to be one of the things Newfoundlanders had in common. But the map is being radically redrawn these days and we are, increasingly, a province of two solitudes. Traditional Newfoundland – a world of isolated, tightly knit communities that relied on the fishery and each other for survival – is still at the heart of our conception of ourselves, of how we present ourselves to the world. But with every passing year, that conception has less to do with the reality on the ground. A generation from now, what it means to be a Newfoundlander will be something altogether different. Earlier this summer, I visited some outports on a cruise ship operated by an Ontario company that specializes in trips to out-of-the-way destinations. I was the resident culturalist on board, hired to help “interpret"" the place to travellers from as far afield as Europe and Australia. The tourists signed on for the chance to see the remarkable physical landscape, the icebergs and whales and seabirds. And also to experience traditional Newfoundland, to meet people whose families have lived in the same isolated communities for two centuries. One of our first ports of call was Little Bay Islands, for many years a centre of the cod fishery in the region – and the hometown of one of the ship's staffers, Gerry Strong, who offered a guided walk “up around shore."" Gerry was born into the merchant family that ran the local fish trade here through much of the last century. “Strong's Room,"" as it was known, included the buildings where the fish was cleaned and salted, and an entire hectare of fish flakes where the cod was set out to dry. Rail tracks ran the length of the flakes, to help lay out the fish in the morning and collect it again at the end of the day. Trading vessels from Europe and the Mediterranean sailed into Little Bay Islands in the fall to buy the salt cod. Gerry's father often fell asleep listening to the Greek sailors drinking and playing music on their ships in the harbour. When Gerry was a boy, he played in a large sandbox filled with ballast from trading ships that came to the outport from as far away as India and Egypt. That incarnation of Little Bay Islands – vibrant, self-sufficient, oddly cosmopolitan – ceased to exist some time ago. Most of the younger residents have left to find work elsewhere. Many houses sit empty. Islanders have to take a three- to four-hour roundtrip by ferry to buy groceries or see a doctor. The school here still operates, but there is only a single student. The most action the gymnasium sees is when the Women's Home League lays out a feed for visiting tourists. And much of the talk over partridgeberry pie and toutons was about “resettlement."" A referendum was held here last winter, with 55 of the 69 voters in favour of leaving Little Bay Islands for good. “We knows we have to go,"" said one woman, who admitted she had never lived anywhere else. I asked how old she was. “Eighty-two this year."" “Where will you go?"" She laughed. “I haven't got a clue."" But that resignation isn't unanimous. Among the dissenters is Gerry Strong's old babysitter, a retired nurse who moved back to Little Bay Islands after a 30-year career in Montreal. “This is not over,"" she told me. And she looked ready for a fight. A $270,000 moving bonus It's not a new fight. Sixty years ago, the Joey Smallwood government launched the first ham-fisted resettlement program to drag the province into the 20th century. New to Confederation and Canada's cradle-to-grave social programs, Mr. Smallwood faced the near-impossible task of delivering modern conveniences such as roads and electricity, as well as health and education services, to 1,200 communities scattered along 29,000 kilometres of coastline. Reaching the province's smallest and most remote outports was so impractical that households were paid between $300 and $600 to move to a more central community. Between 1954 and 1965, 30,000 people from 300 outports relocated. In 1965, the government's resettlement package increased to $1,000 per family, plus $200 per dependent. An additional 20,000 people left behind 148 outports in the decade that followed. But if it was technically a “voluntary"" program, resettlement was mired in controversy. In the hundreds of outports that accepted packages, there was rarely universal assent. Neighbours and relatives were pitted against one another. Coercion and intimidation, subtle or otherwise, poisoned friendships and families. Many people moved under duress and lived the rest of their days in a kind of internal exile. It's a touchy subject, still. And after an extended period of dormancy, resettlement is making a comeback, fuelled by chronic unemployment in the fishery and an aging demographic. After a lengthy and acrimonious internal debate, Great Harbour Deep on the Northern Peninsula took a government package to relocate in 2002. Petites was abandoned in 2003. The residents of Grand Bruit, also on the south coast, followed suit in 2010. The modern version of resettlement is different in this crucial respect: the government is happy to facilitate the process, but only when outport residents make the request. Withdrawal of power generation, regular ferry runs and other essential services to unsustainable communities is a longterm economic win – but the government isn't about to “force"" relocation on anyone. Instead, they're sweetening the pot. Last year's provincial budget nearly tripled the cash incentive per household from $100,000 to $270,000. The requirement that a decision to resettle be unanimous was also set at a more workable 90 per cent. All this hasn't set off the mad rush to move that some might have expected, but the numbers and interest are growing. Round Harbour on the Baie Verte Peninsula has voted in favour of the move. The Department of Municipal Affairs has met with residents of south coast communities Gaultois and McCallum, and has working files for Snook's Harbour on Random Island, William's Harbour in southern Labrador and Nipper's Harbour on the Baie Verte Peninsula. La Poile, also on the south coast, has set up a resettlement committee and residents are filling out official “expression of interest"" forms. Barring a sudden recovery of the cod stocks, what we're seeing now is likely the thin edge of the wedge. What is lost It was raining steadily as we steamed toward Francois (usually pronounced Fran-sway) on the south coast. The 600-foot headlands disappeared in fog above us. I've done a half-dozen circumnavigations, and on each Francois has been a favourite stop. Tiered on steep hills at the foot of a stunning fjord, it looks and feels like something out of another world, another time. First settled in the late 1700s, it is one of the communities that successfully resisted the Smallwood resettlement program. There are no cars and no roads. Residents are able to travel to the nearest town by snowmobile during the winter, otherwise the only access is by boat. Less than a hundred people still live here, a handful fewer each time we visit. I've alway thought of this community as a microcosm of Newfoundland's place in the world before Confederation: singular and inaccessible and largely unknown. Francois, and hundreds of other outports like it, are the crucible in which the distinct linguistic and cultural character of Newfoundland was formed. Buchans, the central Newfoundland mining town where I was raised, is an anomaly in the province – a community nowhere near salt water, its residents all from “somewhere else."" But both of my parents were raised in outports, as were all of their friends and neighbours. No one ever locked or knocked on a door. We had no blood relatives in town, but I was surrounded by people I called uncle and aunt, to acknowledge a tie that felt familial. Even as a youngster I recognized that “the outport"" had made these people who they were. The accents around me reflected this: Some people dropped their aitches, some added haitches. Isolated from the larger world and from one another, each of Newfoundland's bays developed dozens of distinct dialects. Even now, 60 years into standardized education, in a time when every child is raised on 200 mainland cable channels, it's still possible to identify where someone is from by the particular idiosyncrasies of their speech. That isolation, coupled with dependence on an industry as fickle and dangerous as the cod fishery, also bred a distinctly Newfoundland character – a peculiar mix of self-reliance and fatalism, a longsuffering acquiescence to larger forces that can look to mainland eyes like defeatism; a flahoolic generosity and love of a good time, an irreverent sense of humour, a well-known gift of the gab. “If you don't want any part of engaging conversation,"" one of our expedition staff warns passengers, “don't make eye contact with a Newfoundlander."" The people who lived in Buchans carried the outport with them when they moved inland to work the mines. Through their influence, the outport shaped me as well, though I didn't spend more than a few weeks a year near the ocean. Even as the fishery has diminished over recent decades, even as more and more Newfoundlanders move to the mainland or to larger urban centres on the island, the culture and character of the people remains remarkably unchanged. But there's a question troubling me as I enjoy my bacon-wrapped scallop and spinach salad downtown in St. John's, watching another BMW drive by: How far can the outport travel before we lose it altogether? Ashore in Francois, we wandered the warren of paths in the continued downpour. The most adventurous slogged their way to the lookout at Charlie's Head. Except for our local guides the weather kept folks inside, and the town felt nearly abandoned. There was a reception at the Community Hall, where we dried out and dug into a lunch of bakeapple tarts and molasses buns. I sat with three of the women who prepared the food and the conversation turned, inevitably, to resettlement. There was an “internal"" vote on the issue over the winter, but there wasn't “enough interest"" at the time, one of the women told me. I asked if she thought it would happen eventually. “Oh it will,"" she said. “It might be next year. Or ten years from now. But it will happen."" It's a sad fact of life that the disappearance of these and other outport communities won't alter much about the world at large. The GDP won't change, the oil boom will carry on pumping money into provincial coffers, the northeast Avalon will continue to be swallowed by cookie-cutter suburbs. In almost every way we quantify such things, their absence will make no difference. But the loss we're facing is real, if subtler and harder to measure. It may be true that we won't be poorer without them. But we will be, intangibly and inevitably, something less. Michael Crummey is a novelist in St. John's. His book Sweetland, about a community faced with resettlement, is in stores Aug. 19."
Canada's real top chef,NL,"Just as the country's culinary experts debate the definition of Canadian cuisine, along comes Jeremy Charles, of Newfoundland's Raymonds Restaurant: one of the ‘humblest, most salt-of-the-earth guys you'll ever meet – and he's figured it all out' Derek Dammann, chef at Montreal's Maison Publique, and chef Jesse Vergen of New Brunswick's Saint John Ale House – two of the most talented and respected chefs in Canada – were seated at an elegant corner table in a Newfoundland restaurant. They were, as locals might say, in the middle of having a feed. A seafood platter lay between them. This wasn't, however, the usual basic shellfish-plus-bivalve medley. The platter – a freshly felled cross-section of tree trunk – had arrived bearing delicacies like smoky surf clams stuffed with wild sea greens and chives and salsa verde capelins ensconced within razor-thin shrouds of lardo. The two chefs were incredulous. “This is, by far, the best food in Canada right now,"" exclaimed Dammann, a mixture of admiration and surrender colouring his voice. “It's ridiculous,"" added Vergen, not realizing what was still to come – the Acadian caviar, the cod, the grouse, the seal, the moose. Vergen would later describe that tasting menu at Raymonds Restaurant, in downtown St. John's, as “probably the top meal I've ever had in my whole life. In terms of terroir-driven food, nothing even comes close."" For those who haven't yet tried chef Jeremy Charles's wild foods at Raymonds: Dammann and Vergen can assure you it's worth the pilgrimage. By now, Raymonds has won several “No. 1 restaurant in Canada"" awards. High-level international chefs have been wowed by Charles's abilities through his appearances at Cook It Raw events – prestigious gatherings of the world's top chefs. “Jeremy is easily Canada's most important chef at this point,"" explains chef Daniel Burns of Luksus in New York, who has cooked at Noma, the Fat Duck and Momofuku Labs. All of this buzz (alongside that emanating from nearby Mallard Cottage, run by Todd Perrin) is luring curious diners to Newfoundland. As Dammann states, “I'm positive that what Jeremy and Todd are doing here will make St. John's the next major food travel destination in the world."" Not bad for a place that, 10 years ago, felt almost bereft of dining options. Sure, Newfoundland had its old standbys – cod tongues, toutons and scrunchions – but nobody would have considered them contenders for the world's next “it"" cuisine. Now, with the rise of nose-to-tail dining, Newfoundland food is finding itself up there with other formerly disdained and now-desirable cuisines such as Roman quinto quarto or traditional British fare. What's happening at Raymonds Restaurant is more complex – and exciting – than that. They're certainly using indigenous ingredients and local traditions, but they're mixing these with a new-Nordic-inspired understanding of how best to transform the bounty around them. Think fresh diver scallops in a sea urchin beurre blanc, or moose charcuterie paired with crispy puffs of lichen. Not exactly salt junk and hard tack. What Charles and his team are doing is not only helping redefine Newfoundland cuisine, but they're also getting into something more profound – into questions of identity, of what it means to live on the Rock and live off the land and be part of this immense country. “All of us chefs are looking for the identity of Canadian cuisine today,"" says Vergen, “and then along comes Jeremy Charles, one of the nicest, humblest, most salt-of-the-earth guys you'll ever meet, and he's figured it all out."" Newfoundland cuisine has always been one of necessity, of making do with what nature gives you, and of ingenuity. “Newfoundland has a very distinct culinary tradition that is still very much alive,"" explains Ian Mosby, a food historian and L.R. Wilson postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University. “Their cuisine has always been connected to the cod fishery, to isolation and to poverty. Newfoundlanders couldn't afford to eat many imported foods, so they developed a culture of eating locally available ingredients."" Raymonds is tapping into the roots of Newfoundland cuisine while also elevating it into a highly refined version of itself. A meal at Raymonds is not cheap: A seven-course tasting menu, with wine pairing, is $220 before tax and tip. Those prices are a reflection of the new Newfoundland economy, buoyed by the oil boom. The real forces that conspired to make Raymonds a reality are two Jeremys: Jeremy Charles and Jeremy Bonia, the restaurant's co-owners and partners. The two had previously worked at Atlantica in nearby Portugal Cove, and they're intimately connected to Newfoundland. Charles, 36, was 7 in St. John's, and much of his youth was spent around fishermen. “My childhood memories are about going down to the wharf when boats were coming in,"" he recalls. “I'd be cutting out cod tongues and selling them to the tourists. As a young boy, you tried to get a bit of loot to buy a fishing rod to keep you going for the summer."" Charles often joined his father on hunting and fishing trips, where he discovered his love of working with his hands. “For me, it all began with tying flies – the intricacy of it,"" he says. “Whatever you can imagine you can tie onto a hook. There are endless possibilities – kind of like cooking."" His fly-tying approach to the culinary world is part of the reason Charles's food is so meticulous. “The attention to detail in every dish at Raymonds is astounding,"" notes Dammann. “Take that surf clam. Everybody in Canada has access to surf clams, but nobody knows how to cook a surf clam like Jeremy Charles."" Why is that? “Because he's put so much thought into it. … The execution of technique is always there in every plate. Plus he's a hunter. Being able to hunt, forage and fish in your own backyard – and serve the things you catch in your own restaurant – basically means he has the advantage over every other chef in North America. He simply has a closer connection to the ingredients he's cooking than anyone else."" Other chefs can forage, but few of them are legally allowed to serve wild game, as Raymonds can, thanks to Newfoundland's more understanding laws. Unlike other places (New York, Paris or Montreal, say) that have taken inspiration from the avant-garde foraging movement in Scandinavia, Newfoundlanders actually have access to a dazzling array of readily available Arctic edibles, from beach peas and Scotch lovage on the water's edge to cloudberries and partridge berries in the barrens. Part of the reason Raymonds has been so accepted locally is the number of foragers, hunters and fishermen working with them. “I've turned over a lot of rocks trying to find the people living off the land,"" Charles explains. “We've made a lot of relationships and are supporting people and encouraging them to support us."" Hunters now know to provide Raymonds with braces of partridge, spruce grouse or ptarmigan. Trappers are out snaring hares for them in the fall. Fishermen bring them their finest snow crab, cod, sea urchin, even seal meat, in season. Newfoundland has been undergoing difficult transitions over the past decades. By forging new ties, Charles is helping certain traditions to stay alive, albeit in an updated guise. Charles's awareness of what makes Newfoundland unique stems from the time he's spent abroad, whether cooking in his 20s in Montreal, Los Angeles and Chicago, or with his peers at international conferences, or attending the MAD symposia in Denmark, or making trips to eat at top restaurants like Fäviken – an avant-garde wild-food temple in Sweden. The only way you can know what makes your corner of the world so special is to truly understand the qualities that set it apart. Charles himself is a perfect embodiment of Newfoundland – self-effacing yet knowledgeable, as ahead of his time as he is linked to the past. He did the interview for this piece while returning from a fishing trip in Labrador. He and his friends had been travelling by helicopter, and at one point they dropped down onto a tiny island to forage for some oyster plants, caribou moss “and other lovely shore greens."" Before heading back, they paused just long enough to hack a couple of chunks off a nearby iceberg – for ice in the cocktails they'd make that weekend. One of Charles's most interesting dishes is his take on cod sounds. The sounds are the cod's ballast, the part that allows the fish to go up and down in the water. It inflates and deflates, letting them submerge or rise. It's a part you never find for sale in the rest of Canada. In the past, Newfoundlanders would cook the sounds up in fat. What he and his team decided to do was put the cod sounds in their dehydrator to see what would happen. Out came these translucent, brittle discs. “We tried frying them like chicharrones, and they puffed right up,"" Charles recalls. They'd become an entirely new thing, a kind of enlarged, crispy fish chip. “It's like a Newfoundland nacho,"" Charles says, with a laugh. “You add some crème fraîche and shrimp and cod roe and it's a beautiful, unique thing."""

Global risks could affect modest economic growth in Atlantic Canada: think-tank,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ A stronger U.S. economy and weaker loonie should help exporters, says the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council in a new report that predicts modest growth throughout the region next year. But the independent think-tank's annual economic outlook released Monday also warns of global factors that could wipe out even those projected gains. ``Aside from geopolitical tensions, the potential for a renewed recession in the euro area and increased financial volatility as U.S. monetary policy begins to tighten are significant risks to growth in 2015,'' it says. Nova Scotia is expected to lead the pack, with gross domestic product forecast to grow about 1.9 per cent as spending ramps up for the federal shipbuilding project. In New Brunswick, the report says government capital spending will contribute to a projected GDP increase of 1.7 per cent. Growth in Newfoundland and Labrador and P.E.I. is predicted at 1.5 and 1.4 per cent, respectively. Consumer spending is likely to remain modest across the region as job creation stalls, says the report. Sluggish housing starts are also expected. ``Overall growth is still fairly subdued,'' David Chaundy, the council's senior economist, said from Halifax. ``There are still a lot of key risks around the global economy and things that could impact that forecast as the year plays out.'' Those variables include violence in the Middle East, instability in Ukraine and economic uncertainty in Europe, Chaundy said. ``There's a lot of risks that could see those forecasts go higher in some cases, but certainly more likely to go down if some things don't work out quite as we had assumed.'' Higher natural gas production in Nova Scotia will help drive up GDP growth by about 1.6 per cent this year but its housing market continues to weaken, says the report. Starts were down 26 per cent from last year as of September. Expected growth in New Brunswick next year is propelled by increased exports and more government spending on capital projects, says the report. It cites lumber exports to the U.S._ up 13 per cent over last year as of August _ as U.S. housing starts are expected to jump by 25 per cent next year. Chaundy said the region's heavy reliance on commodities with fluctuating prices adds to the unpredictability. ``One of the key things that stands out is we are still quite dependent on resources. We see this in particular in Newfoundland and Labrador.'' A projected decline in GDP of 0.8 per cent this year for the province is mostly due to a drop in oil and mining output, Chaundy said. Sharon Horan, chairwoman of the St. John's Board of Trade, stressed the importance of controlled spending. The province counts on the offshore oil sector for about one-third of government revenues. It anchored its last budget on a projected average price of US$105 a barrel. ``We just need to be certain that we budget conservatively and spend within our means,'' Horan said. Brent crude was trading Monday for just over US$84 a barrel. It costs the provincial treasury about $30 million for each dollar the average price winds up below the budgeted forecast. Newfoundland and Labrador was $388.6 million in the red for 2013-14, its third straight deficit budget. Still, Horan said housing prices and high wages, especially in the St. John's region, have held as major project investment in the province has reached record levels. ``We're very optimistic that we continue to have a bright future ahead.'' KEY FIGURES IN A NEW REPORT BY THE ATLANTIC PROVINCES ECONOMIC COUNCIL ON THE ECONOMY IN THE REGION FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT: Newfoundland and Labrador: Real GDP growth is forecast to decline 0.8 per cent this year as oil and mining output drop. The economy is forecast to grow by 1.5 per cent in 2015. Prince Edward Island: Growth remains steady at 1.3 per cent this year, driven by gains in tourism and exports. Real GDP is forecast to grow 1.4 per cent next year. Nova Scotia: Real GDP is forecast to be about 1.6 per cent this year because of higher natural gas production. The the start of production on the federal government's shipbuilding program is mainly behind next year's growth forecast of about 1.9 per cent. New Brunswick: Modest economic growth of one per cent is forecast for this year, but is projected to improve to 1.7 per cent next year through increased exports and government capital spending.

Press Release: Equitable Bank Achieves National Status as Single Family Lender with Growth in Maritimes,NL,"Equitable Bank Achieves National Status as Single Family Lender with Growth in Maritimes Canada NewsWire TORONTO, Nov. 24, 2014 TORONTO, Nov. 24, 2014 /CNW/ - Equitable Bank, a subsidiary of Equitable Group Inc. (TSX: EQB and EQB.PR.C) (""Equitable"" or the ""Company"") and a leader in providing alternative mortgage solutions, today announced it has expanded its single family lending services business throughout the Maritime provinces in response to strong demand from the mortgage broker community. In announcing this multi-province launch, Andrew Moor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Equitable said: ""The expansion of the Bank's operations to Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island from our Maritime home base of Halifax makes Equitable a true coast-to-coast alternative single family lender, now serving borrowers and their mortgage broker advisors in all Canadian provinces. This is an outstanding accomplishment that reflects a strategy we adopted five years ago to establish our single family lending services brand in the east and the west. We can't think of a better way to drive the last spike than to open in these Maritime markets. With our footprint established, we look forward to building our business in partnership with an Atlantic Canada mortgage broker community that shares our dedication to customer service."" Each of the Maritime communities that the Bank now serves, including St. John's, Saint John, Moncton, Fredericton and Charlottetown, derives economic strength -- and property value sustainability -- from public and private sector sources of employment. Each has an attractive mix of single family property types and is home to a vibrant mortgage broker community. For example, Foreign Direct Investment magazine recently named Fredericton first among North America's top 10 micro cities for economic potential and quality of life. St. John's enjoys one of the highest levels of GDP per capita of any city in Canada and is eastern Canada's oil and gas capital. Moncton is home to several prominent corporations in insurance and information technology and is a hub for surrounding communities with a total population of 1.6 million. Saint John attracts well over a million visitors a year as a major tourist destination. ""Our mortgage broker partners in the Maritimes encouraged us to take this initiative because they believe, as do we, that borrowers deserve healthy competitive choice,"" said Kim Kukulowicz, Vice President of Residential Sales and Partner Relations. ""By bringing new options to the market, we look forward to helping borrowers realize their personal goals, whether it's buying a home or vacation property or ownership for investment purposes."" Residential single family lending is the Bank's fastest-growing lending operation. It funds first mortgages for owner-occupied and investment properties with up to four units, including detached or semi-detached houses, townhouses and condominiums. ""We're very proud to launch in centres that are widely recognized as attractive places to live, work and invest,"" said Brian Leland, Vice President of Residential Credit. ""Our goal now is to achieve and sustain the level of customer and mortgage broker responsiveness that Equitable has become known for in other Canadian communities. Doing so will make us, over time, Atlantic Canada's mortgage lender of choice."" As a lending leader, Equitable Bank offers a suite of alternative fixed-rate, adjustable, fully open and high ratio mortgage products, all exclusively through the mortgage broker channel in Atlantic Canada and nationally. A new suite of Equitable prime mortgage products is currently debuting in Western Canada and Ontario where the Bank has a well-established presence. Over time, the Bank intends to introduce its EQB Evolution Suite(TM) prime products through mortgage brokers across the country. Over the past four decades as a Canadian lender, Equitable has established itself as an important alternative source of single-family residential mortgages and is now recognized as a leader by independent mortgage brokers across the country. This leadership position was recently acknowledged in the 2014 Brokers on Lenders Survey by Canadian Mortgage Professional magazine. The magazine presented Equitable Bank with silver awards in Underwriter Support, Broker Support and BDM Support and placed Equitable among Canada's top four lenders taking into account a range of capabilities that complete the broker experience including credit, sales, funding, mortgage services, renewals, marketing and internal support systems. The Bank's newest lending territories also include Mount Pearl, Paradise, Conception Bay, Torbay, Goulds, Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove and Portugal Cove-St. Phillip's in Newfoundland, Rothesay, Quispamsis, Riverview, Dieppe, Hanwell and New Maryland in New Brunswick, and Cornwall, Stratford and Summerside in PEI. ""Our team has done a considerable amount of research to understand the needs of the mortgage broker community in the Maritimes and the unique dynamics of each of these local property markets,"" said Mr. Moor, ""As a result, we have gained a solid appreciation for the opportunities available and confidence that we can win over borrowers and mortgage brokers in the Maritimes by providing great service. We look forward to getting started.""

"From Hey Rosetta to Joseph Boyden, artists want buffer around Gros Morne park",NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ Canadian artists, writers and musicians ranging from Hey Rosetta to novelist Joseph Boyden are pushing for action to protect Gros Morne National Park in western Newfoundland. They've signed an open letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Premier Paul Davis urging a buffer zone to prevent hydraulic fracturing and other development near the UNESCO world heritage site. Gros Morne received that designation from the United Nations in 1987 and draws thousands of visitors each year. Its famous hiking trails wind through thick forests and across stunning clifftop views over glacier-cut fjords. Its 1,800 square kilometres also feature geological wonders such as the Tablelands that have helped scientists understand how the Earth's outer shell has shifted over millions of years. ""Gros Morne National Park is one of the national treasures that make us proud to be Canadians,'' says the letter dated Jan. 5 and publicly released Monday. ""We were shocked, therefore, to learn about a proposal in 2013 to conduct oil drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) activities next to the park, considering the threat that this would pose to its ecosystems, its pristine natural beauty, and the thriving local tourism economy.'' The letter urges Harper and Davis to help create a buffer zone around Gros Morne ""that will be kept permanently free from industrialization.'' Its 32 signatures include those of astronaut Roberta Bondar, writer Lawrence Hill of ""The Book of Negroes,'' musician Tim Baker of Hey Rosetta and actor Greg Malone of ""Codco.'' The letter is copied to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. It recommended last June that the federal government create a permanent protective zone around the park. Neither the Prime Minister's Office nor the premier responded to requests for comment. The province announced in November 2013 a temporary halt to potential fracking applications while it internally reviewed regulations and potential impacts. While the government had received no formal proposals to frack wells, exploration licences granted in what's known as the Green Point shale near Gros Morne touched off intense debate. Many residents raised concerns about groundwater pollution and other risks. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking pumps massive volumes of water combined with nitrogen, sand and chemicals at high pressure to shatter shale rock, allowing gas or oil to flow through well bores to the surface. It's believed Newfoundland's west coast has deep shale formations that hold potentially huge reserves of oil, unlike more shallow coalbed gas deposits in western Canada and parts of the U.S. The provincial Progressive Conservative government has stressed it puts health and environmental safety first but wants a balanced approach to industrial development. Groups such as the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas Industries Association say thousands of wells have been fracked in western Canada without environmental damage. But the Council of Canadians and other critics warn a lack of independent research and baseline measurements before and after fracking cast doubt on any safety assurances. Last October, the province named a five-member external panel with environment, geology, engineering and public health expertise to report within a year on the implications of fracking in western Newfoundland. Eric Hebert-Daly, executive director of the watchdog group Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, helped co-ordinate the open letter as part of a broader campaign for a Gros Morne buffer. The park's coveted UNESCO status depends in part on its preservation, he said in an interview. ""This seems like a no-brainer. We really just need to find the time and the effort on the part of both governments to find the solution to what that buffer zone needs to look like, and get on with it.'' Malone said Gros Morne is a place like no other, especially as development erodes what remains of the globe's wilderness. ""Encroaching on the very few areas we have preserved as outstanding examples of the natural world is just, in my view, unacceptable greed,'' he said in an interview. ""We don't need to do that.'' _ Follow bsuebailey on Twitter."
"TD projects lower growth, weaker loonie",NL,"Due mainly to the steep drop in oil prices, TD Bank has cut its 2015 growth forecast for Canada's economy and sees the loonie shedding a few more pennies by year's end. TD further predicts that the Bank of Canada will cut its key interest rate in March by another quarter of a percentage point - which is likely to put further pressure on the Canadian dollar on top of last week's rate cut - as part of a rare revision to its standard economic outlook issued in December. ""We usually stick to our quarterly forecast calendar,"" explains Derek Burleton, TD Economics' vice-president and deputy chief economist. ""It's unusual for us to issue an update, but the change in climate was so significant so we were pushed into action."" TD says it now expects the Canadian economy to grow by 2 per cent this year compared with its expectation just last month for 2.3-per-cent growth in 2015. The bank estimates growth in 2016 will come in at 2.2 per cent, and the Canadian dollar will sink as low as 75 cents U.S. early next year. The loonie will steadily fall to the 77-cent level by the end of this year, it says. ""While consumers will get some relief at the pumps, this benefit is more than offset by lower corporate profits and weaker income growth,"" says the bank report reissued Monday. The new report says lower crude prices will take a bite out of both output and incomes and will be particularly hard on the oil-producing provinces of Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Saskatchewan. ""Economic activity in Alberta is projected to grind to a virtual standstill in 2015,"" TD says. Non energy-based economies, especially Ontario, are expected to benefit with ""strong contributions"" to manufacturing and tourism sectors, the report notes. In the update, TD even nudged slightly upwards its 2015 growth forecast for Ontario to 2.7 per cent from 2.6 per cent followed closely by B.C. at 2.6 per cent and gains of 2.3 per cent in Nova Scotia and Manitoba. ""It will play out very differently in various regions of the country, with Ontario at the top of the leader board,"" says Burleton. ""Provinces most dependent on oil revenues are expected to feel the lion's share of the pain,"" the report says. The bank predicts the U.S. benchmark price for oil will average $47 (U.S.) this year and $65 in 2016, down from its December forecast of $68 in 2015 and $80 next year. ""Lower corporate profits will likely lead to a contraction in business investment and weaker employment growth relative to our December forecast,"" the new TD report says. Meanwhile, the Royal Bank of Canada became the first major lender to lower mortgage rates Monday after five-year bond yields fell in the wake of a surprise cut by the Bank of Canada last week, according to rate-monitoring websites. Royal Bank, the country's second-biggest lender by assets, offered a five-year fixed rate of 2.84 per cent on Jan. 24, down from 2.94 per cent last week, according to rate-tracking website Ratespy.com. That's below RBC's posted rate of 4.84 per cent. The bank also trimmed its three-, seven- and 10-year rates, according to CanadianMortgageTrends.com, an industry news website. The bank joins other lenders standing pat on its 3-per-cent prime rate, which is tied to variable mortgages and lines of credit. Prime typically moves in tandem with the Bank of Canada rate, which was cut to 0.75 per cent on Jan. 21.

Magnetic north,NL,"Features | THE BIG READ Never mind Scandi-noir, the zeitgeist is creeping upwards - to the Arctic Circle. GERARD GILBERT considers the pull the pole has always exerted on us, from Greek myth to the new TV thriller 'Fortitude' When writer Simon Donald was a teenager in early 1980s Scotland, he used tell people that when he grew up he hoped to join the British Antarctic Survey team. He wasn't sure where this ambition came from but, he says: ""Here was something about the extremes, the purity and the starkness. Everything is crystal, clear and defined… unlike adolescence"". The poles answer many calls, it seems, including the confused yelps of pre-adulthood. It was ever thus. The ""Frozen North"", the Arctic, was once a pristine adventure playground for the curious and the greedy and - as a Norwegian ship's captain in Michelle Paver's polar ghost story Dark Matter puts it - ""where you can breathe with both lungs"". But it's also a metaphor, a state of mind, an otherness and a damned good setting for a story. The last great wilderness, you might call it if you didn't fear sounding like a clichéd script for a nature documentary. And in our increasingly over-heated planet it seems that we are increasingly attracted to the cold. Certainly television drama has been steadily heading in that direction. Like 16th-century explorers mapping out the terra incognita to the north of Newfoundland, Norway and Greenland, where their charts blurred and the cartographer's imagination took over (""here be dragons""), so television drama is giving us an ever fuller picture of the frigid climes. From its base camp in Copenhagen, home of The Killing and Borgen, it crossed the Oresund strait to the Malmo of The Bridge before striking out for Norway, setting for the political thriller Mammon and the comedy Lilyhammer, with an idiosyncratic detour to Iceland - where The Night Shift brought the more adventurous BBC4 viewer a workplace sitcom whose ""sit"" was a service station outside Reykjavik. Now, with Simon Donald's 12-part Sky Atlantic thriller Fortitude, the new box-set age of prestige television drama has at last unambiguously breached the Arctic Circle. Despite actually being filmed in Iceland, which is sub-Arctic, Fortitude is set further north, in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, or Spitsbergen as it was first named by its Dutch discoverer, William Barents, whose name lingers in the Barents Sea. Donald tells me that he first settled on an Arctic setting because what his story needed was permafrost. Fair enough - and it beats, say, the freezer storage unit in an abattoir. When Sky Atlantic came into the picture, he also required a mainly British cast, and so Michael Gambon, Jessica Raine and Christopher Eccleston - as well as the American Stanley Tucci and the Danish Sofie Grabol - are to be found in his fictional Svalbard town. This is a land where polar bears roam, but no Eskimos - at least in the first two episodes of Fortitude. Maybe they don't exist in Svalbard. According to the writer A. A. Gill, ""Svalbard was too hardcore even for Eskimos"". It does mean ""cold coast"" in Norwegian. There are several etymological theories about the term Eskimo, some claiming it derives from the Inuit word for ""eaters of raw meat"" - hence one reason why it's now frowned upon. The Inuit word for Europeans is ""kabloona"", which is supposed to refer to our bushy eyebrows - well-groomed Europeans presumably being rare in those parts. Kabloona is also the title of a terrific 1939 travel book by the aristocratic French adventurer Gontran de Poncins, who spent a year living with the indigenous people of the Canadian Arctic, gradually coming to respect their ways. But for most of its literary history, the Arctic has been empty space. When I ask him about the attractions of an Arctic setting, Donald says that it's ""the isolation… the fact that you're locked in… the Arctic is a wonderful intensifier."" Good conditions for sitcoms, and also for horror stories. Donald had originally intended to write a horror film - his primary influences being John Carpenter's 1982 movie The Thing, in which a parasitical alien lifeform emerged from the ice, and Dan Simmons's novel The Terror, in which the American horror writer speculated on the fate of Captain Franklin's ill-fated 1840s expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In Simmons's 2007 novel, the survivors are stalked by a supernatural creature, and the author won't have been the first to connect the Arctic with monsters - in fact the link has an impeccable provenance in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, with its first and last scenes set on the polar ice cap. ""I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation,"" says Robert Walton, the narrator of Shelley's Gothic novel. ""It ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. The sun is forever visible… there the snow and frost are banished."" Fat chance of that, but then Shelley, as late as the 19th-century, was merely reflecting an idyllic vision of the Arctic handed down by the Ancient Greeks, with their mythical Hyperborea, where the north wind (the ""borea"") came from. Counter-intuitively, the Greeks believed that at the very top of the world sat a tropical paradise set in balmy seas. Talk about packing the wrong clothes. The polar ice cap of course is nothing but frozen sea - shrinking and expanding according to the seasons - and a scientific impossibility according to those kings and queens who funded expeditions to find a northern sea passage to China and India. The Elizabethan privateer Martin Frobisher was among the first of these entrepreneurs, and Frobisher's insistence that the tusked narwhals he encountered were a species of unicorn must have seemed entirely plausible to the 16th-century mind. Other tales spoke of pygmies, dragons, epic whirlpools and of a mysterious black rock that stood at the North Pole itself. Believers in a hollow earth - who thought there was another world beneath this one's surface - held the entrance to this nether world would be found in the Arctic. But those hardy realists, the whalers, reignited interest in the Northwest Passage when they reported that the ice cap was melting. It may be a case of the literary imagination pre-empting events that the year of Frankenstein's publication, 1818, also saw the first serious British polar expedition in more than 100 years, as Sir John Ross undertook the first of three trips around the Canadian Arctic islands - the final 1850 voyage being undertaken to look for his naval colleague, Sir John Franklin, whose mysterious fate gripped the world for the next decade. Jack London was the most celebrated Victorian-Edwardian chronicler of the hardships of life in the Arctic, with his two classics set amid the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon - Call of the Wild and White Fang. A more contemporary account of the difficulties - physical and psychological - posed by early Arctic exploration are offered in the aforementioned Dark Matter, Michelle Paver's 2010 ghost story that follows a 1930s expedition into the heart of darkness of a polar winter. Paver's novel, which is currently being turned into a film by the makers of Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, is in a long line of fiction that imagines there is something malevolent out there in the snow. Fred Schepisi's 1984 thoughtful sci-fi flick, Iceman, depicts a prehistoric man whose body is thawed out of the ice after 40,000 years - a modern-day Frankenstein's monster - misunderstood, frightened and alone. In the 2007 Josh Hartnett movie 30 Days of Night, a small Alaskan town is besieged by vampires, while in the current television series Helix, a team investigates a viral outbreak at an arctic bio-research station, only to discover that genetic boffins are transforming humans in a nefarious way. At the end of the Second World War, one of the more outré theories concerning renegade Nazis was that they had holed up in the Arctic - home of their Aryan descendants according to the mystics of the Thule Society, who believed that blond-haired, blue-eyed Europeans did not emerge out of Africa, but from a long-vanished race of northern supermen (Himmler was, needless to say, a keen supporter of this theory). And when the flying-saucer phenomenon first emerged in the late 1940s, one particularly imaginative magazine editor hypothesised that they were the experimental warplanes of these fugitive Nazis. The frosty tentacles of the Cold War eventually embraced the polar north, too. It was a strange irony of the clash of the two mid-20th century superpowers that while they fought their proxy wars in Africa and South-east Asia, their own landmasses abutted in the Arctic, a short 50-mile hop across the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska. The maps in Dr Strangelove that trace the progress of the intercontinental nuclear warplanes brought home the proximity. A year before Stanley Kubrick's classic satire, Alistair Maclean's adventure novel Ice Station Zebra (filmed in 1968 with Rock Hudson) exploited the public's fascination with nuclear submarines and their ability to sail underneath the Arctic ice. Maclean returned to an Arctic setting with his 1971 murder mystery Bear Island - whose plot was substantially altered in the 1978 film of the same name (starring Donald Sutherland and Vanessa Redgrave), to include one of the earliest storylines involving climate change. What unites all these stories is their sense of the Arctic as a hostile and empty wasteland, visited only by a handful of intrepid European and American explorers. What they tend to ignore is the native Inuit of Greenland, Canada and Alaska, and the smaller Yupik population of Siberia and Alaska. It is a lack that has been redressed in more recent Arctic fiction, most notably in Danish writer Peter Hoeg's inspired 1992 novel Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow, with its spunky eponymous half-Greenlander heroine. In Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner - the first ever feature written and acted entirely in Inuktitut and the top-grossing Canadian movie of 2002 - the action is set in the ancient past and retells an Inuit legend where the monster is an ill-willed shaman. So where are today's yearned-for empty spaces? Space itself? Too remote for anyone except Richard Branson. Cyberspace? Too populous, although some people deprived of their internet might possibly feel like Sir John Franklin as ice entombed his ship. Meanwhile, intercontinental airliners hourly criss-cross the continent, mining companies sniff out oil and gas, satellites map every inch and even middle-income tourists can watch the Northern Lights or take their children to pester Santa Claus. But, as American archaeologist Robert McGhee puts it in his 2007 book The Last Imaginary Place: A Human History of the Arctic World: ""The legend of the Arctic as a distant paradise has been with us since the time of Homer, and a myth of such antiquity will not fade away merely because of the ephemeral reports of a few Arctic explorers, or the scanning eyes of satellites.""

Marriott scoops up delta hotels; $168M deal makes it Canada's largest hotelier,NL,"Where others see doom and gloom for the Canadian economy given the low price of oil and weak Canadian dollar, Marriott International Inc.'s head of mergers and acquisitions saw an opportunity. Marriott is betting on the long-term health of the Canadian economy, announcing on Tuesday an agreement to acquire the Delta brand and become the largest full-service hotel chain in the country. Rick Hoffman, Marriott's executive vice-president of mergers and acquisitions, said the same forces threatening the Canadian economy overall - cheap oil and a weak dollar - have upsides for the tourism and hotel industries. In the short term, Canada is likely to benefit from international travellers taking advantage of cheaper transportation costs and a dollar that stretches farther, Mr. Hoffman said. Meanwhile, in the long term, he believes the country's economic fundamentals are strong. ""Canada is a terrific, solid partner for us and it will be for decades,"" Mr. Hoffman said. ""This is a transaction that will serve us for many, many years."" Marriott plans to acquire Canada's Delta brand, management, franchise business and intellectual property from Delta Hotels Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of British Columbia Investment Management Corp. (bcIMC). The $168 million purchase is subject to regulatory approval and Marriott expects to close the deal in the second quarter of 2015. There are a total of 38 Delta-branded hotels in 30 Canadian cities. Marriott is not planning to acquire the properties themselves, entering into a 30-year management agreement with the hotels owned by affiliates of bcIMC. Gregory Hermus, associate director of the Canadian Tourism Research Institute, said it's a good time to be investing in Canada's tourism and hotel industry. His organization predicts that a combination of lower fuel prices and a weak Canadian dollar will entice Americans to take 200,000 more trips to Canada in 2015, with international visitors taking 150,000 additional trips and Canadians themselves taking 1.1 million more domestic overnight trips. ""It costs less to travel within Canada and now you're a little bit more inclined to stay in Canada as well,"" Mr. Hermus said. ""The only slight blemish might be a weakening of business travel, which is more pronounced in provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland."" Nikhil Bhalla, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets Co. who covers the hotel industry, said the proposed acquisition is part of a savvy strategy by Marriott. The American hotel chain has also recently acquired local hotel chains in Europe and Africa, taking advantage of a strong U.S. dollar and growth opportunities outside the heavily consolidated American hotel market. Mr. Bhalla said in his view, Marriott is right to be optimistic about Canada. He pointed out that tourism isn't the only industry that will benefit from the low price of oil and weak Canadian dollar, with manufacturing and exports standing to benefit as well. ""Even if the economy slows down a little bit, this is only one small brand for Marriott,"" Mr. Bhalla said. ""I think in the big scheme of things, it's an advantage."" cbrownell@nationalpost.com Twitter.com/clabrow"
"DIPPING DOLLAR BAD FOR SNOWBIRDS, GOOD FOR TOURISM",NL,"""Snowbirds"" are being hit hard by the slumping dollar that is making winter stays in the United States and travel abroad more costly. With the dollar slipping below 80 cents U.S., it means the greenback is worth $1.26 in Canadian funds - or about $1.30 with bank and credit card exchange fees. The dollar is closely tied to Canada's resource industries, particularly oil that has fallen to about $45 U.S. a barrel, and a drop in economic activity. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce predicts Canada's central bank will cut its trend-setting interest rate by another quarter percentage point in the next few months, with the dollar bottoming out at 77 cents U.S. The central bank unexpectedly dropped its interest rate to 0.75 percent to stabilize the economy as businesses drastically cut back on exploration and jobs in the Alberta oil patch. A lower dollar, however, aids Canadian businesses whose products are less expensive on the world market as well as tourism to Canada. * * * Canadians to get U.S. Super Bowl ads Canadians have long complained they have been blocked from seeing U.S. ads during the Super Bowl, but that is about to change.

Recent history tells us it's too early for dire predictions; In both 2001 and 2008 indicators portended doom,NL,"Despite headline-grabbing doomsday scenarios about the state of the Canadian economy, the forecast for the small-business climate in Canada can best be described as a good deal gloomier than it was a few months ago. With oil prices hitting recent lows and the loonie trickling downward, there's no denying that the state of the economy is top of mind for small-business owners. Those in the resource rich provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador - whether or not in those sectors - are feeling the negative effects of these rapid changes. While some will take the central bank's recent surprise rate cut as a sign the economic sky is falling, history shows us it's much too early to come to firm conclusions about how big an impact the current oil slump will ultimately have on the economy as a whole. Recall the months immediately following the events of September 2001, when the global economy seemed destined for a hard crash, with some predicting a recession in 2002. CFIB's Business Barometer data on small-business confidence pointed to negative impacts initially, but suggested a big rebound was underway by winter. The economic slump the experts predicted never happened. Or consider the business mood in 2008, with the implosion of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the ""too big to fail"" narrative. Some analysts again predicted a depression on a scale not seen since 1929. Careful examination of the underlying fundamentals contained in Business Barometer told a different tale, equating it to the '90s rather than the dirty '30s. The final economic toll on output and employment turned out to be closer to the former. In both 2001 and 2008, many short-term economic indicators portended doom, and consumers and investors reacted accordingly in the short term by not spending. Yet investment and growth slowly rebounded. While it would be foolish to suggest the current state of affairs is net positive for the economy, it is important to note some of the positives in the current climate. The Business Barometer took a big drop in December, but even at this lower point, small-business fundamentals such as hiring expectations remained reasonably upbeat. The other factor that has yet to show its full impact revolves around new opportunities that cheaper oil creates in the non-oil economy, most notably in manufacturing. Businesses are usually slower to react to good news, but once they do, we would expect at least a partial offset of the negativity in the oilpatch. There are other reasons for guarded optimism: The latest unemployment numbers (6.6%) are nearly the lowest in six years. Of course, this could change, but it's a good starting point. We can't overlook the fact our largest trading partner, the United States, is experiencing an economic comeback after years of recession. This often means more orders for products and services originating from Canadian small businesses. A lower Canadian dollar should also mean a better year for Canada's tourism industry and for retailers who will lose fewer sales to crossborder shopping. There are also positive developments on the legislative front. The recent creation of a federal Small Business Job Credit, resulting in a 15% reduction in EI premiums paid by small business in the next two years, will be helpful for small businesses looking to expand and hire. Add to that a significant reduction in credit card processing fees - and five-year-average rate freeze - for small business starting in April. To help ride out the uncertainty, CFIB members are calling for budget action on several fronts: Lower the small-business tax rate to 9%, from 11%; a red-tape reduction target of 20% in the next three years; and a 50/50 employer-employee contribution on EI premiums. With a federal election looming, we look forward to seeing what all parties will suggest to help strengthen our economy and the role of small businesses in it. Recently, the NDP announced its support of a reduction in the small-business corporate tax rate. Now is not the time for fear or complacency. Canada's small and medium-sized businesses are indispensable to the country's overall economic health, generating almost half of the nation's gross domestic product. As small business goes, so too goes Canada. If we've learned anything from past events, it is that we need to wait and see before assuming the worst. More economic data is needed to gauge short-and long-term effects. Until fourth-quarter GDP numbers are made available in late February, it's too soon to get a true sense of the effect of these trends on the prospects for small business, and the economy as a whole. For small business, the key will be how well and how fast the non-oil economy responds to cheaper oil. Basic psychology suggests people react more quickly to pessimism than optimism, so it will take time to see positive adjustments in the overall economy in terms of employment gains and investment. Should be an interesting year.

British Columbia is in the black,NL,"While most of the country faces a fiscal crunch, a broad economic base and years of restraint will help province buck trend B .C. Finance Minister Mike de Jong on Tuesday will table his third budget. Not entirely by coincidence, it will be the province's third consecutive balanced budget. Mr. de Jong can rightly claim some bragging rights for this budget season, when most of the country is expected to be awash in red ink. “Fiscally, we are the envy of virtually every other province,"" he says. No false modesty here. With the possible exception of Saskatchewan, which may yet squeak out a surplus despite a hit on its oil-sector revenues, B.C. will be the only province that can coast along with modest growth, buffered from the collapse in oil prices that has kept some other finance ministers awake at night. Alberta, which has relied on oil for one quarter of its revenues, is now staring down the barrel at deep spending cuts, higher taxes and a deficit after a $7-billion loss in revenue due to the sixmonth slide in oil prices. Oil-dependent Newfoundland and Labrador, too, will face a fiscal crunch. Ontario can count on growth in the coming year, but still faces a long road to eliminate its $12.5-billion deficit. Mr. de Jong takes credit for his province's good fortune via policies that have supported expanded trade and years of restraint on the spending side. “That's a tribute to, I think, a couple of things: the diversification of our economy, the diversification of our markets and our fiscal discipline we've shown."" There is more to B.C.'s financial state than restraint and a broad economic base, however. Plunging oil prices, the lower Canadian dollar, rock-bottom interest rates and the rebounding fortunes of B.C.'s biggest trading partner, the United States, have all contributed to its good fortune. Mr. de Jong has relished his role as the modern-day “Dr. No,"" however, and will enjoy this moment. He is famously thrifty, still driving his aging Miata sports car with 435,000 kilometres on the odometer. As Finance Minister, he has brought that personal philosophy to shape a $45-billion budget. Standing firm against pressure to spend more on lowincome earners and the province's 300,000 public servants and provide relief to families who are paying more for government services has helped put him in an elite club. “I'm trying to think of a more complicated way to explain saying ‘no,' but I'm not sure there is,"" he said in an interview. “It's something one is inclined to feel proud of, where every other jurisdiction is fighting mounting deficits, a third balanced budget in B.C. is almost old news."" The NDP finance critic, Carole James, says the B.C. Liberal government has arrived at this place at the expense of families. “Who paid for the balanced budget? It's families, it's people who are squeezed, the middle class, people who are working hard,"" she said. “What I hear from people is, ‘When will there be a break for me?'"" Jock Finlayson, chief economist for the B.C. Business Council, is forecasting economic growth for the province of 2.6 per cent in the coming year. He says the B.C. Liberal government's strong emphasis on managing expenditures is “paying dividends,"" although he notes that the previous two budgets contained tax and fee increases worth several hundred million dollars. Over all, the state of the B.C. economy is based on factors outside the legislature's control, he added. “The macroeconomic outlook is reasonably good. … The reasons are largely external to B.C."" One big reason is the cost of oil: The average household in B.C. is expected to save more than $500 annually if prices remain low. That's more than $1-billion in consumer savings, much of it likely to be spent on other goods and services. “Alberta's loss is B.C.'s gain,"" noted Derek Burleton, deputy chief economist for TD Economics. As well, he said, the drop in the value of the loonie will help exports, and lure more tourists. But it helps that the province has already climbed out of deficits, making the most of even modest growth. “Part of it is B.C. is coming from a good starting point."" Here are five things that will shape the B.C. budget:"
"When will the government give tourism the respect it deserves? Tourism contributes billions to the Canadian economy, yet funding has been slashed by half in recent years",NL,"This is a twice-weekly online column highlighting the latest travel news and trends, plus notable destinations. Oil prices are way down. The Canadian dollar is in a slump worthy of the Maple Leafs. This is a historic opportunity for Ottawa to finally address one of this country’s biggest industries: tourism. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was on the stump a few weeks back, talking about how oil is not our only economic tool. He talked about the nation’s manufacturing base, but almost nothing about tourism and travel. I’ve long lamented how tragic our tourism industry is at promoting itself and decried the lack of federal support. In 2002, Canada was seventh in the world for international tourist arrivals. At last count, we were way down at 17th. The Canadian Tourism Commission has had its budget weed-whacked down to a stub, from $105.9-million in 2009 to $58-million in 2014. Nobody in Ottawa has been talking about this – at least not publicly. But recently, Elizabeth May posted a critique (http://elizabethmaymp.ca/news/publications/articles/2015/02/05/harpernomics-101-oil-debt-and-fantasy-math/[http://elizabethmaymp.ca/news/publications/articles/2015/02/05/harpernomics-101-oil-debt-and-fantasy-math/]) of the Harper government, talking about how they spend like maniacs to promote the oil sands but give next to nothing to this critical industry. Tourism employs roughly 600,000 Canadians and, according to the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, generated $84.3-billion in economic activity in 2013. Still, it’s routinely treated as an afterthought, with a series of bumbling, stumbling junior ministers put in charge of a portfolio that cries out for proven ability. It’s great to see May talk about this. I am more encouraged to see someone with an even higher profile weigh in on the issue. That would be comedian Rick Mercer, who recently devoted one of his rants (http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/The+Rick+Mercer+Report/ID/2653261140/[http://www.cbc.ca/player/Shows/Shows/The+Rick+Mercer+Report/ID/2653261140/]) to Harper’s “defeatist” (his word) decision to stop promoting tourism in the U.S., our biggest market. I’ve often wondered why the Tories have failed to capitalize on tourism the way officials have done in New Zealand (they ran with Tolkien mania) and the United States, where the Brand USA campaign has sparked a huge boost. (Not to mention the great job Newfoundland has done, as Mercer points out.) The best theory I can come up with is that Harper feels tourism mostly helps waiters and housekeepers living in cities that tend to vote Liberal or NDP – although one could argue that hotels and airlines are the type of big businesses he would want to protect. I’m not just bashing the Tories here. Tourism Toronto seems to get it, but Ontario’s Liberal government has not done nearly enough the past few years. Perhaps there is reason to hope. With the dollar down and the Pan Am Games on the way to Toronto, maybe the federal government will see tourism as something to help replace the loss of oil income. Tourism is a vital industry in southern Ontario, the No. 1 destination for travellers to our country. The time is right. The need is great. What do you say, Mr. Harper? DESTINATION OF THE DAY: PHOENIX I just returned from a few surprising days in the Phoenix area. I had been before, but this was my first time exploring the city’s bustling downtown. You’ll find tremendous cafés and funky bookstores in and around Roosevelt Row (Ro Ro), just north of the central business district. My favourite watering hole was Bitter and Twisted, a fantastic bar inside a gloriously restored building kitty corner from the sleek Kimpton Palomar Hotel. For dinner, I’d recommend Southern Rail, a lovely restaurant serving everything from fried green tomatoes to duck confit with a Cajun-style risotto, and Sumo Maya for Japanese-Mexican fusion cuisine (somehow it works). On top of that the city was celebrating both Cocktail Week and the Phoenix Gay Rodeo while I was there. See what I mean about surprising?

"Jeremy Charles: Canada’s real top chef; Just as the country’s culinary experts debate the definition of Canadian cuisine, along comes Jeremy Charles, of Newfoundland’s Raymonds Restaurant: one of the ‘humblest, most salt-of-the-earth guys you’ll ever meet – and he’s figured it all out’",NL,"ST. JOHN’S -- This article originally appeared in The Globe and Mail on June 11, 2013. It was last updated on Jul. 14 2013. Derek Dammann, chef at Montreal’s Maison Publique, and chef Jesse Vergen of New Brunswick’s Saint John Ale House – two of the most talented and respected chefs in Canada – were seated at an elegant corner table in a Newfoundland restaurant. They were, as locals might say, in the middle of having a feed. A seafood platter lay between them. This wasn’t, however, the usual basic shellfish-plus-bivalve medley. The platter – a freshly felled cross-section of tree trunk – had arrived bearing delicacies like smoky surf clams stuffed with wild sea greens and chives and salsa verde capelins ensconced within razor-thin shrouds of lardo. The two chefs were incredulous. “This is, by far, the best food in Canada right now,” exclaimed Dammann, a mixture of admiration and surrender colouring his voice. “It’s ridiculous,” added Vergen, not realizing what was still to come – the Acadian caviar, the cod, the grouse, the seal, the moose. Vergen would later describe that tasting menu at Raymonds Restaurant, in downtown St. John’s, as “probably the top meal I’ve ever had in my whole life. In terms of terroir-driven food, nothing even comes close.” For those who haven’t yet tried chef Jeremy Charles’s wild foods at Raymonds: Dammann and Vergen can assure you it’s worth the pilgrimage. By now, Raymonds has won several “No. 1 restaurant in Canada” awards. High-level international chefs have been wowed by Charles’s abilities through his appearances at Cook It Raw events – prestigious gatherings of the world’s top chefs. “Jeremy is easily Canada’s most important chef at this point,” explains chef Daniel Burns of Luksus in New York, who has cooked at Noma, the Fat Duck and Momofuku Labs. All of this buzz (alongside that emanating from nearby Mallard Cottage, run by Todd Perrin) is luring curious diners to Newfoundland. As Dammann states, “I’m positive that what Jeremy and Todd are doing here will make St. John’s the next major food travel destination in the world.” Not bad for a place that, 10 years ago, felt almost bereft of dining options. Sure, Newfoundland had its old standbys – cod tongues, toutons and scrunchions – but nobody would have considered them contenders for the world’s next “it” cuisine. Now, with the rise of nose-to-tail dining, Newfoundland food is finding itself up there with other formerly disdained and now-desirable cuisines such as Roman quinto quarto or traditional British fare. What’s happening at Raymonds Restaurant is more complex – and exciting – than that. They’re certainly using indigenous ingredients and local traditions, but they’re mixing these with a new-Nordic-inspired understanding of how best to transform the bounty around them. Think fresh diver scallops in a sea urchin beurre blanc, or moose charcuterie paired with crispy puffs of lichen. Not exactly salt junk and hard tack. What Charles and his team are doing is not only helping redefine Newfoundland cuisine, but they’re also getting into something more profound – into questions of identity, of what it means to live on the Rock and live off the land and be part of this immense country. “All of us chefs are looking for the identity of Canadian cuisine today,” says Vergen, “and then along comes Jeremy Charles, one of the nicest, humblest, most salt-of-the-earth guys you’ll ever meet, and he’s figured it all out.” Newfoundland cuisine has always been one of necessity, of making do with what nature gives you, and of ingenuity. “Newfoundland has a very distinct culinary tradition that is still very much alive,” explains Ian Mosby, a food historian and L.R. Wilson postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University. “Their cuisine has always been connected to the cod fishery, to isolation and to poverty. Newfoundlanders couldn’t afford to eat many imported foods, so they developed a culture of eating locally available ingredients.” Raymonds is tapping into the roots of Newfoundland cuisine while also elevating it into a highly refined version of itself. A meal at Raymonds is not cheap: A seven-course tasting menu, with wine pairing, is $220 before tax and tip. Those prices are a reflection of the new Newfoundland economy, buoyed by the oil boom. The real forces that conspired to make Raymonds a reality are two Jeremys: Jeremy Charles and Jeremy Bonia, the restaurant’s co-owners and partners. The two had previously worked at Atlantica in nearby Portugal Cove, and they’re intimately connected to Newfoundland. Charles, 36, was born in St. John’s, and much of his youth was spent around fishermen. “My childhood memories are about going down to the wharf when boats were coming in,” he recalls. “I’d be cutting out cod tongues and selling them to the tourists. As a young boy, you tried to get a bit of loot to buy a fishing rod to keep you going for the summer.” Charles often joined his father on hunting and fishing trips, where he discovered his love of working with his hands. “For me, it all began with tying flies – the intricacy of it,” he says. “Whatever you can imagine you can tie onto a hook. There are endless possibilities – kind of like cooking.” His fly-tying approach to the culinary world is part of the reason Charles’s food is so meticulous. “The attention to detail in every dish at Raymonds is astounding,” notes Dammann. “Take that surf clam. Everybody in Canada has access to surf clams, but nobody knows how to cook a surf clam like Jeremy Charles.” Why is that? “Because he’s put so much thought into it.… The execution of technique is always there in every plate. Plus he’s a hunter. Being able to hunt, forage and fish in your own backyard – and serve the things you catch in your own restaurant – basically means he has the advantage over every other chef in North America. He simply has a closer connection to the ingredients he’s cooking than anyone else.” Other chefs can forage, but few of them are legally allowed to serve wild game, as Raymonds can, thanks to Newfoundland’s more understanding laws. Unlike other places (New York, Paris or Montreal, say) that have taken inspiration from the avant-garde foraging movement in Scandinavia, Newfoundlanders actually have access to a dazzling array of readily available Arctic edibles, from beach peas and Scotch lovage on the water’s edge to cloudberries and partridge berries in the barrens. Part of the reason Raymonds has been so accepted locally is the number of foragers, hunters and fishermen working with them. “I’ve turned over a lot of rocks trying to find the people living off the land,” Charles explains. “We’ve made a lot of relationships and are supporting people and encouraging them to support us.” Hunters now know to provide Raymonds with braces of partridge, spruce grouse or ptarmigan. Trappers are out snaring hares for them in the fall. Fishermen bring them their finest snow crab, cod, sea urchin, even seal meat, in season. Newfoundland has been undergoing difficult transitions over the past decades. By forging new ties, Charles is helping certain traditions to stay alive, albeit in an updated guise. Charles’s awareness of what makes Newfoundland unique stems from the time he’s spent abroad, whether cooking in his 20s in Montreal, Los Angeles and Chicago, or with his peers at international conferences, or attending the MAD symposia in Denmark, or making trips to eat at top restaurants like Fäviken – an avant-garde wild-food temple in Sweden. The only way you can know what makes your corner of the world so special is to truly understand the qualities that set it apart. Charles himself is a perfect embodiment of Newfoundland – self-effacing yet knowledgeable, as ahead of his time as he is linked to the past. He did the interview for this piece while returning from a fishing trip in Labrador. He and his friends had been travelling by helicopter, and at one point they dropped down onto a tiny island to forage for some oyster plants, caribou moss “and other lovely shore greens.” Before heading back, they paused just long enough to hack a couple of chunks off a nearby iceberg – for ice in the cocktails they’d make that weekend. One of Charles’s most interesting dishes is his take on cod sounds. The sounds are the cod’s ballast, the part that allows the fish to go up and down in the water. It inflates and deflates, letting them submerge or rise. It’s a part you never find for sale in the rest of Canada. In the past, Newfoundlanders would cook the sounds up in fat. What he and his team decided to do was put the cod sounds in their dehydrator to see what would happen. Out came these translucent, brittle discs. “We tried frying them like chicharrones, and they puffed right up,” Charles recalls. They’d become an entirely new thing, a kind of enlarged, crispy fish chip. “It’s like a Newfoundland nacho,” Charles says, with a laugh. “You add some crème fraîche and shrimp and cod roe and it’s a beautiful, unique thing.” Globe and Mail Update"
Today in History - March 8,NL,"Today in History for March 8: On this date: In 1698, the first meeting convened of the British group which later formed the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, or SPCK Today, SPCK equips Christians throughout the world with financial grants, resources, advice and encouragement. Working with Christian communicators and educators in 60 or more countries, in an average year it supports about 200 projects. In 1702, England's Queen Anne acceded to the throne upon the death of King William III. In 1715, Roman Catholic King Louis XIV announced he had finally put an end to all Protestant practices in France. In 1765, the British House of Lords passed the Stamp Act, a means of raising revenue in the American colonies. In 1775, an unidentified person in Billericay, England became the first victim of a tar-and-feathering. In 1855, a suspension bridge was opened across the Niagara River at Niagara Falls, Ont. In 1867, the British parliament passed the British North America Act. Many MPs were not in the Chamber for final reading, but they rushed in immediately after to vote on a bill to place a tax on dogs. The act received royal assent on March 29 and Queen Victoria set July 1 as the date for Confederation. On this date 115 years later, in 1982, the British Commons passed the Canada Bill for patriation of the Constitution. In 1873, the Northwest Territories council prohibited the sale of liquor. In 1889, John Ericsson, who invented the first successful screw propeller, died. In 1894, New York dog owners became the first in the U.S. to license their pets. In 1907, the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan was established. It was later split into the current Court of Queen's Bench and Court of Appeal. In 1911, fingerprint evidence was introduced as a crime detection tool in a New York City case against a suspected burglar, who was convicted. In 1915, about 10,000 people marched on the Ontario legislature to present a huge petition -- 825,572 signatures -- demanding Prohibition. In 1917, riots and strikes in St. Petersburg marked the beginning of the Russian Revolution. In 1939, Sir Henry Pellatt, the millionaire who built Casa Loma in Toronto, died. He was 80. Pellatt had the castle built between 1911-14 at a cost of $2 million. Based on European designs, it had about 50 rooms and was lavishly decorated. Pellatt suffered financial losses in the 1930s and lost Casa Loma, which is now a tourist attraction. In 1942, ""Transit Through Fire: An Odyssey of 1942,'' the first opera commissioned by the CBC, was broadcast on the network. The music was by Healey Willan, and was orchestrated by Lucio Agostini. In 1945, the first International Women's Day was celebrated. Now celebrated by millions of women around the world, a variety of events are held to celebrate the achievements of women. The symbols for International Women's Day are bread and roses. Bread is for women's struggle for economic equality while roses represent women's continuing efforts for a better quality of life. In 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court, in McCollum v. Board of Education, struck down voluntary religious education classes in Champaign, Ill., public schools, saying the program violated the separation of church and state. In 1950, the Soviet Union announced it possessed the atomic bomb. In 1954, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent visited the Canadian military brigade in Korea during a world tour. In 1965, the United States landed its first combat troops in South Vietnam as 3,500 Marines were brought in to defend the U.S. air base at Da Nang. 1976, four workers were killed and four others injured when a concrete slab fell from the top of Montreal's Olympic stadium. In 1982, the Canada Bill was passed by the British House of Commons by a vote of 177 to 33. The bill was passed on the 115th anniversary of the passage of the British North America Act of 1867. The bill allowed Canada to patriate its Constitution. In 1984, the cruise missile was first tested over Western Canada. The unarmed missile was attached to a B-52 bomber during the 2,500-kilometre flight. In 1984, a lengthy battle over offshore resources ended with the Supreme Court decision that the federal government owned the oil resources of the Hibernia field off Newfoundland. In 1993, the Canadian navy supply ship ""HMCS Preserver'' completed a three-month tour of Somalia. The crews of three Sea King helicopters airlifted 430 tonnes of supplies to the war-torn African country. In 1994, Rogers Communications and Maclean-Hunter struck a deal worth a total of $3.1 billion, to create one of Canada's largest media companies. In 1999, Alice Munro became the first Canadian to win the top fiction award from the National Book Critics Circle for her collection of short stories ""The Love of a Good Woman.'' In 1999, Joe DiMaggio, baseball's Yankee Clipper, whose 56-game hitting streak in 1941 endures as one of the most remarkable records in baseball or any sport, died of lung cancer at age 84. In 2001, the Canadian Navy announced women would be eligible for service on submarines beginning the following year. In 2004, Todd Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks slugged Colorado Avalanche rookie forward Steve Moore from behind and fell on top of him, leaving Moore with a broken neck, a concussion and facial cuts. Bertuzzi, who was suspended by the NHL for the rest of the regular season and playoffs, later pleaded guilty to criminal assault. He received a conditional discharge and was sentenced to probation and community service. Bertuzzi was not reinstated until the start of the 2005-06 season, largely due to the 2004-05 NHL lockout. The hit ended Moore's career and a multimillion-dollar suit against Bertuzzi and the Vancouver Canucks was settled shortly before the start of a September 2014 trial. In 2004, Iraq's Governing Council signed an interim constitution after weeks of wrangling, in a key step towards a planned handover of sovereignty by U.S.-led occupying powers to Iraqis on June 30, 2004. In 2004, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived for a two-day visit to Ottawa. In 2006, the Catholic Church in Ireland admitted that 102 of its priests in Dublin were suspected of sexually or physically abusing at least 350 children. In 2008, near record levels of snow fell in southern Ontario and Quebec, as much as 45 cm in some areas, before moving to the Maritimes, bringing rain, freezing rain and snow. In 2008, Serbia's prime minister dissolved the government and called for new elections after clashing with his pro-Western coalition partners over Kosovo and European Union membership. In 2008, Quebec Liberals voted 97.2 per cent to back Premier Jean Charest as their leader. It was the highest level of support ever recorded by a party leader in Quebec. In 2009, Trooper Marc Diab, 22, from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, died and three other soldiers were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near their armoured vehicle on patrol northeast of Kandahar city in Afghanistan. In 2010, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Vu Pham, 37, was shot and killed after pulling over a pickup truck near London. The suspect, Fred Preston, then became involved in a shootout with two other OPP officers and was critically wounded and died in hospital on March 11. In 2012, Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird travelled to Myanmar to personally confer honorary Canadian citizenship on Nobel laureate and freedom fighter Aung San Suu Kyi. In 2013, the Metis won a landmark case as the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the federal government failed to live up to its constitutional obligations in handing out land to children of the Manitoba Metis in the 1870s. It opened the door for the Metis to negotiate a claim to vast tracts of land in the province, including all of present-day Winnipeg. In 2014, a Malaysia Airlines jet carrying 239 people, including two Canadians, vanished on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Despite a massive multinational search and wide-ranging theories about what might have happened, Flight MH370 has not yet been found. (The Canadian Press)"
"Newfoundland and Labrador premier shuffles cabinet, unelected member out",NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ Newfoundland and Labrador's premier burned up precious political capital last fall when he appointed an unelected neophyte to cabinet only to cut her loose Thursday. Paul Davis thanked Judy Manning for serving as justice and public safety minister as he trimmed his cabinet to 14 from 16 members. Manning, a lawyer and niece of Conservative Sen. Fabian Manning, was a surprise addition when Davis announced his first cabinet Sept. 30 four days after becoming premier. Things have changed since, he said Thursday. A dramatic drop in Brent crude prices has blown a huge hole in the oil-dependent treasury as Davis stares down a $916-million deficit. He is reviewing all government services ahead of a spring budget that's expected to include job and spending cuts. ""We're taking a different approach to government and I think that it's important ... to lead by example.'' Along with Manning, former advanced education minister Kevin O'Brien and Tony Cornect, responsible for Service Newfoundland and Labrador, are out. O'Brien announced Thursday he wants to run federally against Liberal MP Scott Simms in the riding of Bonavista-Gander-Windsor. Cornect said he offered to give up his cabinet post as ""a team player.'' Davis thanked all three and said he hopes Manning would seek the nomination to run for the Progressive Conservatives in an election expected this fall. He said it would have helped if she had agreed to run in one of three byelections held in the weeks and months after her appointment. Manning became a lightning rod for opposition criticism when she said she would wait until the provincial campaign to run in her home district of Placentia-St. Mary's. Davis said Thursday he thought last fall that he'd be hitting the campaign trail this spring. His government's push to cut eight of 48 seats in the house of assembly, a move supported by the Opposition Liberals that's expected to save $2.5 million a year, has delayed that timetable. Manning said in a statement that she is disappointed her public service has ended ""for now.'' She did not commit to running in the next election and could not be reached for comment. Darin King will take over Manning's roles, in addition to serving as minister of business, tourism and culture. The cabinet cuts are expected to save $250,000. Follow bsuebailey on Twitter."
Arctic sea ice reaches record low,NL,"Arctic sea ice has set a new winter record by freezing to the smallest maximum extent in satellite records dating back to 1979 in new evidence of long-term climate change, US data has showed. The ice floating on the Arctic Ocean around the North Pole reached a maximum extent of 14.54m square km on 25 February - an area slightly bigger than Canada - and is now expected to shrink with the spring thaw. ""This year's maximum ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record, with below-average ice conditions everywhere except in the Labrador Sea and Davis Strait,"" the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said in a statement. It said a late-season surge in ice was still possible because of big natural variations. The previous lowest maximum was set in 2011. The ice usually reaches its annual maximum in March and, with the return of the sun to the Arctic after months of winter darkness, shrinks to its smallest in summertime in September. The UN panel of climate scientists links the long-term shrinkage of the ice to climate change and says that Arctic summertime ice could vanish in the second half of the century. The thaw is affecting indigenous lifestyles in the Arctic and making the region more accessible for oil and gas exploration, mining, shipping and tourism."
"How the Maritimes became Canada’s incredible shrinking region; Once-robust region beset by ageing population, diminishing work force and resistance to immigration",NL,"Mireyne MacMillan grew up on a farm about a half-hour’s drive from Charlottetown, near Mount Stewart, which was once a thriving riverside railway stop for travellers to and from the capital. Over the years, the village has boasted two blacksmiths, two garages and a car dealership, the biggest strawberry plant in the Maritimes, a co-op store, two warehouses for potatoes, two fish plants, a movie theatre, a box factory, a handle factory, a dentist and two doctors. At least 50 local residents served in the Second World War. Then the trains stopped running. Today, says Ms. MacMillan, 19, Mount Stewart “is full of a lot of older people.” And “full” isn’t what it once was. According to the most recent census, the 2011 population was a mere 225, a drop of 14 per cent in just five years. Each September, the local high school has more empty seats. Effervescent, ambitious and civic-minded – we chat while she sells cookies on the University of Prince Edward Island campus, to support the swim team – the second-year student in the foods and nutrition program sees no future for herself on the Island. “I’d like to live here,” she says, “but I don’t think I’d be able to get a position. A lot of people I know have already left.” Nor is she likely to put down roots in neighbouring Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. After decades of declining fortunes, the Maritime provinces now find themselves trapped in what one observer describes as “a perfect storm” of economic and demographic decline. The cause of that storm is no mystery; governments have been grappling with it for years. “Everyone knows what the problem is,” says Peter McKenna, head of political science at UPEI. “It’s just that no one knows what to do about it.” Because of their fading economies, PEI, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are running out of people like Mireyne MacMillan. Last year, 1,000 more people left PEI for other parts of Canada than arrived from them. The population of Nova Scotia has been falling since 2011, when it peaked at 948,000; over the next two decades, another 20,000 people are expected to leave. New Brunswick is in similar straits. Between the middle of 2012 and the middle of last year, the population dropped by almost 2,000, to 754,524. But the real problem is the makeup of the population that remains. Every year – due to a weakening economy, a dearth of immigrants, and a population reluctant to face these problems – there are fewer workers to pay taxes and more old people in need of government services. Within five years, a provincial study predicts, the working-age population of New Brunswick will have declined by 30,000, again largely due to the exodus of younger workers, even as 50,000 more people pass the age of 65. A provincial commission in Nova Scotia forecasts that, within 20 years, that province’s working-age population will have declined by 100,000, or about 20 per cent. The trend may seem familiar – “going down the road” to find work is a Maritime tradition – but the tipping point is approaching rapidly, says Marco Navarro-Génie, president of the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, a conservative think tank located in Halifax. “We have an economic crisis on the horizon,” he says. Who will pay for the health care of a population with so many seniors and so few workers? Who will purchase the houses going up for sale? Who will buy the new cars, the appliances, the children’s clothing – all the things that families need when starting out? How far will children have to be bused to the few remaining schools? Such a future can have only one outcome: slashed health care, education and other social services; ever greater departures by anyone able to escape the vortex; rural towns that become ghost towns; growing provincial deficits and debts, along with steadily reduced credit ratings that will increase borrowing costs. Disaster looms unless Maritimers work together to reverse the slide – and, in some respects, adjust their thinking. Prof. McKenna says the Maritimes enjoy strong social cohesion – “You don’t get that sharp polarization” between left and right seen elsewhere in Canada. But there is also a downside: “a particular resistance to change.” A major reason for that resistance, says Donald Savoie of the Université de Moncton, is that “our region, more than the other Canadian regions, remains rural.” Although 80 per cent of Canadians live in cities, about half of the people in the Maritimes reside on farms or in small communities. “New ideas and thinking usually come from urban areas, which are home to universities, innovation and less social and religious pressure,” says Prof. Savoie, a leading authority on public administration and regional development. But his bigger concern involves something else that’s missing: “Our region also lacks the energy, entrepreneurial spirit and the desire for a fresh start that new Canadians bring. We simply do not have enough new Canadians coming to the Maritimes.” Welcome wagon badly needed In other parts of the country, Canada’s aggressive immigration policy is helping to smooth the impact of an aging population. But New Brunswick, with 2.2 per cent of Canada’s population, takes in only 0.8 per cent of the country’s immigrants; Nova Scotia, home to 2.8 per cent of Canadians, takes in just 0.9 per cent of newcomers. Both provinces, in other words, attract about one-third of the immigrants their numbers warrant. And many of those who do come don’t stay. Immigrants avoid the Maritimes because of the lack of economic opportunities and because they tend to gravitate toward communities that already have newcomers. But there are darker reasons, too. A landmark report on Nova Scotia’s future, commissioned by the provincial government in 2012, and released last year, refers to “barriers stemming from negative attitudes and even racism when it comes to welcoming new people into our communities and hiring people ‘from away.’ Carol (she refuses to give her last name) is in her 70s, and sitting with a friend in a food court in downtown Halifax. During lunch hour, she reports, the tables are filled with members of visible minorities. She knows that many are foreign students attending one of the city’s six universities, and most will go home when they graduate. “But some of them will stay and take jobs from people here,” she predicts. Thinking like that is one reason the commission’s report was called Now or Never: An Urgent Call to Action for Nova Scotians. “We didn’t pick the title,” explains Commission Chair Ray Ivany. “The title picked us.” Long-limbed, animated, the son of a Sydney steelworker, Mr. Ivany is president of Acadia University, one of the nation’s finest liberal-arts institutions. He is passionate about the challenges his province faces. “We were not trying to be hyperbolic,” with the title, he maintains, during a conversation in his office on the Acadia campus, in postcard-perfect Wolfville. “The demographic and economic spiral has reached the point that, if we don’t grab hold of the situation now, there is a reasonable question to be posed of whether we can turn it around.” Key to that turnaround, he is convinced, is overcoming the region’s resistance to outsiders, by aggressively targeting and attracting immigrants. That, in turn, will require a change of mindset, both within government and the population. But it can be done. Prince Edward Island has worked hard to recruit immigrants. As a result, the province’s immigration rates are about where they should be, and newcomers now account for about 10 per cent of the Island’s population which, unlike that of its neighbours, has risen slightly, to more than 146,000.Not coincidentally, employment growth in PEI has tracked the national average in recent years, even though it is stagnant in New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia is actually shedding jobs. Fading influence As the belt tightens in the Maritimes, the provinces will make increasingly frantic pleas for federal aid – pleas likely to fall on deaf ears. One reason is fiscal: Ontario is now a have-not province. With almost 40 per cent of the country’s population and economy, it has been receiving equalization payments since 2009. (This year, it will get $2.4-billion.) Every dollar Ontario takes out of the pot is a dollar no longer available to help prop up the Maritimes. Canada now consists of three groups. First, there are the “have” provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, which contribute to the equalization pot. (The latter is included even though it also suffers from high unemployment and outmigration, because of the revenues it now receives from offshore oil and other natural resources – which may say as much about the fairness of the equalization formula as it does about the province’s improving fortunes.) After the haves come the big have-nots: Ontario and Quebec. Bringing up the rear are the small have-nots, the Maritimes and Manitoba. Which illustrates another reason Maritime calls for help may be ignored: Voters there just don’t matter much any more. To blame: Central Canada How did it come to this? The simple answer is, the Maritime provinces were betrayed by the rest of Canada. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick entered Confederation in 1867 (PEI held out until 1873) reluctantly, and with good reason. At the time, the region enjoyed a thriving economy built on trade, mostly with the U.S. Northeast. There were steel mills, cotton mills, sugar refineries, glassworks – a quarter of the new Dominion’s manufacturing capacity. Manufacturing was financed locally, through lenders that evolved into the Royal Bank and Scotiabank. Maritimers’ shipbuilding prowess was world-renowned. Halifax was a major hub on the Atlantic seaboard. Then, in 1879, the federal government imposed the National Policy, creating a tariff wall with the United States in order to protect Central Canadian manufacturing. Suddenly, the nearest market for Maritime goods was Montreal, 1,200 kilometres to the west. Cut off from American markets and far removed from the Canadian heartland, the Maritimes withered into a mostly rural economy dependent on forestry and the fishery, which offered only seasonal work. To protect what jobs were left, governments began throwing good money after bad, propping up money-losing coal mines, paper mills, tourist resorts. “The place hasn’t recovered since,” says Mr. Navarro-Génie. A political scientist, he came east just 18 months ago, after years of teaching in Alberta and a stint at the Frontier Centre in Calgary, another conservative think tank. (As we talk in his suburban office, we both marvel at Halifax’s towering snowbanks – although he loves his new home, Mr. Navarro-Génie, born in Nicaragua, says the winter wind “has a cruel soul.”) In the 1950s, the federal government started pouring money into the region through transfer payments that eventually became the equalization program, along with dubious economic-development schemes. Not only did those schemes mostly fail; they are blamed for encouraging the attitude that government subsidies are better than private investment at creating jobs. A problem with Hail Marys As the decline deepened, economic-development policy increasingly resembled the governmental equivalent of buying lottery tickets. There were spectacular failures, such as the heavy-water plant at Glace Bay, N.S., a 1960s eyesore closed in 1985 and finally torn down in 2013; and New Brunswick’s attempt in the 1970s to jump-start its own auto industry with the gull-winged Bricklin. More recent boondoggles have been smaller in scale, but no less embarrassing. In the 1990s, with the completion of the Confederation Bridge and the rising popularity of golf, the tourism-fixated government of Prince Edward Island invested heavily in places to play the game. But golf waned in popularity, and with losses reaching $500,000 a year, the province put its four courses up for sale in 2007. A year later it wrote off $10-million in bad debts. To this day, the courses remain unsold and are losing $800,000 or more a year. Nova Scotia, meanwhile, is vexed by the Yarmouth ferry. In 2009, the NDP government of the day shut down the money-losing service between the western tip of the province and Portland, Me. But last year, after intense local resistance, the Liberal government inaugurated a new service with a $21-million forgivable loan that was to cover the first seven years of operations. Instead, the money was gone in mere months, and the final tally for taxpayers in 2014 was $28.5-million. This year, the government hopes to lose no more than $13-million on the service. Last month, Globe and Mail readers learned of another Island fiasco – a government attempt to create an international online gambling hub. Insiders, including the provincial conflict-of-interest commissioner, invested in the scheme, which fell apart after two years of covert planning. The tale left a bad taste in the mouths of those who believe that people in the know profit from that knowledge. “It just feeds additional cynicism, exasperates people, and simply turns them away from even trying something new or different,” Prof. McKenna says. A natural-resources conundrum Last fall, Nova Scotia imposed a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas. A review panel convened to examine its economic potential had predicted that fracking would bring at least $1-billion a year into the province and create up to 1,500 permanent jobs. The government decided against it, however, due to native opposition, and worries about the environmental impact. The issue also was a major bone of contention in the New Brunswick election last fall, when the anti-fracking Liberals defeated the pro-fracking Conservatives. Shelley Hippern, who manages a suburban Halifax pet store, cheered the decisions. Exploiting shale gas deposits “might be beneficial to us, and maybe our kids,” she explained, while customers nodded in agreement. “But what about generations from now? We have to look at the bigger picture.” This month, Encana Corp. announced that Nova Scotia’s offshore natural-gas reserves are smaller than previously thought. Industry analysts expect the gas to run out as early as next year, after which the province will have to import gas – at a price perhaps 40-per-cent higher than Nova Scotians currently pay – from the United States. That gas will come from fracked shale in Pennsylvania. At the Université de Moncton, Prof. Savoie argues that the fracking moratorium was the “wrong message at the wrong time,” and sees a connection to Maritimers’ reluctance to embrace change. “Though I do think that some of us have awakened to the challenges, how many of us is not clear,” he says. “I do think that it is much more comfortable to just carry on and hope that something will break in our favour soon.” The word in Truro – the “hub of Nova Scotia” and the home of Stanfield’s underwear – is that Bill Casey will likely win, and that’s the problem. Not for Mr. Casey, of course. Over the years, the affable political veteran has sat in the House of Commons, first as a Progressive Conservative, then as a Conservative, and finally as an Independent. This time, he is running as a Liberal. “I think he’s got a pretty good chance,” predicts Doris Martenstyn, a retired nurse, over a cup of coffee on a street of strip malls and food chains. “People know who he is. And he’s a bit of a renegade.” Recently turned 70, Mr. Casey has been out of politics since resigning his seat in 2009 to become his province’s representative in Ottawa. But now he’s back, and is running as a Liberal because he is impressed by the leadership of Justin Trudeau. In fact, all of Atlantic Canada seems impressed: it is where the Liberals have their widest lead in the polls, currently 52 per cent compared to 23 per cent for the Conservatives and 17 per cent for the NDP. (Except for Newfoundland, the provincial governments are now Liberal as well.) Even though they hold more than half of the federal ridings in the Maritimes, the ruling Conservatives have introduced policies expected to cost them dearly when Canadians go to the polls Oct. 19. While maintaining the equalization program, the Harper government has stripped the equalization component that used to be built into other programs, such as health care and social transfers. Funding is now delivered on a per-capita basis, which seriously disadvantages the Maritimes, with their small, aging populations and disproportionately high health-care needs. As well, the government has tightened the rules for eligibility for employment-insurance benefits, requiring that recipients be willing to travel up to an hour to work, and to accept 70 per cent of their previous pay. This will draw few votes in a region with about 10-per-cent unemployment and where much of the population works in seasonal industries – fishing, agriculture, tourism – and depends on EI the rest of the year. But the loss of support won’t have much influence on the election’s outcome. Population growth in Ontario, B.C. and Alberta has led to the creation of 27 new ridings, plus three in Quebec. Those 30 seats represent five more than in all three Maritime provinces and enough to dilute their representation in the Commons to just 7 per cent. But the region struggles with a much larger political problem: People agree with each other far too much. “I’ve always been a Red Tory,” Mr. Casey explains over the phone. (He has gone south to escape a particularly brutal Maritime winter.) “I believe government should be there to help people who cannot help themselves,” but “I also believe government should be fiscally responsible, too.” Such beliefs are deeply entrenched here in the last bastion of a brand of conservatism that emphasizes state intervention in support of those in need, as a kind of noblesse oblige. However, if the Red Tories are less conservative, the Liberals and New Democrats here are more conservative than elsewhere, which helps explain why New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are reluctant to provide abortion services, no matter which party is in power, and why Nova Scotia MP Peter Stoffer opposed the gun registry even though he is a New Democrat (although he later voted to save it). How to turn things around Despite the severity of the problems facing the Maritimes, there is a way forward – so clear and convincing that Prof. Savoie, Mr. Navarro-Génie and Mr. Ivany all offer solutions that could be summarized as Five Rules for Saving the Maritimes. 1. Maritimers must understand that Ottawa never was and cannot be the solution to the region’s problems. If anything, an excessive reliance on federal support has made things worse. 2. Only a healthy private sector will attract workers, encourage immigration and keep the young at home. Governments must craft policies that encourage businesses large and small to locate, stay and grow. 3. While there are economic opportunities in the rural economy, such as the Annapolis Valley’s burgeoning wine trade, real growth will come from cities. Halifax, especially, could once again be a major hub, and Nova Scotia should target every available dollar at encouraging its growth. By thriving, the city will lift the entire region. 4. Although the notion of Maritime union is deeply unpopular, the provinces must work to eliminate non-tariff barriers to the free movement of people and goods throughout the region, similar to the internal economic union that B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan have fashioned. 5. Most important of all, they must aggressively recruit immigrants, to slow the aging of the population while injecting new energy and ideas. Even though it lost 1,000 people to outmigration last year, PEI wound up being the only Maritime province whose overall population did not decline, due mostly to immigration. Wade MacLauchlan is bullish on the Island’s future, as you might expect from someone who became its premier three weeks ago. “Being small can be big,” points out the former UPEI president, whose Maritime accent may have become more pronounced since he entered politics. By continuing to attract immigrants while fostering a small but growing manufacturing sector, and leveraging the research coming out of UPEI, “we can add a billion dollars to the provincial economy by 2020,” he says. The cost of lost youth That kind of growth could create the jobs that would keep university graduates at home. Until it does, PEI will keep losing young – and suffering the consequences. Mireyne MacMillan, for one, worries not only about her future but that of her father. Robert MacMillan could be forced to give up the family dairy farm. At 56, he needs help with the heavy lifting and doesn’t want to keep his children from their studies. It’s “almost impossible to find young people willing to work,” she says. The more that people like her flee, logic suggests, the harder it will be to convince those who stay behind of the need for radical change. But Ray Ivany doesn’t agree. Asked whether Nova Scotians are scared enough to endure major sacrifices – such as cuts to rural services, so that money can be invested elsewhere – in order to reverse the population drain, the Acadia U president karate-chops the air. “Yes, yes, yes!” he says, predicting that “we are going to look ourselves in the mirror, and we are going to realize there is no one who can solve this except ourselves.” Mr. Ivany foresees a future in which “we have dramatically altered our immigration patterns … we will have increased productivity, we will be trading at considerably higher levels, our resource sectors will be getting more wealth even out of what we currently harvest.” Marco Navarro-Génie isn’t so confident. He believes that the entrenched conservatism of the region will frustrate innovation. As much as he loves his new home, “people don’t want things to change … things are fine the way they are.” But things aren’t fine and, unless Maritimers act boldly to arrest their decline, Mireyne MacMillan and thousands of others will keep going down the road, leaving an increasingly older society in their wake.

WILD THINGS,NL,"A Saturday Travel story on Sable Island incorrectly said 10,000 ships have wrecked on the shoals on the island’s ocean side. In fact, there are more than 350 documented wrecks with an estimate of 10,000 deaths. Sable Island is one of the most fabled outposts in Canada, writes Catherine Bush: a barren strip of land home to 500 feral horses. Ten thousand shipwrecks attest to its perils. But a new cruise means its secrets are more attainable than ever Our Zodiac speeds toward the horizon-spanning strip of Sable Island, 160 kilometres off the Nova Scotia coast. We're approaching the fabled island from its protected side, away from the most turbulent wind and waves. Spray dashes our faces yet it's so idyllically sunny and calm that it's hard to believe we're on the ferocious North Atlantic. We peer ahead, eager to catch our first glimpse of one of the island's wild horses, thrilled to be part of the first tour group to come ashore since the island became a national park reserve in 2013. Someone shouts and points. High on a dune, a lone creature appears in silhouette. Once our boat, one of a dozen or so, reaches land, we leap onto the beach and strip off our wet gear. Out on the water, Adventure Canada's clipper ship, the Sea Adventurer, our home for this expedition, rides at anchor. On shore, our Parks Canada guides give us our instructions. We are not to eat anything, leave anything behind or remove anything, including any beach debris, which must remain in situ because it's being studied. And we are not to go within 20 metres of the 500 horses who call the island home. We set off single file into the dunes and, just over a low sandy ridge, spy a family of horses grazing on a small plain of marram grass. Four mares, still shedding shaggy winter coats, munch with their foals, watched by a stallion with sweeping mane and tail like something out of a teenaged girl's horse fantasy. A dead horse lies nearby, testament to the island's harsh conditions. Ingesting tough beach grass and sand wears down the horses' teeth; they have a lifespan of just four to five years. A second stallion approaches and breaks into a trot, mane rippling across his side. Seconds later, the two stallions rear up in a brief clash before the approaching male backs away. The horses have never seen a group of 100 humans trekking through the dunes. Last year saw only 13 visitors before our June arrival. When the federal government began the process of making Sable Island a park in 2010, Adventure Canada, known for leading expeditions to the Arctic, approached Parks Canada about starting tours to the island. Our visit is a pilot project that will help determine how to manage visitors and keep our presence low-impact. We climb the 28-metre rise Bald Dune, the windy, highest point on the island. From the top, we take in both sides of Sable Island's 1.5-kilometre span and much of its ribbon-like 40kilometre length. A single horse follows a man with a camera across an adjacent ridge. I cannot help wondering what these animals think of us. For years, the horses have lived virtually on their own in family bands, along with the world's largest breeding colony of 50,000 grey seals. A few academic researchers come and go, sometimes staying for a month or so at a time. Environment Canada has a small manned weather station and now four Parks Canada employees live in a cluster of wooden houses in the middle of the island. Supplies arrive by boat and plane. An old Department of Fisheries research station at the east end has already been taken over by shifting sands. Technically, the horses are not wild, but feral: The original population came from Acadia, brought to the island as a commercial venture in the 18th century. In 1959, after a particularly harsh winter, the Canadian government decided to remove the horses and turn most into pet food. Children from across the country – and around the world – wrote letters to thenprime minister John Diefenbaker, begging him to leave the horses on the island. He did, and wrote their protection into law. One of those letter writers is on this Adventure Canada expedition, eager to see the animals she helped save, as is a woman who has made it a goal to travel to islands that harbour wild horses. (She's already been to Virginia's Chincoteague, where the famous children's novel Misty of Chincoteague is set.) Others have been tugged by different versions of the Sable Island mystique. A cartographer for the Nova Scotia government hopes to draw on historic lore and create more place names than the seven that exist for a landscape where the sandy topography changes constantly. Some say that tourists should not be here at all. Anyone who visits must register with Parks Canada, receive approval and go through mandatory on-shore orientation. Camping is not permitted. On this trip, we come ashore for a few hours at a time and spend our nights moored offshore on the 118-passenger Sea Adventurer. The remoteness and difficult weather do their part to keep visits to a minimum. Our second day dawns fogshrouded and it looks as if we won't leave the ship at all. Late afternoon, the clouds part just enough for our Zodiac drivers to steer us ashore by GPS. Someone remarks how Sable Island is celebrated on placemats and posters across the Maritimes as the “graveyard of the Atlantic."" Ten thousand ships have wrecked on the shoals on the island's ocean side, and as we vanish into fog en route to an invisible island, I understand how easy it is to lose all sense of direction. Once ashore, we hike through misty hummocks and dips where horses graze. Science writer Jay Ingram, one of the expedition's resource staff, remarks that it feels as if we have been dropped into a geological era before the advent of humans. Tiny wild strawberries grow here, along with blueberries, cranberries and bayberries. Ipswich sparrows dart among the shrubs. We pass a murky pond, its surface decked with water lilies, the surrounding dirt a sea of hoof prints. The horses dig down through the sand to find fresh water, which floats underground above the deeper saltwater. On the far side of the island sits a great sand plateau – once a freshwater lake that has dried up as sand encroached. Where the sand meets bracing breakers, lolling grey seals raise their heads like periscopes to watch us curiously. Parks Canada manager Jonathan Sheppard considers the island a testament not to fragility but tenacity. Visitor management takes place against a backdrop of other issues: the loss of fresh water, long-term sea-level rise due to climate change, the carrying capacity of the island for the growing horse population. Oil and gas exploration takes place outside a 1.6kilometre exclusion zone; a platform hovers on the horizon. Another reminder of human encroachment is the detritus that washes ashore after its own form of global travel: coconuts, dry-cleaning plastic, a crate of Gucci perfume. On our final shore trip the next day, we meet the remarkable Zoe Lucas, who probably knows more about the island than anyone and is the closest thing to a full-time resident, and wise elder, that Sable Island has. No one can live in a national park reserve but Lucas, who has a researcher's permit, has been grandfathered in and given permission to stay for months at a stretch. She has done so since she first came to Sable Island as a young woman in the early 1970s to cook for a research team. Lucas, a volunteer research associate with the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, studies the horses and the island's habitat, often for researchers who can't make it to the island, and now for Parks Canada. In the years before digital photography made access to photos easy, she learned to identify individual horses by the underside of their hooves. Apple-cheeked, a paisley scarf around her neck, she tells us the two stallions that we saw joust were once companions until one bested an older stallion for the mares. She kneels to sketch a horse in the sand. The next morning, the sun shines again but the wind has risen. It is too dangerous to attempt a landing. With three visits over three days, we have been far luckier than many researchers, who wait days in vain for fog to clear. As the Sea Adventurer pulls away and the island recedes, the fact that we set foot on it at all feels all the more astonishing. Catherine Bush's most recent novel, Accusation, is now out in paperback. She travelled as a guest of Adventure Canada; it did not review or approve this article. IF YOU GO Adventure Canada's Sable Island expedition departs from St. John's. The nine-day itinerary includes three days in the vicinity of Sable Island, travel through the marineprotected region known as the Gully, which is rich with aquatic and bird life, and various whale species, plus a stopoff on St. Pierre, the tiny French colony off the Newfoundland coast. Fine weather also afforded us a half-day in Francois (pronounced Fransway), a cliffside Newfoundland village only reachable by boat. Hiking on Sable Island isn't rigorous, but you need to be in good shape. Tour prices start at $2,395 (U.S.). The next Sable Island cruise will run June 11 to 19, 2016. Flights to St. John's are not included. adventurecanada.com You will likely want to overnight in St. John's before boarding the expedition vessel. Adventure Canada offers a reduced rate for trip members at the Delta, but you might also try the delightful B&B;, the Chef's Inn on Gower Street. thechefsinn.ca"

"Slump in Oil Prices Could Drag Calgary, Edmonton into Recession",NL,"The slump in oil prices is altering the economic pecking order among Canada's major cities, pushing cities in oil-rich Alberta from the top to the bottom, the Conference Board of Canada says. The Ottawa-based think tank says Calgary and Edmonton, which have led Canada's cities in growth over the last several years, will fall into recession. Oil is Canada's biggest export and the big drop in prices for that commodity is expected to be a net negative for Canada's economy. But oil production is concentrated in the western provinces and in offshore drilling in the Atlantic off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. As a result, those areas are much more vulnerable to the economic pressures created by lower oil prices, while the manufacturing-oriented economies of central Canada could benefit from lower oil prices, particularly if they boost consumer spending. The Conference Board forecasts the economies of Calgary and Edmonton will shrink by 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively, in 2015. ""The energy sectors in both cities will decline, but other sectors will also feel the pinch from lower oil prices, including construction, transportation and warehousing, and wholesale and retail trade,"" it says. The Saskatchewan cities of Regina and Saskatoon, also exposed to the energy sector, but not to the same degree, will suffer slowing growth rather than outright contraction, it says. For instance, it predicts that after posting gains of more than 6% in five of the past six years, Saskatoon's growth will slow to a post-recession low of 1.8% in 2015. Prospects are much brighter elsewhere. Toronto, Vancouver, and the east coast city of Halifax will be the fastest growing metropolitan economies in the country this year, with each posting growth of 3.1%, the board predicts. The Toronto area's manufacturing and transportation and warehousing sectors will benefit from stronger U.S. demand and a weaker Canadian dollar. ""Toronto can also expect a boost in tourism activity when the region hosts the Pan Am/Parapan Am Games this summer,"" the board adds. The Conference Board anticipates that widespread gains across all sectors of its economy will boost Vancouver's growth. At the opposite end of the country, Halifax's manufacturing sector is expected to see a big increase in output this year, as production begins on the first set of new vessels for the Royal Canadian Navy.

"Toronto will be top economic performer in 2015, report says",NL,"Toronto’s economic growth will top that of its Canadian peers for the first time this century, thanks to a weaker Canadian dollar and a strengthening U.S. economy, a new report says. The city’s economy grew at its fastest pace in four years in 2014 and is predicted to expand again by 3.1 per cent this year, according to The Conference Board of Canada’s Metropolitan Outlook: Spring 2015 report. “For the first time since 1999, Toronto will boast the fastest growing metropolitan economy this year among the 13 cities covered in this edition of our report,” said Alan Arcand, associate director of the Centre for Municipal Studies. Toronto’s growth was boosted by gains in the manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and retail trade services, sectors that are expected to improve again in 2015, Arcand said. The city’s manufacturing output is poised to grow by 2.8 per cent, the sector’s fifth gain in six years. Renewed strength in the global economy, low interest rates, falling oil prices and a weaker loonie have helped increase demand for products manufactured in Toronto, the report said. The construction sector, which has seen declines in the past two years, is also expected to expand 3.8 per cent in 2015 due to rising housing starts and the growth of downtown condominiums. Meanwhile, consumer spending in Ontario is also predicted to climb with a return to positive employment growth and the upcoming Pan Am Games lifting the province’s tourism activity. Ontario’s export industry remains robust, according to the report, mainly because the U.S. economy, which buys nearly 80 per cent of the province’s exports, is rapidly expanding. The Canadian dollar’s slide against its U.S. counterpart is also helping Ontario’s competitiveness, the report states. Nationally, however, the outlook is far from bright. Plummeting oil prices are hitting Canada’s economy hard, with the impact in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador resulting in another year of unimpressive economic growth nationwide. The sharp drop in oil prices will cost producers more than $40 billion (U.S.) in lost revenue, the report said, but growth in other regions, such as Toronto, is predicted to offset the negative impacts."
Jobless Benefits Surge in Canada's Oil-Patch Provinces -- Market Talk,NL,"16:59 EDT - Anyone looking for more evidence that Canada's oil-producing provinces are feeling the sting of lower oil prices can look to a piece of data that doesn't typically get a lot of attention: monthly employment insurance numbers. BMO Capital Markets notes that claims in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador surged again in March, reaching the highest level outside the recession--and getting close to recessionary levels as well. Alberta's total rose 8.9% in March to 38.8K, the fifth consecutive monthly increase. In Saskatchewan, the number of people receiving jobless benefits rose for the fourth consecutive month, up 3.8%, while in Newfoundland and Labrador it rose 2.2%, continuing an upward trend that began last November. (don.curren@wsj.com; @dbcurren) 2056 GMT - News the New Zealand government will implement a passenger levy of NZD$22 for a return international trip ""could impact New Zealand's competitiveness as a tourist destination,"" says Auckland Airport. It's ""regrettable"" that the implementation of this new tax happens at a time when the tourism industry is starting to experience solid growth, following many years of average performance, it says. The government announced a levy to fund passenger-related biosecurity and customs activities at the nation's borders. The new Border Clearance Levy is expected to take effect Jan. 1 next year and, subject to consultation, will be around NZ$16 for arriving passengers and around NZ$6 for departing passengers.

Two beta thalassemia patients remain free of blood transfusions 11 and 14 months after a single administration of the treatment.

CMHC warns of housing slowdown; Oil-dependent provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan will see the lion’s share of the damper on demand,NL,"After years of tolerating sky-high house prices, Canadian buyers are set to start flocking to more affordable homes and many others will opt to keep renting instead, helping to take more steam out of the housing market, the federal housing agency predicts. New-home construction will slow over the next two years as low oil prices continue to take their toll on the economy despite rock-bottom interest rates, Canada Mortgage and Housing Agency said in a new housing-market forecast. Prices of resale homes will rise 3.4 per cent this year before slowing to 1.5 per cent next year. Oil-dependent provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan will bear the brunt of the slowdown in the market, CMHC said. Home prices will fall below the national average in Alberta as oil settles around $50 to $60 (U.S.) a barrel this year. Outside of Western oil economies, much of the expected slowdown reflects the shifting preferences among buyers, who had been flocking to high-priced newly built detached homes in the past year, but who may start looking toward older entry-level resale homes and more affordable new builds, such as townhouses and condos, where ample supply has kept prices from rising too quickly. That will be particularly true in expensive markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, where CMHC expects rising mortgage rates next year will put a damper on demand for detached homes. “As mortgage carrying costs continue to grow, particularly for single-family homes, demand will increasingly shift to more affordable housing,” said Ted Tsiakopoulos, CMHC’s regional economist for Ontario. Both cities are likely to see rising demand for rental apartments among buyers priced out of the housing market. In Toronto, the affordability crunch is likely to lead to a surge of new construction in rental-apartment buildings and new condo projects being turned into rentals instead, according to a new report on Toronto-area residential development by real estate services company Colliers International. In Vancouver, where land prices are still too high to justify building rental apartments, most new rentals are in the form of “mortgage helpers,” usually detached homes that have basement apartments or a small rental home built in the backyard, known as a laneway house. Roughly 80 per cent of all newly built single-family homes in Vancouver now have some sort of rental suite as part of the property, “effectively making the single-detached homes lower-density, multiple-family dwellings,” CMHC said. Nationally, CMHC expects the average resale home price to range from $402,139 to $439,589 by the end of this year. Reflecting the level of uncertainty among economists about the future of interest rates and oil prices, CMHC says average home prices could fall to as low as $398,191 in 2016 or could rise to as high as $457,200. The federal housing agency also says it expects that mortgage rates will rise slightly over the next two years, with five-year posted rates set to range from 4 to 5.5 per cent this year, rising to 4.2 to 6.2 per cent next year. Provincial forecasts: B.C. Migration, both from other countries and from within Canada, will help sustain B.C.’s already strong housing market over the next two years. Average resale prices will jump 5.8 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2016. Alberta Rising unemployment and a fall in the number of temporary foreign workers will hit Alberta’s housing market. New home construction will slow as low oil prices push Alberta into a buyer’s market. Average resale prices will fall 3.7 per cent this year before rising 1.1 per cent next year. Saskatchewan Unemployment will rise from 3.8 per cent this year to 4.6 per cent in 2016, pushing prices down. Average resale prices will drop 0.7 per cent this year and then rise 1 per cent the year after. Manitoba The province will see some of the strongest economic growth in the country over the next two years, with GDP growing by 2.4 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent the next. Rising wages and immigration will help Manitoba’s housing market, although a recent building boom has meant there’s plenty of listings for buyers to choose from. Average resale prices are expected to rise 1.2 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent in 2016. Ontario Ontario’s economic growth rate will surpass the national average for the first time in a decade, CMHC says, although it will remain below the province’s historic average as businesses boost productivity through investment in new equipment rather than new workers. The unemployment rate will fall slightly over the next two years, but the growing price gap between condos and houses will curb construction of new homes. Average resale price growth will slow to 3.6 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year, down from 7 per cent in 2014. Quebec Cheaper oil prices and a low dollar are starting to have an impact on Quebec’s economy, helping to boost its housing market. Even so, CMHC predicts unemployment will rise slightly and the glut of new homes, particularly condos, from recent years will keep prices from growing too quickly. Average resale home prices are expected to rise 2.4 per cent this year and another 1.9 per cent in 2016. New Brunswick A low dollar and an improving U.S. economy is helping New Brunswick’s export economy. But with unemployment on the rise and the number of homes listed for sale at historically high levels, the province’s housing market is set to remain weak over the next two years. Average resale prices will drop 0.5 per cent this year and 0.6 per cent the year after. Nova Scotia The start of a major federal government shipbuilding contract this year will help boost the province’s economy, but beyond that Nova Scotia’s employment growth is expected to remain slow. Average resale prices have been falling the past two years, but are expected to turn around, growing 0.3 per cent this year and 0.5 per cent the following year. PEI More Canadians will be looking to vacation closer to home thanks to a weaker loonie, which should help P.E.I.’s tourism industry, CMHC said. Despite improving economic conditions, unemployment should rise slightly. The housing market outside of Charlottetown is expected to bear the brunt of slower job growth, with average resale prices falling 1.5 per cent this year and growing by just 0.3 per cent next year. That’s down sharply from the 5-per-cent price growth the province’s housing market saw last year. Newfoundland The province’s housing market will feel the pinch of lower oil prices. Unemployment will likely surpass 13 per cent by next year, CMHC predicts. Home-construction activity will slow, while home prices will likely rise below the rate of inflation. Average resale prices will likely stay flat, growing by just 0.1 per cent this year before rebounding by 1.1 per cent in 2016. Globe and Mail Update"
Liberal MP calls for permanent fix as Ottawa spends $1.7M on oil-leaking wreck,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ Documents showing the federal government spent $1.7 million over the last two years to plug oil leaks from a Newfoundland shipwreck bolster calls for a permanent fix, says a Liberal MP. Scott Simms received the financial update in response to an order paper question and provided it to The Canadian Press. The records outline money spent on remote operated vehicles, aerial surveillance and cofferdams used to trap oil seeping from hull cracks in the Manolis L vessel near Change Islands in northeastern Newfoundland. It ran aground on Blow Hard rock in January 1985 with more than 500 tonnes of fuel oil and diesel on board. It now sits about 60 metres under Notre Dame Bay and has been blamed for leaving bands of oily tar on nearby wharves. Simms said Ottawa needs to stop what he called ""Band-Aid'' efforts and drain the vessel to avert a potential ecological disaster. It sits on the ledge of a subsea mountain ridge where it's exposed to fierce North Atlantic storms. Thick ice covers the surface at intervals in winter and spring. ""The local community depends so much on the environment, so much on the water,'' Simms said from Ottawa. ""The commercial fishery is massive.'' Tourism in the scenic region famously known as Iceberg Alley is also crucial, Simms said. ""There's a great deal of frustration and a great deal of worry,'' he said of his constituents. ""The hull is thin and there's only one device called a cofferdam that is over the two biggest leaks. So before this thing opens up, we need to have a serious solution to permanently take the oil out. We know that can be done from an engineering, technical perspective.'' The coast guard in October 2013 launched a $50-million operation to extract seeping fuel from a U.S. army transport ship, the Brigadier-General M.G. Zalinksi, that sank in 1946 off B.C.'s remote north coast. Simms said it's not known how much the Manolis L would cost. Estimates released by the federal government under Access to Information laws redacted those figures, he said. A spokeswoman said Ottawa is still considering all approaches. ""While the Canadian Coast Guard is confident that its current response plan is effective, we will continue to look at all options to ensure the marine environment is protected,'' Jan Woodford said in an emailed statement. ""Our ongoing response plan involves comprehensive monitoring and a maintenance plan including regular site visits, aerial surveillance flights and scheduled operations to remove any pollution collected by the cofferdam.'' Woodford said the Manolis L hull was assessed earlier this month. ""All containment seals are working properly, and no oil was observed.'' Transport Canada aircraft and coast guard vessels regularly monitor the site from the air and water, she added. Woodford said there have been 38 surveillance flights since last December and no oil has been observed on the water. Residents say the cofferdam strategy failed once already when it shifted and oil escaped in 2013. They've formed a citizens' group and have organized a Facebook campaign pushing Ottawa to drain the wreck. Simms said that may wind up being more cost-effective. ""Instead of paying money every year to have a Band-Aid on it, just do the surgery and remove it.'' Follow bsuebailey on Twitter."

LOCAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS TELL A NATIONAL STORY,NL,"It is often said that Canada has no national housing market, only a series of local markets, each reflecting its own unique circumstances. That may be true, yet no housing market in the country has been immune to the reversal of fortunes in Canada's economy over the past year. A slowdown in the oil patch has hit housing markets in Saskatchewan and Newfoundland. Government belt-tightening ahead of a federal election has kept Ottawa's market in the doldrums. Meanwhile, as low interest rates push prices in Toronto and Vancouver into the stratosphere, buyers are turning to smaller, more affordable markets in Ontario and British Columbia. Real estate reporter Tamson McMahon explores six local markets that may not often garner national headlines, but have their own stories to tell about the country's changing economic conditions 10.4% Squamish, B.C. When Matthew Spitzer bought his two-bedroom condo in Squamish, B.C., three years ago, the home had been in foreclosure for months and Mr. Spitzer snapped it up for a bargain. But as he found out when he sold his condo last month, just days after putting it on the market, Squamish is quickly losing its reputation as the small, sleepy pit stop on the road between Vancouver and Whistler. As detached houses in Vancouver skyrocket out of reach of most buyers, young families are venturing further afield in search of affordable housing. Many are making the drive north along the Sea to Sky Highway to Squamish. Home sales in the community of nearly 18,000 were up 58 per cent in May compared with last year, the local real estate board reported. Average resale prices in the community have jumped 10 per cent to nearly $450,000, while detached homes have soared more than 20 per cent. Much of that growth is being fuelled by buyers trading their condos in Vancouver for detached houses in Squamish. In Valleycliffe, a family-friendly neighbourhood that's at the first highway exit toward Vancouver, prices have soared by $100,000 in the past two months alone, Squamish Realtor Brian Loverin says. For an extra $40,000, Aaron Hall and his young family traded a townhouse in Burnaby for a 2,200square-foot, four-bedroom house in Squamish with a view of the mountains and a swimming hole in the backyard. “It's still affordable for a young family who doesn't own anything to try to get into the market,"" said Mr. Hall, whose children are one and three. His commute to Vancouver, where Mr. Hall works in the film industry and his wife Beki is a pharmacy technician, takes 40 minutes and is traffic-free. “It's probably one of the nicest commutes in the world,"" he said. “I literally get goosebumps driving home, with the sun setting over the islands and ocean."" Upgrades to the Sea to Sky Highway for the 2010 Olympics and a new gondola that opened last year are attracting both commuters and tourists. Proposals for a new liquefied natural gas terminal and a four-season resort, while controversial, bring the promise of new jobs and more visitors. Already, the community is experiencing a building boom, including houses with Vancouver-style prices. In Crumpit Woods, a new subdivision marketed toward high-end buyers, builders are marketing houses with $1-million price tags. All that change, coupled with a hot real estate market, convinced Mr. Spitzer, 28, that it was time to move on. He recently bought a house in Agassiz, B.C., nearly three hours away. “I was able to get a three-bedroom with a yard for $300,000, and you really can't find that here any more."" 3.2% Edmonton Unlike its sister city, Calgary, Edmonton's housing market hasn't felt quite the same pinch from falling oil prices. Sales rose 2.4 per cent in June and prices were up 2 per cent from a year earlier. Yet, while housing prices have so far avoided a crash, Edmonton has witnessed a different type of housing-market phenomenon this year: a boom in rental-apartment construction. Developers began construction on nearly 4,300 multifamily houses in the first three months of the year, almost three times more than during the same period last year. By April, there were more than 2,600 rental apartments under construction in Edmonton. In total, the city is expected to see 10,000 new rental apartments and condos built this year and last. Many were conceived years ago, when oil prices were high and Edmonton had one of the lowest vacancy rates in the country. Between 2009 and 2014, the vacancy rate plunged from 4.9 per cent to just 1.7 per cent. That pushed up rents in Edmonton faster than any other city in Canada last year, real estate brokerage Colliers International said, with average rents rising $89 each month. By late last year, the city was tied with Toronto as the country's second-most expensive housing market, behind only Calgary and Vancouver. “Last year, I'd personally get phone calls from high-school [friends] I haven't seen for over 30 some years, panicking to find apartments for their children in Calgary and Edmonton going into university,"" Sam Kolias, chief executive of Boardwalk Real Estate Investment Trust, a major Alberta landlord, told analysts in May. Soaring rents caught the attention of institutional investors, particularly pension funds, many of whom were looking to bulk up their rental portfolios. Land was cheaper in Edmonton than in Calgary and new developers rushed into the market, while others shelved plans to build condos and partnered with investors to build rentals instead. There were nearly more than 2,200 new rentals built in the city last year, higher than in previous years but a small drop in the bucket of the city's 67,000-unit rental-apartment universe, Boardwalk president Rob Geremia said. Rental construction can take decades before it turns a profit, so most landlords are in the market for the long term, he says. Still, the surge of new supply, coupled with the province's economic slowdown, have taken the steam out of Edmonton's rental market. The vacancy rate rose from 1.7 per cent last fall to 2.4 per cent today. Rental growth has slowed down and apartments are taking longer to fill. Boardwalk has begun offering incentives such as smaller security deposits and discounts off rent to attract new tenants, which has helped keep its occupancy rate in the city at 98 per cent. “It's real tough right now, but that's life,"" Mr. Geremia said. “You have to develop and you can't always have a good time. The real question that we need to answer – and no one can – is how long oil prices will stay where they are."" 1.7% Regina When federal housing watchdog Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. warned that several Canadian housing markets were at risk of a correction, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary weren't on the list. But Regina was. The city's housing market has benefited enormously from soaring prices for oil, potash and other commodities, sailing through the global financial crisis comparatively unscathed. Prices leapt more than 50 per cent between October, 2006, and June, 2008, alone. Real estate speculators moved in, snapping up derelict buildings in the city's impoverished North Central neighbourhood by the dozen, often leaving them vacant while waiting for prices to keep on soaring. “I remember thinking at the time that these aren't going to come back on the market at the same price,"" Regina real estate broker Mike Duggleby said. That fuelled a spike in new construction, particularly among condos aimed at first-time buyers, many of which were originally planned during the boom years but came onto the market just as prices began slowing over the past few years. The number of homes listed for sale has hit a 20year high, says Gord Archibald, CEO of the Association of Regina Realtors. Average house prices are about 10 per cent lower than peak levels and have fallen 3 per cent since last June. Regina's economy has been hit by slumping prices for oil and potash. The city is home to a large refinery, and international oilfield-services giant Halliburton Co. announced in February it was closing its Regina office. That has hit the rental market particularly hard. Vacancy rates have jumped across Saskatchewan from 3.3 per cent last year to 5.6 per cent this year. For rental landlord Boardwalk REIT, first-quarter results in Regina “weren't pretty,"" Mr. Geremia said. “We're now seeing pretty major corrections in Regina."" Some think the market reaction is overwrought. Regina still boasts an enviable 4.6-per-cent unemployment rate, higher than in previous years but still stronger than many other Canadian markets. Realtor James Wruth figures buyers have been scared off by the swift change in the market from bidding wars to a surplus of unsold listings. “The fact that buyers have plenty of homes to choose from, lower interest rates and lower prices, but still aren't making an offer, makes me scratch my head sometimes,"" he said. 4.8% Windsor, Ont. If Calgary's housing market serves as a proxy for the health of the country's resource industry, then Windsor's real estate market is perhaps the best gauge of the strength of Canadian manufacturing. The Southwestern Ontario city's work force was hard-hit by the global financial crisis, which sent North American auto makers scrambling for government bailouts. The economic downturn came on top of a steadily appreciating Canadian dollar that helped to bleed jobs to cheaper markets to the south. Windsor's housing prices took a similar beating, falling more than 6 per cent from 2006 to 2009, in what was already among the country's cheapest housing markets. These days, Windsor appears to be in the midst of a remarkable turnaround. House sales were up nearly 30 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Average resale prices are up 5 per cent from last June, making the city one of Canada's hottest markets. “Any decent home is selling fairly quickly and is getting multiple offers,"" Windsor real estate broker Gary Barbesin said. “A lot of them are going over the asking price."" Windsor's housing market is being helped by a trifecta of favourable economic developments: lower interest rates, cheaper oil prices and a falling loonie. The resurgent North American automotive market has also helped. Tool-and-die shops are staffing up and the local Chrysler assembly plant recently reopened after a major retooling. Many of the workers in the skilled trades who had been sitting on the fence over fears their jobs could be cut or hours scaled back are starting to return to the market. “My clients that are working in the factories, it seems like they can get all the overtime they want,"" Windsor mortgage broker Brad Carr said. “If you've got a skill or you're an engineer, you can kind of write your own ticket right now."" Mr. Carr has also seen an increase in out-of-town investors looking to buy property in what remains one of Canada's most affordable urban markets. Yet, there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about whether the jump in house sales in Windsor is really a sign that the city's economy is in the midst of a resurgence. The housing market has seen its share of false starts in the past. Commercial and industrial real estate sales have picked up, Mr. Barbesin says, but not nearly at the same pace as the housing market, and the city still faces a glut of vacant office space. “It's certainly not that more jobs have come into town,"" he said. Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic points out that home listings have fallen to among the lowest in a decade. The shortage of homes for sale is helping to drive up resale prices. Still, Mr. Carr thinks this time the housing market may have finally started to turn a corner. “Windsor went through its real estate correction years ago and now I think we're one of the safer markets in Canada,"" he said. 1.8% Ottawa When Finance Minister Joe Oliver announced that the Harper Conservatives had balanced the federal budget for the first time in eight years, many economists and voters cheered. But budget cuts have been bad news for those looking to sell their homes in the national capital's moribund housing market. “It's actually a bit of a conundrum,"" said Brian Johnston, chief operating officer of Mattamy Homes, one of the city's biggest house builders, in a May interview. “I think Ottawa is very much a onehorse town – the federal government – and the federal government is basically taking the view that we're not going to allow government to grow."" The federal public sector shed nearly 25,000 jobs between 2011 and April of last year, Treasury Board records show. The office of the Parliamentary Budget Officer has estimated Ottawa is poised to shed another 9,000 public-service jobs by 2017. Many of those job cuts have been centred in Ottawa, helping to put a chill over the city's housing market. New-house sales plunged 25 per cent in May compared with a year earlier, according to building-industry analyst PMA Brethour Realty Group. Resale-house prices have fallen more than 6 per cent since last August, although the market rebounded in May and June. Public-sector relocations, which account for roughly 10 per cent of the city's housing-sales transactions, dried up last year, driven by fewer transfers in and out of the city for National Defence and RCMP employees, real estate broker Gord McCormick says. “Last year was a very tough year for the government relocation market and that definitely had an impact on us,"" he said. The city is also grappling with a surge in newly built condos that have been flooding the market, which has kept condo prices flat over the past year. Mr. McCormick estimates it would take more than a year to sell off all the condos now listed on the market. Ottawa has witnessed the same condo boom being felt in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, but without the high levels of immigration to support it. Developers have since shifted plans to build smaller in order to appeal to a more price-conscious buyer. 4.1% St. John's It may come as a surprise to many Canadians that for several years the hottest resource economy in the country wasn't Calgary, but St. John's. Propelled by a boom in offshore oil development and billions in mining and infrastructure investments, the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador has grown roughly 50 per cent since 2000. Jobs and wage hikes quickly followed. Investors from other provinces and as far away as Ireland poured into the market, buying up dozens of houses at a time for rentals. Housing prices boomed, more than doubling since 2000 and rising 25 per cent in one year through 2007 and 2008. “It's like Newfoundland had to catch up to the rest of Canada, but they did it in just 10 years,"" St. John's real estate broker Teri-Lynn Jones said. Such furious growth was bound to come to an end eventually. Softening prices for oil and other commodities have slowed the province's economic growth. Rural areas outside St. John's have seen the return of workers from Alberta. Economists are calling for the province to slip into recession this year. Unemployment hit 13.8 per cent in May, the highest level since 2010. Mines have closed, while the bulk of construction has finished on several major infrastructure projects, meaning less demand for construction workers. Several restaurants have shut down and the closing of Target and Future Shop have left an abundance of retail space. The slowdown has effectively cooled the city's overheated housing market. The volume of resalehousing sales across Newfoundland fell 5 per cent in May compared with a year earlier, while average prices dropped 4.6 per cent. “The heat went out of the market,"" Realtor Glenn Larkin said. “Multiple offers have slowed down. We were down to where homes were selling in a week. Now, we've gone back to a normal market, where you put a house for sale and 60 to 90 days later it sells."" The resale market is being supported by first-time buyers, who make up about half of the St. John's market, Ms. Jones said. Many have been able to find good jobs after graduating from university, helping to slow the outflow of young workers to other parts of Canada. But the market is also grappling with a surplus of expensive, newly built homes aimed at move-up buyers; many started when property values were soaring. Builders have begun offering incentives to move a glut of new supply. “If you need to sell your current home first, don't worry about it – the builder will buy it,"" reads an ad for Southlands, a new development of executive homes."
Canada's call of the wild: Newfoundland offers up rugged landscapes and startling wildlife,NL,"It's surprisingly easy to access - just remember to pack for all conditions... If there exists another group of islanders whose preoccupation with the weather is greater than that of the British, then perhaps I have found them. Jutting out into the cold North Atlantic Ocean, pointing towards Ireland – the country from which so many came here to make their home during the last century – is Newfoundland. And the island’s weather, from one day to the next, is anyone’s guess. Local television forecasts are as detailed as the news segments that precede them, and conversations about it can be heard everywhere you go – there are a dozen descriptions for rain: soft rain; a hail of rain; gentle rain; blessed rain – and of course the favourite for when things get really wild: wet rain. For the British tourist who has made what feels like just a short hop from the UK, this may sound familiar, but it’s a lesson in what to pack for even a summer jaunt – everything. Fortunately, when I arrive, spring has just sprung, evident in the delicate pink of the wild rhododendrons interspersed among the endless spruce. It’s 25C and out to sea several icebergs are glistening in the sun. A lack of strong wind has kept them out of the harbours, rather than blowing them inland, where they would float silently, waiting for fishermen to navigate skillfully around them. Newfoundlanders – or Newfies as they’re known – are proud of their icebergs. So much so, they even “harvest” them to make the region’s most popular brand of craft beer – unsurprisingly called Iceberg. On a tour of Quidi Vidi brewery in St John’s, the province’s capital, I’m told the water used to brew the beer is the purest and cleanest on earth. It is ingenuity such as this which kept Newfoundland, the last province to join Canada in 1949 (it officially became Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001), alive when a fishing moratorium took away hundreds of thousands of livelihoods overnight, in 1992. With the discovery of off-shore oil much of the province has gradually become prosperous. Just a five-hour flight from London, St John’s is small and intimate. There’s a San Franciscan vibe to the old part of town, whose steep slopes down to the harbour are lined with jelly-bean coloured Victorian panel-board houses. Like the Californian city, St John’s has also risen from the ashes – after three devastating fires it was rebuilt from scratch each time. There is a strong artistic community here, too, evident in the abundance of galleries, art shops, and the large number of artists who have made the province their home. Wide awake at 6am, I begin the short but steep walk up to Signal Hill. The small fort sits atop a hill overlooking both the city and the Atlantic coastline, and on clear days visitors come here hoping for a glimpse of breaching whales. They decide not to put in an appearance for me, but on this beautiful, crisp morning, the view is still pretty stirring. Heading back into town, I breeze past most of the knick-knack stores along the main Water Street, stopping only to pop into Fred’s. I can’t resist this purple-painted independent record shop. It’s been a local institution since 1972, and with stripped wooden floors, band T-shirts hanging from the walls and tightly crammed records, it’s like being on the set of Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity. I easily while away an hour thumbing through the vinyl. Yet, like most visitors to Newfoundland, I soon have itchy feet to see the great wilderness. Just an hour or so drive north up the coast brings me to Brigus. This sleepy, historic settlement, which rests by the shoreline surrounded by rock bluffs, was once home to US artist Rockwell Kent, until his eccentric behaviour led him to be thrown out of the town – it was the First World War and the locals thought he was spying for the Germans. Further along up the coast lies tiny but beautiful Port Rexton. Here I base myself at Fishers’ Loft, a cosy inn tucked away on the top of a hill, to explore the Skerwink Trail. An easy but stunning 5.3km coastal loop, the Skerwink begins on flat grassland near the inn. But within 1km, through a section of black spruce and a sudden drop, the coastline comes abruptly into view. Rock stacks, dramatic sweeping cliffs and rugged coves dominate the rest of the walk until it turns back inland. Earlier in the season you can iceberg watch, while in summer there are whales to spot, but for now I make do with the stunning scenery. Keen to see some wildlife, I head back south along the coast to the town of Elliston, known as “the root cellar capital of the world” (having never seen or heard of a root cellar before, I’m confident in believing the claim). These cellars, with their little doors in the hillsides, look like hobbit houses. They were once used to keep vegetables from rotting during the harsh winters. They’re not why I’m here though – a short walk through the pretty but exceptionally quiet town is Elliston Puffin Site. The puffin is the official bird of Newfoundland and Labrador, and around 300 nesting pairs make their home here from May to September. Setting down my camera bag on an outcrop, I look through the lens and see only gulls. “Be patient,” says my guide, Andrew. “Look for the holes in the ground.” Zooming in closer, sure enough, within a few minutes the distinctive black and white head pops up, with its bright orange and yellow bill and apprehensive look (perhaps caused by unease with their bedfellows, the gulls). They’re engaging to watch, largely due to the fact they’re not the most gracious of creatures. Poor fliers, they have trouble becoming airborne, and when they land they often crash, sending other puffins flying like skittles. Heading back to St John’s, the weather closes in and storm clouds gather. “Is that a hail of rain or blessed rain?” I ask Andrew. “Oh no, that’s definitely wet rain,” he chuckles.

I's the b'y who eats the cod: Fiorito,NL,"We travelled recently beyond the GTA and did not fall off the edge of the world; instead, we return with the news from Newfoundland. A man waiting at the ferry to the Change Islands said that the cod are back and that there are as many fish now as there were when Cabot came. He did not look old enough to know, but I took him at his word. He said that prior to the cod moratorium he could put down his nets and be lucky take ten fish in a day; now, during the season, he can put his nets in the water and take 1,000 lbs of fish in two hours. I may have eaten some of his catch. There was a stretch of one week on the island during which I ate cod eight times in seven days, including my favourite breakfast, which is a cod cake, a slice of bacon, a slice of raw tomato, a pair of poached eggs, and toast with partridgeberry jam. The bad news is that the cod are not back everywhere; not in the north of the island in any number, and not on the west coast. The reason for this is because the big foreign boats continue to fish in the spawning grounds, which are not protected by the 200-mile limit. Why this is allowed, I do not know. There is more bad news. A tanker sank off the west coast of Newfoundland in 1985; it contained some 500 tonnes of fuel oil and diesel, and has recently been leaking; there are oil slicks in the water, globs of it on shore, there are seabirds covered in goo, and if the ship breaks apart it will be a disaster. What’s being done? Monitoring; not much, but some. And this is your federal government at work. In other news, we went up the Northern Peninsula and we stood where Leif Erikson stood, at L’Anse aux Meadows; as you know, this is the site of the first European settlement in North America. It had not occurred to us until that moment but, according to our genial guide, this is the place where we humans finally circled the globe. How so? The eastern wave of humanity came out of Africa, passed through Asia and crossed over the Alaskan land bridge into North America. The western wave of humanity came out of Africa, ended up in Northern Europe, where they built ships and headed from Norway to Greenland and on to Vinland. East met west here. Blew my mind. These are the virtues of guided tours. Less fun is that such revelations tend to come in the company of older people armed with ski poles who are wearing sandals, shorts and stupid hats. Oh, my dear older people, let me remind you that there is a point to wearing clothing that covers up your knobbly bits; keep your bunions, your corns, your calluses and your varicose veins to yourself, please. In other island news, I draw your attention to a problem with the drinking water in the aptly named town of Aquaforte, on what is known as the Irish Loop. The people there are upset because they cannot trust the local water supply, and so are forced to buy the bottled stuff. The St. John’s Telegram sent a reporter. She interviewed a senior citizen, Tom Wall. Her story was on the front page; there, above the fold, was a picture of old Tom holding a glass of suspect water in his kitchen. The headline: “It’s A Goddamn Issue, Maid.” “Maid” is beautifully archaic; we don’t talk like that around here, more’s the pity, and the blasphemy blossoms and gives meaning, emphatic and understated at once, to the word “issue.” You would never get that headline in this paper. In other journalism-related news, tourism is down in Newfoundland as a result of the miserable weather this summer; in a report on CBC Radio, the owner of a restaurant in Norris Point said that people were not likely to drive an hour and a half “when it’s pissing rain” in order to have a fine meal. I doubt that clip would pass muster on the radio in Toronto, where we are too polite, and we do not speak so colourfully. Dammit.

Liberals could win big in Atlantic Canada,NL,"Bill Casey may be the most important candidate running for federal office in Atlantic Canada. The former Conservative-turned-Liberal has received an inordinate amount of attention from the media and from national leaders campaigning on the East Coast. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau paid an early visit to the northern Nova Scotia riding of Cumberland-Colchester, where the 70-year-old was a Tory MP for 15 years, and last week former prime minister Jean Chrétien dropped by to praise his one-time adversary. Casey's former boss, Stephen Harper, has been to the riding twice this year and it was one of his first stops after calling the election. Why the intense interest in a mostly rural riding that few Canadian could find on a map? With the Liberals poised to gain as many as a dozen seats in Atlantic Canada, Trudeau and Chrétien hope Casey will oust the Conservative incumbent, Scott Armstrong. The prime minister's interest, however, is as much personal as political. Harper has a score to settle with Casey, who defied him in 2007 and voted against a budget that reduced provincial revenues from offshore petroleum development. Casey was drummed out of the party but got even in 2008, winning as an independent before joining the Liberal fold. There's another reason for Harper's fixation on Cumberland-Colchester – Tory prospects are so grim in Atlantic Canada that holding the riding would be a symbolic victory and one of the few bright spots in what's shaping up to be an East Coast rout. Last week the region's leading polling firm, Corporate Research Associates, pegged the Conservatives as a distant third in the four Atlantic provinces, with the support of just 18 per cent of respondents. Harper is the least popular of the leaders of the three major parties, the choice of just 16 per cent of respondents. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May is not far behind. Trudeau is the front-runner – one out of three of the poll's respondents want him to be prime minister and 45 per cent plan to vote Liberal or are leaning that way. Thomas Mulcair and the NDP have cut into the Liberal lead in recent months, but remain well back as the choice of one-third of respondents. Harper went into the campaign with 13 of the region's 32 seats. The poll aggregating website threehundredeight.com projects he may emerge on Oct. 20 with a few as three, all of them in New Brunswick. Trudeau's Liberals, meanwhile, began the campaign with a dozen seats and could win 22, according to the site's analysis. The NDP should take the remaining seven – a gain of a single seat. Why is there so much daylight between the parties in the region when national polls consistently point to a tight three-way race? Atlantic Canada has become a regional power base for the Liberals, with three provinces electing or returning the party to government within the past two years. The fourth, Newfoundland and Labrador, appears certain to turf its unpopular Progressive Conservative administration in favour of the Liberals when a provincial vote is held in November. Trudeau's promises to spend on infrastructure and undo the Harper government's changes to the employment insurance program – an underpinning of Atlantic Canada's fishing, tourism and other seasonal industries – have played well in the region. His lukewarm support for the Energy East project (the proposed pipeline to bring Alberta oil and badly needed jobs to New Brunswick) may be the only thing keeping a few of that province's ridings in the Harper camp. The retirements of several incumbents, including regional power broker Peter MacKay, have been a further blow to the Tories. But the malaise goes deeper – Atlantic Canadians have never warmed to Harper and his rebranded Conservative party. All four provincial parties have retained the Progressive Conservative label to keep their distance, and Newfoundland and Labrador's former PC premier Danny Williams openly campaigned against Harper in 2011. This time around, “virtually every Conservative riding is in play,"" notes Corporate Research Associates pollster Don Mills, including MacKay's former riding of Central Nova, which has been in Tory hands for all but four of the past 48 years. And in the neighbouring riding of Cumberland-Colchester, a poll released this week gave Bill Casey a comfortable lead over his Conservative rival. It looks like he'll have the last laugh.

Press Release: British Columbia and Ontario poised to drive Canada's economy next year: CIBC,NL,"British Columbia and Ontario poised to drive Canada's economy next year: CIBC Canada NewsWire TORONTO, Nov. 23, 2015 Changing of the provincial guard in Canadian growth is well underway TORONTO, Nov. 23, 2015 /CNW/ - A changing of the guard in Canadian growth is well underway, with British Columbia and Ontario poised to be the biggest drivers in a still-sluggish Canadian economy next year, finds a new report from CIBC Capital Markets. The report calls for British Columbia's economy to grow by 2.8 per cent in 2016, the strongest of the provinces and just ahead of Ontario at 2.4 per cent real GDP growth. Previously at the top of the heap, Alberta will struggle to recover, with expected growth of only 0.7 per cent next year after a 2015 expected contraction of 1.2 per cent. ""Canada's economic path has been sent off course by weakness in global growth, but to an even greater extent than in the national outlook, provincial fortunes have been turned on their head,"" says Avery Shenfeld, Chief Economist, CIBC Capital Markets, who co-authored the report, Provincial Outlook: The Changing of the Guard, with economists Nick Exarhos and Andrew Grantham. ""Solid growth is in store for the central Canadian and more manufacturing intensive economies of Ontario and Quebec. But, the top spot is reserved for B.C., which has been benefiting the most from overseas investment and from bordering some of the fastest growing areas of the U.S. economy at present."" Before oil prices collapsed, from 2006 to 2014, there was a cumulative 10 per cent gap in real GDP between the three energy provinces -- Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland & Labrador -- and the rest of Canada. That gap has been diminishing, and over the next two years, it will narrow further, the report says. ""The changing of the guard in Canadian growth is well underway,"" says Mr. Shenfeld. Overall, the Canadian economy is forecast to rebound to 1.9 per cent real growth in 2016 and 2.1 per cent in 2017 from a projected 1.1 per cent this year. ""Much of the downshift in national GDP has captured the steep retreat in capital spending in mining, oil and gas over the past year, and 2016 could see a less-dramatic but still negative trend in that sector,"" says Mr. Shenfeld. Negative multiplier effects from energy-centered layoffs will persist into 2016 in such areas as retailing and commercial real estate development, but with energy activity starting from a lower level already, while it will still weigh on Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland & Labrador, it will do less damage to the national GDP growth rate, the report says. Offsetting some of the weakness in the oil patch will be the economic lift from a weaker Canadian dollar and the first leg of increased federal infrastructure spending. While federal infrastructure dollars have yet to be allocated, Ontario, B.C. and Nova Scotia can all make a case that they have the most ground to make up in infrastructure spending, the report says. Defense expenditures will also help Nova Scotia outperform other provinces in Atlantic Canada as shipbuilding activity ramps up. Provincial infrastructure spending in Alberta should help tip its economy into positive territory next year. ""But down the road, the province hopes that a return to energy sector activity arrives in time to counter future fiscal restraint,"" Mr. Shenfeld says. The now-weaker Canadian dollar should buttress manufacturing output, with Ontario and Quebec being the greatest beneficiaries, not only in export volumes today but over time, with new or expanded plants. Less discussed is the soft loonie's stimulative impact on tourism, the report says. ""There, B.C. and P.E.I. stand as the provinces with largest share of GDP in that potentially winning sector and other provinces could benefit to a lesser extent from decreased cross-border shopping,"" says Mr. Shenfeld. The changing of the provincial guard in growth leadership will still leave one key trend in place, however. The less-energy-centered provinces in Atlantic Canada aren't going to completely shed their status as slower trending regions, the report says. ""Demographics are destiny over the medium term, and declining working-age populations in Atlantic Canada underlie their soft potential and actual growth rates since 2006,"" says Mr. Shenfeld. ""In that region, as little as 1 per cent GDP growth can represent a good year in terms of its impact on the unemployment rate.""

Oil slowdown hits Newfoundland businesses,NL,"It wasn't until a few months ago, as the oil industry's troubles deepened, that St. John's retail shop owner Paul Thomey started to see a drop in business. The president and co-owner of That Pro Look, a sports apparel store at the Avalon Mall in Newfoundland and Labrador's largest city, says customers are now reaching more for lower-priced items such as T-shirts instead of jerseys. “You can tell that it's the oilindustry dollars, the people doing three weeks on and off,"" Mr. Thomey said. “Now they've been laid off. We're seeing the impact at the retail level. Anybody that is selling discretionary items is probably feeling it a little bit."" It's not just the oil industry that has hit the Newfoundland economy, but the ongoing slump in the mining sector. Housing starts in St. John's are down 21 per cent from January to November, compared with last year, which is also putting a damper on the local construction sector. “They're struggling,"" Douglas Porter, chief economist with Bank of Montreal, said of the Newfoundland economy. He's forecasting the province's gross domestic product (GDP) to fall 1.7 per cent in 2015, which is bigger than Alberta's expected drop of 1.5 per cent and much worse than the predicted 2-percent growth across the country. BMO is forecasting Newfoundland's GDP to drop 1.5 per cent next year, before bouncing back by 2.5 per cent in 2017. BMO is also forecasting an average unemployment rate of 13.5 per cent for Newfoundland in 2016, a spike from the forecast of 12.6 per cent for 2015. That's also higher than the 11 per cent unemployment rate in the third quarter of 2013, when the Newfoundland economy was booming as oil prices sat steady above $100 (U.S.) a barrel, compared with around $35 today. The province has the highest unemployment rate in the country, Mr. Porter noted. While it has diversified over the years, Newfoundland remains reliant on resources, particularly oil, for economic growth. Kim Keating, chair of the St. John's Board of Trade, said many businesses in the province are accustomed to economic swings, starting with the rise and fall of the fishery in past decades, and now with oil. “They're not sticking their heads in the sand, but at the same time, they're optimistic the oil industry will continue to play a significant role in the province for quite some time,"" Ms. Keating said. She added that many businesses are diversifying, including finding clients and customers outside of the province. An example is Newfoundland Chocolate Co., which has been expanding both in the province as well as in Nova Scotia and has plans to bring its premium artisan chocolates to the Ontario market in 2017. Brent Smith, the company's cofounder and “chief chocolate officer,"" says the business strategy hasn't changed much since the oil industry downturn, although they are putting more emphasis on outside expansion. He believes the “glory days of oil"" will return. “Meantime, we're not holding our breath and sitting still."" The company has been adding business lines, including a chocolate café on Signal Hill, a tourist destination in St. John's, as well as a store in the city's downtown core. The chocolate company is also seeing slower corporate sales. “They're still ordering, but their orders are a bit smaller than they've been before. They've scaled back,"" Mr. Smith says. “I don't think anyone is hitting any panic buttons,"" Mr. Smith says of his and other small businesses in the province. “We've been through a lot worse than this."""
"Where to go in 2016, from Canada to Costa Rica: The top 16 destinations to visit next year",NL,"With a world of travel opportunities to discover, The Independent’s travel teamhas distilled the best experiences on offer in 2016 CUBA A week before Christmas, Washington and Havana reached an agreement to open up scheduled flights between the US and Cuba. By the end of next year, there could be 110 flights a day from Florida and other parts of the US to Havana and Cuba's leading provincial cities. From a global perspective the addition of around six million extra aircraft seats a year across the Straits of Florida is welcome news – no longer will 300 million Americans be barred by their own government from visiting the nearest, most interesting and most beautiful Caribbean island. But from the perspective of British travellers, the effect will be to push up prices and squeeze capacity still further. If only half those six million extra seats are filled by vacationing Americans, tourism to Cuba will rise by half. The private sector, in the shape of casas particulares (private B&Bs;) and paladares (family-run restaurants), can accommodate some of the surge. But the strains are beginning to show. Via Azul buses, which have long offered fairly smooth and reliable transport, are now often sold out. In hotspots such as Old Havana and the Unesco World Heritage town of Trinidad, prices are rising and, in some cases, standards are slipping. One solution for visitors is to focus on parts of the island where tourists rarely go: the beaches and fishing villages on the north coast of Pinar del Rio in the far west, or the stretch of shore between Moa and Baracoa in the far east. Another is to sign up for a tour with a travel firm that has been selling Cuba for decades – and has the necessary contacts to make sure things run smoothly. Journey Latin America (journeylatinamerica.co.uk[http://journeylatinamerica.co.uk]) has a 15-day Parakeet: Cuba Beyond the Beach tour that includes flights, transport and family stays for £2,095pp. Tourist officials in every other Caribbean island are looking with dismay at the warming Cuba-US relations, and British travellers can expect some enticing offers as the dominant American market starts to dry up. Simon Calder CANADA You wait for years for another budget airline between the UK and the world's second-largest country, and two come along at once. While Air Transat continues to offer excellent value from British airports to various Canadian cities, the price points are being set by WestJet – the no-frills carrier that celebrates its 20th birthday in February 2016. The airline (westjet.com[http://westjet.com]) was founded by a British entrepreneur, Clive Beddoe. After dipping a toe in the North Atlantic last summer with a daily Glasgow-Halifax route, WestJet is launching four flights a day from Gatwick to a total of six Canadian cities. Three are the usual suspects: Toronto, Vancouver and WestJet's base, Calgary. But the remainder comprise St John's in Newfoundland, which previously was expensive to reach, and two cities that had fallen off the route map: Edmonton and Winnipeg. And who's this appearing on the radar? Our old friend Icelandair, which is taking advantage of low oil prices to expand its low-cost flights. Aberdeen is a new UK departure, and Montreal a new Canadian destination for the summer (icelandair.co.uk[http://icelandair.co.uk]). SC SAN SEBASTIAN The closest big Spanish city to the UK, San Sebastián has an odd feature: it lacks an international airport. Perhaps that splendid semi-isolation is what has helped to keep the city magical. The two great attractions are the luscious, shell-shaped La Concha beach and an Old Town infused with amazing places to eat and drink. Yet Donostia (the city's official, Basque name) is simply not visited as much as it would be if it were easier to reach. That may start to change this year, though, when San Sebastián gets its year in the sun as joint European Capital of Culture – known locally, if clumsily, as DSS2016EU (dss2016.eu[http://dss2016.eu]). The party starts on San Sebastián Day, 20 January, when the Capital of Culture year officially begins with a four-day programme of activities – culminating on 23 January with a spectacular visual show.

SC BRAZIL Many travellers have a simple policy about Olympic host cities: avoid them like dengue fever in the three years building up to the Games, because the location will be doing just that: building up, with all the disruption that the biggest sporting event on the planet inevitably entails. And as for the event itself? Well, everyone knows that air fares and hotel prices triple before, during and after the Games as the fans flood in. So, Rio 2016 is off-limits, right? As the last Olympics in London demonstrated, it doesn't actually work like that. Sure, there are contingents of sports fans who will be paying the £2,175 currently being asked by British Airways (ba.com) for a return flight to Rio to tie in the with Games. Certainly many hotels are either showing ""full"" or charging outlandish rates. But if you take a relaxed attitude, there will be bargains to be had between 5-21 August, when the Games take place. And even if you don't know one end of a pole-vault pole from the other, it could be the time to explore other parts of Brazil, such as the wildlife-rich Pantanal. July and August are ideal months to visit, and the distortions caused by Rio 2016 mean that demand is likely to be diminished.

Costing from A$425 (£200), it includes pontoon accommodation, meals and snorkelling before daytrippers arrive. Aquatic adventures continue across the continent in Western Australia, where humpback whale swimming tours will be introduced on Ningaloo Reef, home to the largest population of the cetaceans in the world, from June. A select number of operators has been granted licences to operate the ecologically sensitive tours, including Exmouth-based Charter 1 (charter1.com.au[http://charter1.com.au]) from A$385pp (£185). Back on land in South Australia, the Kangaroo Island Wilderness Trail is an ongoing project to create one of Australia's greatest multi-day walks in Flinders Chase National Park, taking in such famed formations as Remarkable Rocks and Admirals Arch. The 63km, five-day trail is expected to launch in September (bit.ly/KangarooSkip[http://bit.ly/KangarooSkip]). From April, Field of Light will illuminate another Australian icon – Uluru. The artist Bruce Munro will install more than 50,000 solar-powered lights across the landscape of the Red Centre that will glow as the sun sets each evening for a year (brucemunro.co.uk[http://brucemunro.co.uk]).

So, what's in store for those thinking about a visit in 2016? On screen, The Jungle Book has been updated by Disney as a 3D live animation with voices from Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley and Scarlett Johansson, due for release in April. Rudyard Kipling's novel was set in the wildlife-rich forests of Madhya Pradesh where Wild Frontiers (wild frontierstravel.com) is offering a 12-day Jungle Book group tour, visiting three national parks on the look-out for real-life Shere Khans, Baloos and more. It costs from £2,795pp excluding flights. Released later in the year, Gurinder Chadha's Viceroy's House was filmed at Umaid Bhawan Palace (tajhotels.com; doubles from R21,150/£210 B&B;) on the outskirts of Jodhpur in Rajasthan. It stars Gillian Anderson and Hugh Bonneville and focuses on Lord Mountbatten's last six months as Viceroy, as India prepared for independence. More Brits inextricably linked to India include the Beatles, who spent time in Rishikesh in 1968, meditating and making music at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh. After going into decline, the ashram was reclaimed by the forest. The Uttar Pradesh Forest Department has just reopened it, allowing visitors inside meditation cells once used by George and John (uttarakhandtourism.gov.in[http://uttarakhandtourism.gov.in]). Uttar Pradesh is making a bid to tempt tourists away from neighbouring Rajasthan with its own heritage trail that takes in Agra, not just home to the Taj Mahal but also the colossal Red Fort and, on the outskirts, the Mughal palace complex of Fatehpur Sikri; Lucknow, where the Raj began and ended; and Chambal National Park, home to Ganges dolphins, gharial crocodiles and a soon-to-be-reintroduced population of lions. Landmarks also include the temples at Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon, Kushinigar where he died, and the ancient holy Hindu city of Varanasi. Greaves India (greavesindia.com[http://greavesindia.com]) can tailor-make tours of the state. SL COSTA RICA Pura Vida is this Central American nation's unofficial slogan, which manifests itself in many ways, not least the vitality of its national parks and nature reserves (visitcostarica.com[http://visitcostarica.com]). Come up close to a live volcano in Arenal National Park, explore Caribbean coral reefs in Cahuita, trek through tropical rainforest in Corcovado, spot sloths and monkeys in Manuel Antonio or look for green sea turtles in Tortuguero National Park. Sandwiched between the surf-washed Pacific and gentle Caribbean coasts you'll find endless opportunities for wildlife encounters up-close and nature-enveloped hikes. British Airways (ba.com) is resurrecting flights from Gatwick to the central capital, San José, from 4 May. In addition, Thomson (thomson.co.uk/flights[http://thomson.co.uk/flights]) recently resumed its link between Gatwick and Liberia in the north-west, offering easy access to the national parks of Guanacaste province and its Pacific beaches. The flights are the only direct links between the UK and Central America, meaning that trips to neighbouring countries will also be more easily achieved. For example Tucan Travel (tucantravel.com[http://tucantravel.com]) is offering a nine-day San José to Panama City trip using the new BA link. A price of £1,519pp includes visits to Manuel Antonio National Park, Monteverde Cloud Forest, Arenal Volcano and San José before heading south across the border to Panama's Caribbean Bocas del Toro archipelago, the coffee plantations of Boquete, and ending in buzzing Panama City. SL PERU Another Latin American destination that's about to receive a non-stop link with London is Lima, Peru's cosmpolitan capital. British Airways starts flights from Gatwick on 4 May, in time for visitors to witness Inti Raymi, the festival of the sun that salutes the Incan god Inti on the Winter Solstice, 24 June. The celebrations take place at the ruins of Sacsayhuamán in Cusco, with processions, music, dancing and a mock sacrifice (peru.travel). Real World Holidays (realworldholidays.co.uk[http://realworldholidays.co.uk]) is offering a short five-day trip that takes in the festivities, departing Gatwick on 22 June and including VIP tickets to the event, accommodation, transfers, entrance fees and flights, all for £1,795pp. Explora (explora.com[http://explora.com]), the Chile-based luxury adventure lodge group is opening a hacienda on an ancient corn plantation in the Sacred Valley in the second half of 2016. It will offer a luxurious base for treks in the valley and up to Machu Picchu. Even older than Machu Picchu is the pre-Incan ruined fortress of Kuelap, which was developed in the sixth and seventh centuries by the Chachapoyas. The largest stone structure on the continent, it contains around 450 houses in the Utcubamba Valley in northern Peru. Previously accessed by trekking, it will be connected by a new 4km cable car from Tingo Nuevo early next year (kuelapperu.com[http://kuelapperu.com]). SL IRELAND 2016 marks the centenary of the Easter Rising, the armed rebellion that fomented fundamental change in Ireland's political landscape, eventually bringing an end to British rule, and thereby establishing the Republic of Ireland. The commemorative programme of events includes a parade on Easter Sunday from Dublin Castle to Parnell Square, concerts at the National Concert Hall during Easter Week and Ravelóid, a festival from 10-12 June that celebrates Irish language and culture at Ardgillan Castle in North County Dublin (raveloid.ie[http://raveloid.ie]; €99). Meanwhile, Northern Ireland is drawing attention to its culinary credentials with a Year of Food and Drink (tourismni.com[http://tourismni.com]). As well as food festivals and special events, there will be a Breakfast Month in January celebrating the Ulster Fry, a Love Local month in February drawing attention to home-grown brands, a Brewing and Distilling month in April and plenty more. Belmond (belmond.com/grandhibernian[http://belmond.com/grandhibernian]), the train operator of the Venice Simplon-Orient- Express, is launching the Belmond Grand Hibernian in August. The luxury train will transport up to 40 guests in five-star style across Ireland. Itineraries include the two-night Realm of Giants in Northern Ireland, a four-night Legends and Loughs in Cork, Killarney, Connemara National Park and Galway, and a six-night Grand Tour of Ireland that also includes a tour of Dublin. Prices from €3,160pp with all meals, drinks and excursions. For a different perspective on the Irish landscape, book into a bubble in Co Fermanagh. The Forest Domes are new to the Finn Lough Resort.

SL St Helena ST HELENA Out in the Atlantic, more than 1,200 miles from the nearest landmass (Angola), St Helena is one of the world's most remote islands, currently only accessible by sea. Most hop aboard the Royal Mail Ship St Helena for the five-day trip from Cape Town to this British Overseas Territory. That is to change in 2016, when a much-anticipated airport opens. The big day is 21 May, St Helena Day, though a start date for the first flights hasn't yet been announced. Once South Africa-based Comair (a British Airways code-share partner; comair.co.za[http://comair.co.za]) launches its weekly service from Johannesburg, reaching the island will become (relatively) straightforward, if a little less romantic. The last ship sails in July. So what is there to see on this tiny (10x5 miles) island once you arrive? Plenty of history, for one thing: Napoleon was exiled here from 1815 until his death in 1821, and his residence, Longwood House, is now a museum. There are also dramatic volcanic and coastal landscapes, wildlife (the island is a twitcher's paradise) and the colourful little capital, Jamestown. Jamestown will be the location of a new hotel, due to open in late 2016, presumably to cater to an influx of new visitors. Part of the Mantis collection (mantiscollection.com[http://mantiscollection.com]), the four-star property will occupy three Georgian buildings. Nicola Trup TAIPEI The stylish and vibrant capital of Taiwan will affirm its cool credentials next year when it takes up the mantle of World Design Capital (wdc2016.taipei[http://wdc2016.taipei]), hosting a series of design-focused events around the theme ""Adaptive City – Design in Motion"". These include the International Design House exhibition, as well as less formal pop-up celebrations. The city will also welcome several new hotels from design-focused chains, such as the Aloft (starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels[http://starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels]) and CitizenM (citizenm.com[http://citizenm.com]), opening in late 2016 in Beitou and Ximending respectively. The local boutique brand, Amba (amba-hotels.com[http://amba-hotels.com]), will launch its third location in spring, in the Songshan area. Getting into Taipei from the main international airport, Taoyuan, becomes easier, when the MRT (metro) links the two for the first time. Until now, the airport has only been served by coaches or buses, but the eagerly awaited (and much delayed) new line is due to open in ""early 2016"". For those more into travelling on two wheels, Taipei is surprisingly bike-friendly, with dedicated paths and a cycle share scheme. And on 6 March, visitors can watch the first stage of the annual Tour de Taiwan (tourdetaiwan.org.tw[http://tourdetaiwan.org.tw]) in Taipei, before it moves on to the coast. NT WROCLAW You might not know how to pronounce the name of this picturesque Polish city (roughly, ""Vrots-wav"") but you soon will, as it's firmly on the radar for 2016. As European Capital of Culture (held jointly with San Sebastián), it has a packed calendar of more than 1,000 cultural events across film, music, art, architecture and performance. The opening weekend takes place 15-17 January, culminating in ""The Awakening"", the city's biggest ever parade, incorporating light installations, effigies and even trams. Other highlights of the year's programme include the Theatre Olympiad and the European Film Awards, plus literary celebrations organised as part of Wroclaw's tenure as Unesco World Book Capital City (en.unesco.org/world-book-capital-city[http://en.unesco.org/world-book-capital-city]). This may be a traditional-looking town – its colourful main square is like a miniature Krakow – but next year's new hotel opening is a little more modern. Launching in summer, the DoubleTree by Hilton Wroclaw (bit.ly/DoubleWroclaw[http://bit.ly/DoubleWroclaw]) is set within Ovo, a curvaceous new development of shops, apartments and restaurants. And getting to the city becomes easier from the Midlands on 18 March, when Wizz Air (wizzair.com[http://wizzair.com]) begins flying direct from Birmingham twice a week. NT BARBADOS In 2016, Barbados will mark 50 years of independence from British rule, and a series of special events will take place, not least on 30 November, Independence Day, when celebrations will include a parade and the illumination of key buildings around the capital, Bridgetown. Held throughout November, the National Independence Festival of Creative Arts (ncf.bb[http://ncf.bb]) celebrates drama, dance, music, literature, fine art and more. Other events include the 80th Round Barbados Race sailing series (mountgayrumroundbarbadosrace.com[http://mountgayrumroundbarbadosrace.com]), which celebrates its 80th edition from 16-24 January; and the Barbados 50, a transatlantic yacht rally to commemorate the independence anniversary. It will set sail from London in July and arrive in Bridgetown in late November. For non-sailors, Barbados Open Water Festival takes place 2-6 November, with a number of organised swims, kayak and stand-up paddleboard races, and an all-day beach party. And where to stay while you're there? Wyndham and Hyatt both have new hotels in the pipeline for 2017 and beyond, but next year several existing properties become bigger and better. In spring, Sandy Beach will relaunch as the all-inclusive, refurbished The Sands, and Sandals Barbados is also expanding. NT Great outdoors: have an adventure in Snowdonia (Wales Crown copyright/Welsh Assembly Government) WALES The principality has enjoyed a surge of adventurous openings in 2015, including Surf Snowdonia (surfsnowdonia.co.uk[http://surfsnowdonia.co.uk]), an artificial surf lagoon, and Go Below Xtreme (go-below.co.uk[http://go-below.co.uk]), an underground zip-line. With so much adrenalin pumping, Wales has named 2016 its Year of Adventure, with ambassadors including Bear Grylls encouraging visitors to make the most of its outdoor (and underground) activities, from surfing to survival skills, with special events to be announced in the coming months (visitwales.com[http://visitwales.com]). Even relaxation calls for a degree of adventure in Wales, not least at Seacotherapy (seacotherapy.co.uk[http://seacotherapy.co.uk]), a new coastal wellbeing retreat, opening in Aberdyfi in May. It will combine beached-based activities (yoga, stand-up paddle boarding, rock pooling and more) with mindfulness practices. Next year will also see the release of Guy Ritchie's Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur, which was shot in various Welsh locations including Snowdonia. Visitors can walk in the footsteps of King Arthur (bit.ly/ArthurWalk[http://bit.ly/ArthurWalk]) and find a stone allegedly bearing the hoof print of his horse Llamrai on the banks of Lake Barfog near Betws y Coed. 2016 also marks 100 years since Roald Dahl was born in Cardiff. A programme of activities is planned for the ""City of the Unexpected"" event, which will take place across Cardiff on 17-18 September (bit.ly/Dahl100[http://bit.ly/Dahl100]). Chloë Hamilton ENGLAND You can hardly move for literary anniversaries in England next year. Anyone would think we'd been saving them up. The 200th anniversary of Charlotte Brontë's birth is on 21 April. In celebration, a number of exhibits will pop up across the UK, including at the Brontë Parsonage Museum (bronte.org.uk[http://bronte.org.uk]), which was the family home. Author Tracy Chevalier will curate an exhibition titled ""I Shall Go Off Like a Bombshell: Charlotte Great and Small"". Another exhibition, ""Celebrating Charlotte"", will appear at the National Portrait Gallery (npg.org .uk[http://npg.org .uk]), before moving to New York. William Shakespeare will also be commemorated in 2016, 400 years after the Bard's death, thought to be around 23 April. Shakespeare's Schoolroom (shakespeares-england.co.uk[http://shakespeares-england.co.uk]), where the playwright was educated, will open for the first time in April, while the Royal Shakespeare Company (rsc.org.uk[http://rsc.org.uk]) will launch a new immersive theatre experience. Finally, hop to the Lake District to celebrate the creator of Peter Rabbit and friends. Beatrix Potter was born 150 years ago in London on 28 July, but spent most of her life in the North-west (golakes.co.uk/beatrixpotter[http://golakes.co.uk/beatrixpotter]). The children's author will be remembered with events at various National Trust venues, including a children's literary festival at Wray Castle, where the writer stayed in the Lake District as a teenager (national trust.org.uk/wray-castle). Near St Albans, Willows Activity Farm (willowsactivityfarm.com[http://willowsactivityfarm.com]) will launch a new Peter Rabbit Adventure Playground on 2 April.

ATB Financial predicts first half of 2016 roughest yet in Alberta downturn,NL,"EDMONTON _ Alberta's Crown-owned bank is predicting the first six months of this year will be the roughest yet in the current economic downturn. ATB Financial is forecasting the petroleum industry will continue to shed jobs due to the unrelenting drop in the price of oil, with Fort McMurray and Calgary taking the hardest hit. ""We do see the first half of 2016 probably being the toughest months of this recession for Albertans,'' ATB chief economist Todd Hirsch said Thursday. ""We will see more contractions in the economy, we will see more layoffs and that will add to a heightened unemployment rate.'' Hirsch said the provincial unemployment rate could climb to eight per cent from seven per cent by the middle of the year. Alberta's unemployment rate in January 2015 was 4.7 per cent. The ATB report forecasts weaker consumer demand for housing and retail products. It also says it is possible that more people will leave Alberta than move to the province. Hirsch said the economy is expected to start turning around by the end of the year. ""By the end of 2016 we do see some of these heavy clouds of pessimism start to lift off the province, but the first half of the year will be tough for a lot of people.'' The ATB report comes a day after Alberta's NDP government announced a freeze on the salaries 7,000 public sector managers for two years in the face of dropping oil and natural gas revenues. The salary freeze is expected to save the province $57 million. Opposition critics have called the measure a drop in the bucket when Alberta is forecasting this year's budget deficit to be $6.1 billion. Hirsch declined to answer questions about the government's handling of the economy. He said any jurisdiction that depends on petroleum revenues right now is suffering, including Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador. Despite the gloomy forecast there are some pockets of optimism in ATB's economic outlook. The report says other sectors of Alberta's economy, such as agriculture, forestry and tourism, are doing well, due in part to the weak Canadian dollar. But Hirsch said even when measured together, their effect on the economy will not offset the steep drop in the price of oil. ""It is important to remind ourselves that there is more to Alberta's economy than petroleum, but we do have to bear in mind that the petroleum sector is the dog that wags an awful lot of tails in this province.''"

Old Harry oil exploration licence in Gulf of St. Lawrence extended,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ Environmental activists who want a drilling moratorium in the Gulf of St. Lawrence weren't impressed Friday as regulators extended an oil exploration licence for the Old Harry site by another year. Corridor Resources Inc. (TSX-CDH) of Halifax had until Friday to offer a $1 million deposit to extend the licence until next January. The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board announced the province and Ottawa agreed to waive the fee. Federal and provincial Natural Resources ministers ratified the move ""in consideration of regulatory factors that have resulted in ... delays in drilling a validation well in the final year of (Corridor's) nine-year licence term,'' the board said in a news release. Spokesman Sean Kelly said no one was available for further comment. Corridor Resources President and CEO Steve Moran referred all questions to the offshore petroleum board. ""It's awful,'' said Sylvain Archambault of the St. Lawrence Coalition, one of several environmental and indigenous groups across Canada that have called for a drilling moratorium in the Gulf. ""This is the third time they've obtained such a free pass.'' In its news release, the offshore board said it will soon announce plans for consultations with aboriginal groups and the public on related environmental assessments. Such regulatory requirements must be complete before any drilling goes ahead, Kelly confirmed in an email. The federal government has estimated the Gulf and surrounding areas potentially hold 39 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.5 billion barrels of oil. Indigenous groups and environmental activists have urged a moratorium in the Gulf pending a scientific review of risks. They also want to see collective management strategies involving the five adjacent provinces _ Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI and Newfoundland and Labrador. ""Drilling would be close to the shore of any province,'' Archambault said Friday in an interview. The Old Harry site is about 80 kilometres west of Newfoundland. One theory is that it was named for a community on the nearby Magdalen Islands. ""Scientific spill scenarios clearly show that the west coast of Newfoundland would be impacted as well as Cape Breton and the Magdalen Islands,'' Archambault said. ""In the Gulf there are fisheries worth over $1.5 billion. There's tourism, communities living all around the Gulf. We really don't want the same scenario that happened in the Gulf of Mexico to repeat itself here.'' The Deepwater Horizon explosion April 20, 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 rig workers. An estimated 3.19 million barrels of oil spewed into the water before engineers could cap the blown-out well 87 days later. ""And the Old Harry drilling site would be smack in the middle of the Laurentian Channel which is the highway used by all the migrating species _ whales, salmon, cod,'' Archambault said. ""Anything happening there would be disastrous.''"
Not the road to prosperity,NL,"The $8.9 billion budget introduced Tuesday by New Brunswick's Liberal government is a classic example of a government adopting the same old remedies, while hoping for a different result. It offers a lesson to all Canadian governments that hope a return to the days of high taxes and fervent spending can solve the very problems brought on by those practices. Before getting to the bad news, the budget indulged in much of the same soothing verbiage beloved of finance ministers with nothing concrete to report. The plan, unveiled by Finance Minister Roger Melanson, ""lays (the) foundation for investments in priorities"" and takes ""a balanced approach"" to taxes and expenditures. In reality, Melanson raised the HST to 15 per cent from 13 per cent, increased corporate taxes and will add $347 million to the debt, which is expected to reach $13.4 billion by March 2017 - nearly $18,000 per person. Some 1,000 civil service positions will be lost. ""New Brunswickers have been clear that they will not accept deep cuts,"" said Melanson, but presented no realistic plan for building the economic dynamism that alone can prevent such cuts. A recent Fraser Institute study warned that interest payments on federal and provincial government debt total $60.8 billion, consuming 8.1 per cent of government revenue, exceeding the annual payments of the Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan combined by nearly $10 billion. Indeed, the ghost of deficits past nationwide now nearly equals total spending on primary and secondary education. New Brunswick's numbers are generally worse than the average. Debt as a share of GDP is 38.3 per cent, higher than every province except profligate Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland, and up by more than half in just 10 years. Net debt per person, up 74 per cent since 2007, is eclipsed only by Manitoba, Ontario and Alberta. And the 8.2 per cent of revenue spent servicing the debt is lower than in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, but worse than every Western province and P.E.I. What, then, is to be done? The budget speech declares that ""it needs to change, and it begins today."" Yet the province will continue to pile up debt and hope against hope that interest rates don't rise. New Brunswick has run a deficit for 10 straight years. It professes to expect a balanced budget by 2020-21, but NDP Leader Dominic Cardy reflected a realistic skepticism when he suggested ""there's absolutely no way anyone can make a projection like that right now with the chaos we're seeing in international markets, with our economy being thrown off by the collapse in the oil and gas sector around the world."" A nod was made to spending restraint: as teachers retire, fewer will be hired to replace them. The civil service will be reorganized to operate with fewer bodies and middle managers reduced by 30 per cent through attrition. A government-owned golf course and a fishing lodge will be privatized and some tourist offices closed. Melanson argued that the HST increase and corporate tax hike, to 14 per cent, were needed to avoid ""deep cuts in education and health care."" But returning the HST to the 2006 level will produce, at best, $300 million in revenue, while further depressing economic growth on which those programs ultimately depend. What the budget's authors fail to recognize is that its current malaise results from just the sort of counterproductive practices it is now expanding. A corporate rate of 14 per cent will hardy entice businesses away from Ontario or Alberta, where the rate is lower. Entrepreneurs are also unlikely to be attracted by one of the country's highest marginal personal tax rates. Highincome earners are so heavily taxed now that the government was forced to cancel its own top rate to allow for the federal Liberals' pledge to increase taxes on the rich. At 53 per cent, it will still be neckand-neck with Nova Scotia as the highest in the country. A quarter of a century ago, Saskatchewan's socialist premier Roy Romanow argued, ""We can't afford any sacred cows or we risk losing the entire herd."" But Romanow protected the herd by balancing budgets and keeping a close eye on spending, even when it irked his own caucus and NDP ideology. Too many of his successors across the country have failed to follow his example, running up debt and dreaming up ever-more ingenious ways to extract revenue from taxpayers. The federal Liberals' plan to borrow and spend to boost the economy further validates bad habits that were already too ingrained. New Brunswick has one of Canada's most challenged economies. It got that way by consistently avoiding tough decisions to deal with hard realities. Other jurisdictions should examine its predicament and learn the lessons."
Fiscal lessons from New Brunswick,NL,"The 2016 budget season kicked off this week in New Brunswick, with a bitter double dose of tax increases and public-sector cuts that's certain to be repeated across the country as other provinces grapple with deficits and bad economic news. Premier Brian Gallant's Liberal government presented an $8.9-billion budget that hiked the harmonized sales tax to 15 per cent from 13 per cent, matching neighbouring Nova Scotia for the highest rate in the country. Tax credits will soften the blow for lower-income consumers – forgoing $100 million in badly needed revenue – and there will be higher taxes on corporations and on cigarettes. Coupled with this revenue boost, some 1,300 civil service management positions will be eliminated over the next five years, saving hundreds of millions of dollars. An array of services will be trimmed or cut, including the suspension of a ferry connection and closure of tourist information centres. Health care and education escaped the axe, at least for now. The upshot: a projected deficit of $347 million, only a modest improvement over last year's shortfall of about $470 million. Balancing the budget and reversing New Brunswick's ballooning debt, which will reach a projected $13.4 billion by March 2017 – almost $18,000 per capita – will have to wait until 2020, well after the next provincial election. In the meantime, the crippling debt load leaves the government with little room to manoeuvre. There's little left over to inject into improving the sluggish provincial economy. The latest figures peg the unemployment rate at just under nine per cent. The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan announced last month it will close a major potash mine, wiping out more than 400 jobs. Construction of the proposed Energy East pipeline, which promises to bring jobs as well as western crude to New Brunswick, is years away, assuming the project is approved. In a state of the province address last week, Gallant reminded New Brunswickers of the sobering and “startling fact' that the province spends “more on interest payments on our debt than we invest in universities, colleges and financial aid for students combined.' Gallant and Finance Minister Roger Melanson inherited this fiscal straitjacket in the fall of 2014, when the Liberals defeated the one-term Progressive Conservative government of David Alward. But the province's financial woes were almost ignored during the election campaign. Both parties recognized the political reality that service cuts and tax hikes are never popular on the campaign trial. The same reality-avoidance descended on last fall's election in Newfoundland and Labrador. New Liberal Premier Dwight Ball was swept into office with no clear plan to deal with the dramatic collapse of offshore oil revenues and a deficit that has swelled to almost $2 billion. There's a lesson here for Manitoba voters as they prepare to pass judgment on their long-serving NDP government. While the province's economy and prospects are far brighter than New Brunswick's or Newfoundland's, the deficit is on the rise and closing in on half a billion dollars this year. No matter which party wins in April, it will have to face fiscal reality. Manitoba's political leaders should make their deficit-fighting plans clear during the upcoming election campaign, not revealed as an afterthought.

St. John's feeling the Big Oil squeeze; Local businesses say since price of oil dropped it's 'like the tap was turned off',NL,"On St. John's touristy Water St., just down from the pubs holding nightly ""screech-ins,"" restaurants that once hosted swanky oil exec dinner meetings have shuttered. Landlords can't find tenants for their executive rental suites, while new home construction has dropped by 20 per cent. Charity events have been cancelled and the food bank faces a downturn in donations from Big Oil. ""A lot of businesses are telling us they don't know if they'll be around next year,"" said Kim Keating, outgoing president of the St. John's Board of Trade, where 72 per cent of members recently surveyed said conditions are worse than a year ago. ""They can directly link between their business and the price of oil because they're not seeing the clientele they did a year ago."" Here's a look at how some local businesses have been affected: The bankruptcy and accounting business Insolvency filings are up 22 per cent over the last year at accounting and insolvency firm Noseworthy Chapman. ""The trend is really people who were working away who have either had their hours cut or a layoff,"" said partner David Howe. ""When you go from the salary that an oil worker is making to EI, there's a huge impact on your cash flow."" There hasn't been a pickup in commercial insolvencies, but clients are feeling the squeeze from oil companies asking for price reductions. The cargo port The number of ships supplying offshore rigs in the St. John's harbour has fallen nearly 20 per cent in the past six months. Cargo ships dock about 45 times a month to pick up supplies and drop off waste for the offshore oil rigs. But just six months ago, the number of ships was more than 50, said Geoff Cunningham, director of offshore operations at St. John's A. Harvey Marine Base. Two of the seven offshore rigs that the base supplied in 2014 have shut down temporarily. The marine base is taking a revenue hit, but so far there have only been a few layoffs, he said. The pub Erin's Pub, a popular spot for traditional music, helped launch bands like Great Big Sea. Now there are nights with just five customers. Bob Hallett, a member of Great Big Sea who bought the pub in 2012, said that just 18 months ago the bar and his restaurant Tavola were full of oil executives and engineers earning six figures and given big expense accounts. Because they didn't have their families in St. John's, they were eating out and going to the pub seven nights a week, he said. ""They were reliable, seven-nights-a-week customers, and then they disappeared."" This winter has been even worse for business than the previous one, with business down as much as 25 to 30 per cent, he said. ""New Year's Eve was like a half-decent Friday."" The restaurants At Raymond's, a gourmet restaurant consistently ranked as one of Canada's top restaurants, oil industry Christmas parties were virtually non-existent this year. ""There's so much tension right now,"" said owner Jeremy Bonia, who believes the worst of the slowdown has yet to sink in. It's not just the high-end restaurants feeling the pinch. Rocket Bakery and Fresh Food has seen a drop-off in lunch catering orders, with fewer bookings of their upstairs meeting spaces from oil companies. ""We really came when money was flowing,"" recalls owner Kelly Mansell, who moved to Newfoundland from Toronto to open the kitschy café and catering company in 2011. ""But in December, it was like the tap was turned off."" The real estate business High-end executive rentals are sitting empty, or being rented for far less than they fetched when St. John's was booming with oil-related business. ""In the executive rental market, the inventory is triple what it was even two years ago,"" said real estate agent and landlord Larry Hann. He's been trying to find a renter for a condo that rented for $4,800 a month in 2014, and is now priced at $3,500. It has been on the market for seven months. The food bank There was a marked decline in cash donations at the Newfoundland food bank's 2015 Christmas drive, with some oil companies cutting their contributions in half. ""A lot of these companies, the employees have been slashed so there's less people to give,"" said Egbert Walters, general manager."
Feasting in Fogtown,NL,"Canada How fog-prone St John's on the tip of Newfoundland became an unlikely gourmet hit. By Nigel Tisdall Should you ever go to St John's, the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador, I must warn you there is nothing to see. Well, there certainly isn't the day I arrive in what locals call ""Fogtown"", close to the easternmost tip of North America. The view from Signal Hill, from where one might normally survey its scenic harbour, is pure cotton wool. This is a shame, but bad weather has never stopped the fun in this most entertaining of ports. Settled by fishermen from England's West Country in the early 17th century, St John's sprawls across the hills, a merry jumble of jelly bean-coloured houses, modern civic eyesores, show-off wooden mansions built by the kings of cod, and haughty churches from the 19th century. So why go? ""People come here to breathe,"" explains Lori McCarthy, a local tour guide, ""and to grab an extra half-hour."" (The island enjoys its own timezone, 30 minutes ahead of the rest of Atlantic Canada.) Whales, icebergs and a rich linguistic and musical culture reminiscent of Ireland are other reasons. And, if you believe the current buzz, a burgeoning food scene to rival any in the country, centred on the area's abundant fish, seafood, game, berries and wild plants. ""In the last five years close to 20 restaurants have opened in St John's,"" says McCarthy, whose company, Cod Sounds, runs food, foraging and fishing tours that help visitors tune in to this culinary flourishing. The boom has been partly spurred by the oil and gas industry, which has brought in new wealth over the past 15 years, but is primarily born out of the hard graft of local entrepreneurs, often self-taught, who have decided to pick up the saucepans in a weather-whipped port that most of the world thinks is unfathomably remote. It isn't. The flying time from London to St John's is a mere five-anda-half hours; from New York or Toronto, about three hours. ""Not so long ago people here didn't know what charcuterie meant,"" says Shaun Hussey, chef and co-owner of Chinched Bistro in Queen Street, the first stop on McCarthy's three-hour ""Taste of St John's"" tour. Every fortnight Hussey takes delivery of an island-raised pig that forms the prime ingredient for his dishes. ""I like to see what happens when you throw salt on stuff,"" he explains. Sampling his house-cured fiocco, coppa, lonza and chorizo asturiana, I see why this small, two-storey restaurant has become such a hit since opening five years ago. Hussey and his partner, Michelle LeBlanc, are typical of the St John's let's-just-do-it spirit. The Newfoundland Chocolate Company in nearby Duckworth Street was set up in a basement in 2008 by a no-previous-experience geographer and neuroscientist couple, Brent and Christina Smith. Later, I meet Jonathan Richler, a radio presenter boldly cooking up Jewish cuisine with a twist of Newfoundland, and Adam Blanchard, who in 2010 gave himself a Christmas present of a cheese press and a how-to-make-it book. Now his company, Five Brothers, is the only artisan cheesemaker in a province larger than Germany. There is a similar energy at Mallard Cottage, a homely restaurant in the Quidi Vidi neighbourhood, framed with window boxes filled with lettuce, herbs and flowers. Opened in 2013 with rustic wooden walls and seal leather seats, it is the sort of snug place where you secretly wish to get snowed in, surviving the blizzards with pan-fried halibut, duck leg confit and a help-yourself cakes table that costs just C$10 (£5) a head. One of my best finds on this gourmet odyssey is a ""rhubourbon"" cocktail created by Mallard Cottage's barman Gregory Brown that acknowledges the Newfoundlanders' deep love of rhubarb. Mixing bourbon, triple sec, sparkling wine and rhubarb balsamic shrub (a house-made syrup), it makes a fine pick-me-up for Sunday brunch (which is served here till 5pm), half hair-of-the-dog, half ""uh-oh-here-we-go-again"" . . . How bad were things before all this? ""Bad!"" says Tony Butt, proprietor of the Reluctant Chef in Duckworth Street, another stop on McCarthy's tour. ""People would boil everything up, then make the stock into gravy, then pour the flavour back on."" After starting out as a volunteer dishwasher in an Italian restaurant, ""where I learnt what food tastes like"", he set up in 2012 offering a five-course menu that changed every two weeks, a novelty at the time. It has paid off. Today his chef de cuisine, Jay Schwartz, is busy pickling juniper berries and cooking seal ragout with gnocchi, chard and Brussels sprouts. Newfoundland and neighbouring Nova Scotia and Quebec are the only provinces in Canada where restaurants can get a licence to serve wild game. Demand is strong, and locals are also appreciative of traditional dishes. Cod tongues, cheeks and, for some, the sounds (the swim bladder) are considered delicacies, and you can still find seal flipper pie, fish and brewis (hard tack biscuits), and toutons (fried scraps of dough) with molasses. My advice is to start at Bacalao, a restaurant that pioneered ""nouvelle Newfoundland cuisine"" back in 2007. Here, Matt McDonald adapts classic meals such as Jiggs dinner (boiled salt beef with vegetables and pease pudding), pairs chicken with local bakeapples (cloudberries), and uses cod sustainably fished with pots on Fogo Island. There is an obvious concord between the lakes, barrens, forests and wild seashores of Newfoundland and those of Scandinavia. Fittingly, at the next stop on our restaurant crawl, I am served warm madeleines with spruce tip sugar by Mia Boland, who previously worked with Magnus Nilsson at the acclaimed Fäviken in northern Sweden. Opened in May, the Merchant Tavern in Water Street is currently the hottest restaurant in the city, with a menu of Canadian delights that ranges from Nova Scotia sparkling wines and Prince Edward Island beef tartare, to British Columbia albacore tuna with dandelion capers and sliced green strawberries. It is the sort of high-ceilinged, hipster-filled eatery you find in many a big city (yes, it is in an old bank), and a second hit restaurant from sommelier Jeremy Bonia and local chef Jeremy Charles, who are widely credited with putting St John's on the global culinary map. In 2010, they opened Raymonds, a harbour-view restaurant that has since garnered multiple awards and accolades from Canadian reviewers. When I meet Charles, he seems the antithesis of the modern celebrity chef, shy and humble with a thick beard like an old-time gold prospector. It is only when I dine at this warm and elegant establishment, set in a century-old building that was once the headquarters of the Commercial Cable Company, that it becomes clear something exceptional is going on. A seven-course tasting menu at Raymonds costs C$220 per person, including some revelatory wine pairings. What? You've never tried moose, crispy lichen and whipped ricotta with a glass of chilled Tesch Deep Blue blanc de noir? Pity. For me, epiphany comes in the shape of an intriguing twig of Labrador tea (a bush) that skewers a grilled whelk and some seal bresaola, creating the perfect match of strangeness and pleasure. After that, I'm so hooked that if our server described the next course as ""eye of newt, and toe of frog"", I'd still sit there nodding appreciatively. The bad news is you may never get the chance to try this - Raymonds' menus are always changing. ""I've probably eaten here 20 times,"" says McCarthy, ""but I've never had the same dish."" This sense of constant questing is exhilarating, and when dessert arrives, its description, including a companion wine from Pantelleria, unrolls like some heavenly incantation. ""We wanted to do something with wild rose petals,"" explains Peter Burt, the chef de cuisine. ""Our pastry chef had some ideas, so we said go for it."" And so I find myself dining in this beguiling fogtown on the edge of Atlantic Canada, savouring a deliriously good union of dark chocolate and wild rose espuma, spruce tip and milk chocolate streusel, whipped fresh cheese blancmange and sea buckthorn . . . Oh yes. All those rumours about the St John's foodie revolution are true, and the proof is in this pudding. Staying in a 'saltbox' ""We found newspaper cuttings in the walls dating from 1907,"" says Janet Denstedt, co-owner of Aunt Christi's cottage. Set on the water's edge at the end of a quiet road in Greenspond, a small community 400km north of St John's, this whitewashed wooden ""saltbox"" is enjoying a new life as a stylish two-bedroom holiday cottage. The term derives from the similarity in appearance between such buildings and the small wooden boxes with sloping lids that were hung beside a fireplace to keep salt dry. ""All our rental properties are over a century old,"" Denstedt explains, ""and were generally unused or derelict when we discovered them."" The story of the Old Salt Box Co begins in 2007, when she and her partner, Richard Wharton, both from Ontario, started visiting this tranquil corner of Newfoundland on holiday. Their first trip was by motorhome, then they rented cottages, ""but it was hard to find anywhere good"". In 2009 they solved this problem by buying their own saltbox on Fogo Island, and after doing it up in a cheerful style they decided to do it again. The couple now have eight properties, in Twillingate, Fogo, Musgrave Harbour and Greenspond, which have one to three bedrooms and are always in scenic locations. Though traditional outside, inside there are bright Caribbean colours and a clutter-less minimalism, with modern kitchens, restored roll-top baths, and beds with patchwork quilts. Ceilings have been raised, picture windows inserted, wooden floors varnished to an amber-like brilliance. There is free WiFi and Apple TV, although many guests ignore these in favour of the annual parade of icebergs that rolls south from Greenland in May and June, along with whales that blow and breach offshore in July and August. NT The Old Salt Box Co (theoldsaltboxco.com) offers one-bedroom houses from C$170 per night; two-beds from C$180.

Oil crisis leaves the East barreling out of control,NL,"The contents of a family’s life — an oven, a side table, old magazines — are unloaded from a truck into a yard overflowing with pickups, snowmobiles, motorcycles, boats and trailers at Fitzpatrick’s Auctioneers. The lot has become a graveyard for toys that were easily afforded in past lives built on oil money, an elegy for Newfoundland’s crude-tied boom. “It’s amazing. You’d never think what the price of oil could do,” lamented owner Blair Loveless after surveying the stockpiles. The crude crisis has devastated the livelihoods of hundreds of Newfoundlanders working in the industry, whether in the local offshore oil fields or commuting to Alberta’s oilsands. With few work prospects at home, especially after a moratorium on cod fishing in the 1990s put some 30,000 people out of work, Newfoundlanders looked west, where Alberta’s energy sector paid six-figure salaries to attract desperately needed workers. Some 10,000 Newfoundlanders migrated to Alberta, poured hundreds of millions of dollars back home into their island communities. At the same time, Newfoundland’s own offshore industry took off, solidifying the island’s ties to the global oil price. Though Newfoundland is some 6,500 kilometres east of ground zero for Canada’s oil industry, the fallout from the swift and prolonged energy price dive has arguably hit the smaller, less-diversified province even harder than it has hit Alberta. Both oil-dependent economies are in recession and are expected to contract again this year. But crude comprises a slightly larger share of Newfoundland’s GDP and provincial revenues. These days, Alberta oil companies hire locals. One St. John’s business on kijiji is charging $30 a month to Newfoundlanders looking to “rent” an Alberta address and phone number to put on their resumes. At Fitzpatrick’s, the auction, appraisal and liquidation business is up 30 per cent from last winter. About half of that is due to a loss of jobs in Alberta. During the boom, Loveless couldn’t rent an SUV from the St. John’s airport, because they were all booked and paid for, on standby for fly-in executives. Now he visits the airport to appraise trucks for resale, their keys left at an airport hotel by Alberta commuters who can’t afford the payments. “It’s sad. These people never thought the day would come where a barrel of oil would be below $30 (U.S.),” he said. “They were just living for the moment and they were making a huge amount of money and just thought it would continue on.” Everyone in St. John’s — from the repo man to the restaurateur to the food bank manager — knows the price of a barrel of oil. The people in Newfoundland’s biggest city can pinpoint when the bottom began falling out of their economy. It was the summer of 2014, when oil began a decline as steep as the streets sloping down to the St. John’s harbour. Newfoundland is clamouring to avoid becoming the next victim of the resource curse, an affliction that can debilitate booming economies that allow extraction to become the sole driver of prosperity. Oil first flowed here in 1997, ushering in a new era of prosperity that lasted nearly two decades. Newfoundland became a “have” province in 2008 for the first time, and as the local industry grew, those working in Alberta were sending pay cheques back home. House and vehicle sales soared, construction took off and the benefits trickled through the economy. Just like the workers who bought new homes and toys with their newfound oil money, the provincial government saw the sudden influx of revenue as a chance to spend on sorely needed infrastructure and social programs. It did not set aside a rainy-day fund, as Alberta had. “The reliance on oil — and I would argue to the expense of the development of other areas of economic potential — hasn’t set us up well for the situation we’re in now,” said Newfoundland’s newly elected finance minister Cathy Bennett. She outlined the grim situation the government faces to a group of 100 St. John’s residents attending a pre-budget consultation in a high school gym last month. Citizens were asked to brainstorm how to shore up government revenues and cut expenditures, and how the province can innovate to diversify the economy. The government has also asked departments to shave 30 per cent of their costs over the next three years, which could result in job losses. The fallout from the oil crisis — compounded by potential government job cuts — could hit the province worse than the infamous cod moratorium of the 1990s, said Wade Locke, an economics professor at Memorial University. “A 30 per cent cut in government expenditures over three years at a time when the economy is weak because of oil prices and less remittance income from people working in the oilfields in Alberta? “Yes, it’s fair to say it could be harder than the moratorium,” he said. Those affects are being felt now. Fewer blue and orange ice-class cargo ships leave the narrow entry to the St. John’s harbour, loaded with supplies for the rigs 350-kilometres offshore. And with declining output from the three producing rigs and two of four exploration rigs temporarily shut down — two more are scheduled for shutdown in July — helicopters are bringing fewer workers back and forth right now. Still, resilient Newfoundlanders are quick to list off the reasons they believe the downturn could be relatively short-term; that this is the bottom of a typical, albeit particularly painful, commodity cycle. After all, there’s still a great deal of interest in Newfoundland’s offshore oil, which is cheaper and cleaner to extract than oilsands crude. A government land sale in the Flemish Pass basin took in a record $1.2 billion of new oil company spending commitments. There are an estimated 12 billion barrels of oil reserves in that area alone. The province believes the number of job openings will increase beginning in 2019, when it anticipates major project expansion will resume. But Newfoundlanders like Gina Stewart and her husband Sheldon Fuller can’t afford to wait to see whether boom times return to her home province. After being laid off within weeks of one another from well-paid trucking jobs in Alberta, the phone began ringing with calls from debt collectors. They filed for bankruptcy. She figured there was nowhere else to go but home — a province that oil has smarted as badly as the one she left. They took trucking jobs in Newfoundland, but work has been sporadic at best and have yet to see a paycheque that cleared $2,500. They’ve stopped waiting for the dispatcher to call and decided to take a team-driving job hauling goods out of Brampton, Ont., where a low loonie is starting to help create jobs in Canada’s manufacturing heartland. After two weeks of work, they’ve already made more than they did in a month in Newfoundland. But it also means being at home with their three children and her mother just a few days a month. Stewart wrestles with whether they made the right decisions — to move home from Alberta and now to do long-haul shifts across North America — but the changing economic tides have left her little choice. “If you had asked me 15 years ago if I thought the ass was going to fall out of Alberta, no, absolutely not,” she said. “But it happened. It did. And a lot of people are suffering.” The upside of a downturn The fisheries: The fishing industry expects better prices for their products, about 90 per cent of which are exported. The industry saw its export price improve 10 to 15 per cent last year due to the lower dollar, and is optimistic a weak loonie will provide a boost this spring and summer. Tourism: Ask any St. John’s restaurant or bar owner, and they’ll tell you they’re optimistic that this summer is going to be booming with tourists as more Canadians opt for staycations due to the weak loonie and Americans venture north in search of travel deals. The film industry: St. John’s has seen an uptick in film and television shoots. The dropping dollar makes the picturesque province an even more attractive filming location. Jason Momoa, better known as Khal Drogo from Game of Thrones, is filming two projects in the city, and Ethan Hawke was in town in the fall. Clean energy: As the oil crisis rocks other energy producers, St. John’s-based utility giant Fortis Inc. is in expansion mode. It recently paid $6.9 billion (U.S.) for a Michigan-based power company, giving it a much larger footprint in the U.S. electricity market. Life, post-boom The Alberta worker Albert Wakely moved his wife and three young children from Newfoundland to Alberta in 2012 with the promise of doubling his income as a truck driver. “The money was calling,” he said. When Wakely was laid off from a scrapyard job at home, he used his last paycheque to buy a plane ticket to Alberta, with $40 and a credit card in his pocket. He says he was offered a $30-an-hour job “the minute I walked off the plane” delivering chemicals to pipelines to prevent them from freezing. “We had everything,” he says of his family’s life in Innisfail, a town in central Alberta. “I had two vehicles, a quad, a ski-do, a mini-quad for my youngest son. The only thing we never invested in was a new home because we had all the intentions of coming home.” The situation seemed to turn dire overnight. Wakely and his truck driver friends were hearing about layoffs on the rigs last August, but figured their pipeline deliveries were still needed. Then Wakely’s boss called the drivers in for a talk. He told them he didn’t want to choose who had to leave and who could stay, so he told them if they wanted to leave, he’d give them a layoff so they could collect EI. Wakely volunteered. All the other guys were from Alberta; one was expecting a child. He had a life that his wife missed in Newfoundland and the option of finding a job at home. He secured a job at a cleaning company in St. John’s before his layoff. He and his family moved in July to Conception Bay South, 20 kilometres south of St. John’s. He makes $16 an hour and his wife had to get an $11 an hour job to make ends meet. Their combined income is less than the $35 an hour he was making when he left Alberta. He works overnight shifts and she works during the day so that someone is constantly with their 10-month-old. Adjusting to living on less has been difficult. “The spending thing had to stop and that gets addictive, trust me,” he says. The Newfoundland worker Renee Pottle and her boyfriend had planned on starting a family soon — until a global oil crisis interrupted their plans. Pottle, 37, was laid off from her job managing supplies for offshore rigs in September. Her boyfriend worked on the rigs and was laid off a year ago. “Now I’m at this stage in life, at this age — we were in the process of ‘Let’s get a house and start a family’ and now that’s on hold.” Now they’re both at home all day, together, looking for work. “I’m going up one wall and down the other,” she says. For more than a decade, Pottle easily moved between jobs at some of the biggest names in the oil industry. After moving to Alberta in 2005, she climbed the ladder from a cashier at a car dealership to a manufacturing scheduler at Halliburton. “If you didn’t like your job, you quit and you go down the street and you get another one. I’ve never witnessed anything like that before. They were coming at you from all different angles.” Pottle moved back home to St. John’s in 2010 during the height of the province’s oil boom, and easily got a job in the industry — for better money than she was earning in Alberta. She met her boyfriend at work and the two began dating three years ago. Their life was progressing toward building a family until mid-2014, when oil industry cost-cutting put the brakes on their plans. Offshore rigs shut down and her boyfriend lost his job. Work slowed at her supply company, some co-workers left voluntarily, then eight others were laid off. “The rest of us we stuck it out thinking ‘nah, this will bounce’ back but then it got worse … and worse … and worse and worse,” she said. Now, she is competing for jobs she is overqualified for with 500 other applicants and nonenergy employers are reluctant to hire for fear she’ll leave the job once better paying oil gigs are available. She has similar reservations about leaving her decade-long career in the industry. “What if it turns around in the summer and I can’t go back because I’m in school? Or do I just hang around in case it comes back?” The spillover On St. John’s touristy Water St., just down from the pubs holding nightly “screech-ins,” restaurants that once hosted swanky oil exec dinner meetings have shuttered. Landlords can’t find tenants for their executive rental suites, while new home construction has dropped by 20 per cent. Charity events have been cancelled and the food bank faces a downturn in donations from Big Oil. “A lot of businesses are telling us they don’t know if they’ll be around next year,” said Kim Keating, outgoing president of the St. John’s Board of Trade, where 72 per cent of members recently surveyed said conditions are worse than a year ago. “They can directly link between their business and the price of oil because they’re not seeing the clientele they did a year ago.” Here’s a look at how some local businesses have been affected: The bankruptcy and accounting business Insolvency filings are up 22 per cent over the last year at accounting and insolvency firm Noseworthy Chapman. “The trend is really people who were working away who have either had their hours cut or a layoff,” said partner David Howe. “When you go from the salary that an oil worker is making to EI, there’s a huge impact on your cash flow.” There hasn’t been a pickup in commercial insolvencies, but clients are feeling the squeeze from oil companies asking for price reductions. “A lot of times, that makes their margins too thin or non-existent, so then it’s a trickle-down effect because they have to find those savings elsewhere,” Howe said. “So they’ve either got to cut stuff or go to their own suppliers to squeeze them a little bit.” The cargo port The number of ships supplying offshore rigs in the St. John’s harbour has fallen nearly 20 per cent in the past six months. Cargo ships dock about 45 times a month to pick up supplies and drop off waste for the offshore oil rigs. But just six months ago, the number of ships was more than 50, said Geoff Cunningham, director of offshore operations at St. John’s A. Harvey Marine Base. Two of the seven offshore rigs that the base supplied in 2014 have shut down temporarily. The marine base is taking a revenue hit, but so far there have only been a few layoffs, he said. The pub Erin’s Pub, a popular spot for traditional music, helped launch bands like Great Big Sea. Now there are nights with just five customers. Bob Hallett, a member of Great Big Sea who bought the pub in 2012, said that just 18 months ago the bar and his restaurant Tavola were full of oil executives and engineers earning six figures and given big expense accounts. Because they didn’t have their families in St. John’s, they were eating out and going to the pub seven nights a week, he said. “They were reliable, seven-nights-a-week customers, and then they disappeared.” This winter has been even worse for business than the previous one, with business down as much as 25 to 30 per cent, he said. “New Year’s Eve was like a half-decent Friday.” The restaurants At Raymond’s, a gourmet restaurant consistently ranked as one of Canada’s top restaurants, oil industry Christmas parties were virtually non-existent this year. “There’s so much tension right now,” said owner Jeremy Bonia, who believes the worst of the slowdown has yet to sink in.

He’s been trying to find a renter for a condo that rented for $4,800 a month in 2014, and is now priced at $3,500. It has been on the market for seven months. Home sales in St. John’s fell three per cent in December compared to a year earlier, while prices in the province fell 2.4 per cent to $267,093. Housing starts in 2015 were 20 per cent lower than the year before. There are holes in the ground where condo projects have been shelved. Many for-sale signs have a “new price” sticker as sellers reduce expectations. The food bank There was a marked decline in cash donations at the Newfoundland food bank’s 2015 Christmas drive, with some oil companies cutting their contributions in half. “A lot of these companies, the employees have been slashed so there’s less people to give,” said Egbert Walters, general manager, who checks the price of oil along with international news every morning. Food banks in the province provide food to nearly five per cent of people in the province, the second highest level in the country. The February oil and gas food drive will be the real indicator of where budgets stand. There was a decrease in donations last year, when the impact of the oil crisis was just starting to hit. He thinks it could be worse this year. The airport Traffic at the St. John’s airport is down for the first time in more than a decade. The year-over-year decline in 2015 amounted to about four per cent, much of it due to a drop-off in traffic to northern Alberta. The St. John’s airport had 10 weekly chartered flights to bring long-distance commuters from St. John’s to Alberta in 2014. But there have been none since April. WestJet is also seeing a slowdown in demand for flights to Western Canada as fewer islanders commute for jobs. “Atlantic Canada is obviously suffering the same fate as Alberta because it’s so tied to energy,” said CEO Gregg Saretsky."
Temporary foreign workers program faces federal review; Employment minister says ‘there are issues on this program from coast to coast to coast’,NL,"The Liberal government plans to launch a full-scale review of the controversial temporary foreign workers program. MaryAnn Mihychuk, the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Labour, told The Globe and Mail she will ask a parliamentary committee for proposals to fix the program. Reforms passed by the former Conservative government limit foreign workers to 10 per cent of a company’s work force in low-paying jobs, and prohibit employers from hiring them in regions of high unemployment. In most communities with an unemployment rate above 6 per cent, companies cannot qualify for the program. “I think it is timely for a serious review of the whole program,” Ms. Mihychuk said in an interview. “We would like to put it forward to a House committee to review, and there are issues on this program from coast to coast to coast.” A source said Liberal MPs from Atlantic Canada also want cabinet to exempt fish processing plants from the restrictions. Farm workers and live-in caretakers were exempted from the Conservatives’ reforms, but not seafood processors. While the Liberals criticized the Conservative government’s handling of the program, the party did not propose reforms in its 2015 election platform. All seats in Atlantic Canada went to Liberals, and MPs from the region are pressing hard for changes, saying the restrictions hurt seasonal businesses and the service sector. Nova Scotia Liberal MP Rodger Cuzner, who is also Ms. Mihychuk’s parliamentary secretary, said the program needs to be overhauled to take into account the demands of seasonal businesses. “Changes over the last couple of years have impacted seasonal industries. We still generate over 50 per cent of the regional GDP through seasonal industries. The work force is getting older. The out-migration is significant,” he said. Yvonne Jones, the Liberal MP from Labrador, said the changes to the TFW program hurt her province’s tourism and fish processing industries, making it difficult to get seasonal labour. “Because of the fact we are unable to recruit under the temporary foreign worker program, we have seen a lot of businesses having to close or scale back their hours and days of operations. This is really affecting services to communities that need that service,” Ms. Jones said. Conservative MP Jason Kenney, the former minister who overhauled the program, said it would be dumb economic policy to exempt fish plant workers from the terms of the temporary workers program when so many Atlantic Canadians are unemployed and many jobless oil workers are returning from Alberta and Saskatchewan. “This is classic Liberal position. Make it easy for local fish plant workers to go on unemployment insurance and make it easier for the employers to bring in fish plant workers from overseas,” he said. Mr. Kenney said one of the reasons his government tightened the rules for employment insurance and temporary foreign workers was that communities in Atlantic Canada had local fish plant workers collecting employment insurance while foreigners were doing their jobs. Ms. Mihychuk said the review by the Commons employment committee needs to encompass every sector of the economy, including the impact of the collapse in oil prices. “You look at the massive layoffs in Alberta, it’s really changing the labour market,” she said. “A lot of indigenous people are strongly opposed to [TFW], saying it’s time for indigenous people to be given a chance. So there are a lot of different angles to the whole program.” Unemployment among aboriginal people is more than twice the rate for non-aboriginals, according to the 2011 National Household Survey. The Liberals also believe a credible pathway to citizenship for foreign workers is needed. “It’s a situation that is complicated. These are people – excellent people – and a lot of them want to stay in the country,” Ms. Mihychuk added. The Liberals say the Conservatives mismanaged the 2014 reforms and based many of their regional employment assumptions on inaccurate labour market data. “Under the temporary workers program, basically, they connected it to data around employment statistics, but those employment statistics were not completely accurate,” Ms. Jones said. “They looked at large regions as opposed to individual areas where the problem was most sensitive. And because they didn’t go with the [mandatory] long-form census, a lot of the data was incomplete,” she added. Mr. Kenney said the review is unnecessary, saying the reforms he brought in were balanced and well thought-out. “I think our changes have turned out to be prescient given the downturn in the western economy, in particular where the most skilled part [of TFW] was being overused. With over 100,000 Albertans having lost their jobs in the past few months, and if more people were pouring into the Alberta labour market from abroad as de facto indentured workers while many Canadians are facing unemployment, that would be totally unacceptable,” he said. Editor's note: An earlier online version of this article incorrectly referred to an employment rate of 6 per cent in the third paragraph. This version has been corrected to show that it is the unemployment rate. Globe and Mail Update"
Conference Board expects B.C. to lead growth among the provinces this year,NL,"OTTAWA _ A new report by the Conference Board of Canada says strong economic growth in British Columbia is expected to lead to a wave of migration from provinces hit by low oil prices. Strength in housing, tourism and manufacturing is expected to help push the province to 2.7 per cent growth in 2016 _ the highest of any province. ""This will encourage more Canadians _ particularly those in the struggling oil-producing provinces _ to move to British Columbia,'' the report said. The report released Tuesday forecasts net migration of roughly 20,000 people to B.C. this year as low oil and gas prices persist. Alberta is expected to be hardest hit by the energy slump, with the economy forecast to contract by 1.1 per cent this year after a 2.9 per cent pullback last year. ""With oil prices continuing to feel the pressure of bloated global inventories and rising supply, the outlook is grim for the energy sector and Alberta's economy as a whole,'' said Marie-Christine Bernard, associate director of provincial forecasts at the Ottawa-based think tank. ""The impact on jobs, housing markets, consumer spending and supplier industries will result in continued recession for Alberta this year,'' said Bernard. Alberta's unemployment rate rose to 7.4 per cent in January and the Conference Board says it will continue to rise in the first half of the year, before gradually falling as discouraged workers stop looking for work and more people leave the province. Low oil and gas prices are also expected to weigh on Newfoundland and Labrador, which is expected to see no growth after a 5.4 per cent contraction last year, and Saskatchewan which is expected to creep ahead by 0.7 per cent after a contraction of 2.8 per cent in 2015. The Conference Board said that aside from B.C., only Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia are expected to grow by more than two per cent this year. Ontario is projected to grow by 2.4 per cent, as the lower Canadian dollar and U.S. consumer demand is expected to help boost exports."
The have-not headaches are back,NL,"Rick Farrell was among hundreds who lost their jobs in December when the shipyard where they worked finished making a gigantic module for Newfoundland and Labrador's fourth offshore oil field – Hebron. Unlike previous years when unemployed tradespeople could easily find work in Alberta, that was no longer an option with oil prices plunging. The layoffs hit Mr. Farrell's hometown of Marystown hard and rippled across Newfoundland's Burin peninsula, hurting the local businesses and small communities that dot the province's southern coast. “It was the biggest layoff we had in many years,"" said the 52year-old Mr. Farrell. “We could be a year without work in sight."" After riding the oil boom for more than a decade, Newfoundland and Labrador is facing a dire economy and a return to the days when it was the archetypal “have-not"" province. It's getting hit on all sides. Multibillion-dollar projects such as Hebron are either completed or close to completion. Iron ore mines are shuttered and the weak oil price has pushed the province's deficit to a staggering $2-billion – a record amount. And more pain is on the way. Tax hikes and job cuts are expected when the province unveils its coming budget. A fifth of the energy sector has been laid off and the misery has spread to other parts of the economy, from cabbies to waitresses. The unemployment rate is 14.1 per cent, the highest among the provinces. “It's just getting worse,"" said Bernie Johnson, a welder in St. John's who has been out of work for nearly a year. “Everything has dried up. There are more layoffs coming."" ‘Have-not will be no more' Ever since it joined confederation in 1949, Newfoundland and Labrador has been searching for a way to earn its keep. First came fisheries, which were decimated with the depletion of cod stocks and ensuing moratorium in 1992. Then there was Churchill Falls, a massive hydroelectric project that was supposed to provide untold wealth, only to end in a bad deal with Quebec. And then there was oil. “It was sold to you that this is the saviour,"" said Sean Wiltshire, 45, who has lived in Newfoundland most of his life and runs Avalon employment agency. Ingrained in Mr. Wiltshire‘s memory are the words from former premier Brian Peckford that “some day the sun will shine and have-not will be no more."" Billions of barrels of crude lie beneath the ocean off Newfoundland's shores. Over the two to four decades it took to turn the province's mammoth oil discoveries into production, the price of crude swung wildly. It traded around $30 (U.S.) a barrel in the early 1980s, dropped below $10 in 1986 and rose to more than $100 in 2014. Now it is trading around $40. The White Rose, Terra Nova and Hibernia offshore oil fields were already in production and crude was soaring when former premier Danny Williams fought Ottawa and the energy industry for a greater share of the oil revenue. The province went into overdrive after Mr. Williams and Exxon Mobil Corp. reached an agreement in August, 2007, to build Hebron – a $14-billion project. At the same time as Hebron was being developed, Vale SA's nickel processing plant in Long Harbour and the government's Muskrat Falls hydroelectric facility in Labrador were also under construction. To accommodate the hundreds of additional labourers, engineers and executives moving to St. John's to work on these projects, new offices, housing and restaurants popped up, including upscale restaurants and luxury condos with a view of the harbour. “When oil started to rise, everything was possible. New jobs, high-paying jobs. Things started to change,"" Mr. Wiltshire said. “People felt like we were playing catch-up. You had better opportunities when oil was higher."" The average weekly paycheque in the province rose 70 per cent to $991 (Canadian) over the boom years, higher than the national average. For miners and oil-and-gas workers, average earnings skyrocketed to $2,048 a week. People started migrating to the province for the first time in decades. The influx of workers boosted demand for housing: The average house price increased to $284,000 from $104,000 over the oil bull market, according to Canadian Real Estate Association data. “There would be bidding wars. Here. I mean I had never heard of that,"" said Elizabeth Lawrence, director of strategy with the City of St. John's. The decade-long bull market in oil and other commodities propelled the province into “have"" status in 2008 for the first time in its history. Instead of receiving payments from Ottawa to help pay for services, Newfoundland and Labrador started contributing to the equalization pot. Delinquent debt on rise Lofty oil prices overshadowed some early warning signs. A slowdown in the iron ore industry started a few years ago and one of Labrador's key iron ore mines was closed in 2014, putting hundreds of people out of work. Then as the price of oil dropped, companies and projects in the energy sector that had looked so promising were suddenly announcing layoffs and closings. Nearly 3,000 Newfoundlanders and Labradorians in the mining and oil industry lost work over the past year and a half and prospects are grim. Bernie Johnson has applied for nearly 200 jobs in and outside of his industry. “I still haven't got a phone call from nobody. It's bad,"" he said. A single father, Mr. Johnson said he is worried all the time. “Every day to every day you are looking at your bank account. Literally,"" he said. Mr. Johnson paid for his offshore oil training on the promise from a local company that he would get hired. But once he completed the training last summer, there were no jobs. Like many others, Mr. Johnson is facing rising debts. Delinquency rates on loans and credit cards rose 20.5 per cent in St. John's and 12 per cent across the province last year. Signs of the slowdown can be seen almost everywhere. On a recent February evening, the main street in downtown St. John's was desolate. Most restaurants were empty with servers hovering around the bar. Andrea Maunder, the owner of Bacalao, a downtown restaurant, said regular customers come in less and don't order as much. Christmas dinner parties became Christmas lunches. She has had to cut her staff's hours. Jackie Anderson, who has worked in the restaurant business for two years, said February is normally a slow month but not this slow. Now she sometimes doesn't get a single table for lunch. One of her regular customers used to order an appetizer, a main dish and a drink. Now he orders soup and water. She used to get 15 per cent in tips and recently had a customer tip her 7 per cent. “That's how bad it is,"" she said. Cabbies have seen their businesses drop by as much as half. One driver was out for 19 hours and made $3 an hour. Cabbies used to be able to count on more lucrative trips to the airport but those customers disappeared along with the direct flights between St. John's and Fort McMurray, Alta. “It's slow,"" said Don Butler, a cab driver for 20 years whose car was among a long line of taxis close to the popular bar-filled George Street. “People are not moving."" The condo market is also easing. Condos used to get snapped up as soon as they went up for sale, but many have been sitting on the market for months, including one replete with a wine cellar. One strip of dilapidated buildings was supposed to become a cluster of high-end condos. But one of the structures is now slated to become an apartment building and another is a parking lot. Throughout the city there are indications that construction has slowed: an empty hole that was destined to be a condo; a person taking down a sign for a gleaming building that was never built. Although house sales are up year over year, there is uncertainty in the air as Newfoundlanders and Labradorians wait for the province to unveil its budget. “People are holding off right now because of potential layoffs with the government,"" said Larry Hann, a real estate agent with Hann Group, which specializes in condos and houses. Mr. Hann is optimistic for the future because of the huge offshore oil finds, but said: “In a couple of years' time, unless we get another major oil project, there is going to be a lot of inventory sitting around empty."" Commercial real estate vacancy rates rose to 7.7 per cent last year from 4.8 per cent in the previous year, according to Turner Drake & Partners Ltd., an Atlantic Canada real estate consultancy. Seventeen new office buildings were erected and expanded over the past few years, including the addition of two shiny office towers in the downtown core the same year oil started to tank. “There was an increase in supply at the exact same time when the initial sense of a decrease in demand was occurring,"" said Charlie Oliver, a commercial real estate veteran of 35 years with Martek Morgan Finch Inc. Still, Mr. Oliver said he is not seeing a lot of vacant space because many of the big oil companies are locked into their leases for another year. “The biggest challenge is going to be in the large blocks of space which will be coming onto the market this time next year,"" Mr. Oliver said. “We are still at the stage of uncertainty rather than reality of what is going to be vacant."" A hit to provincial finances The recently elected provincial Liberal government is now scrambling to meet the dual challenge of stimulating the economy and reducing the deficit. Credit-rating agencies have downgraded Newfoundland and Labrador's debt and changed their outlook from “stable"" to “negative,"" which could eventually drive up borrowing costs at a time when the province has little spare cash. The credit agencies won't upgrade their ratings until the province improves its finances. “It is one thing to say that you are willing to or looking at making changes and another to actually implement the changes,"" said Michael Yake, senior credit analyst with Moody's Investors Service. The deficit is on track to balloon to $2.4-billion next year and will remain close to $2-billion annually for years if trends hold. About one-third of the province's revenue has traditionally come from oil royalties. That amount dropped to $551.8-million from $1.2-billion when the province updated its budget for fiscal 2015-16, due to weak crude prices and declining production from mature oil fields such as Hibernia. Finance Minister Cathy Bennett knows she doesn't have much time. She has spoken to the province's major lenders and bond agencies and said she has heard their message. “It is not an option for us to take two years to get to a credible plan,"" Ms. Bennett said in an interview in St. John's. “We have been very clear with the people of the province and with the bond-rating agencies that we intend to introduce a very credible plan as part of our budget."" The Liberals campaigned on the promise not to cut public sector jobs or raise the HST, which at 13 per cent is among the lowest in the Atlantic provinces. But since coming into power in December, the government has changed its tune. Now a tax hike and job cuts are expected. The provincial government has directed its staff to find ways to reduce expenditures by a third, a worrying scenario for teachers, civil servants and other public sector workers. “There's no way to avoid people losing their jobs,"" said Jerry Earle, the president of NAPE, the province's largest public sector union whose members include social workers and highway maintenance workers. Newfoundland's public sector comprises a quarter of the province's work force, higher than the national average of 20 per cent. The bulk of the 60,000 jobs are in hospitals, health care and social assistance, while the rest are in schools and the government. Like Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador will receive a cash infusion of $30-million from an emergency federal program designed to help provinces during sharp economic downturns. As for the more contentious “equalization"" payment, the province said it will not be receiving those subsidies any time soon because of a lag in the way the payments are calculated and administered. “It is worth a reminder that Newfoundland and Labrador does not receive equalization payments now,"" the province's Premier Dwight Ball said in an interview in St. John's. The other Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, along with Ontario and Quebec, are still in “have-not"" status, due to the calculation lag. But because the formula for payments has already been set for the next few years, Newfoundland and Labrador will not qualify. “Of course we would like to see the formula changed so we can use that money to provide those benefits,"" Mr. Ball said. “But the future for Newfoundland and Labrador as we work our way out of this is not going to be receiving equalization cheques from Ottawa."" Exacerbating the situation is the province's vast land, sparse population and rapidly aging demographics. There is a fear that the fiscal mess will lead to another exodus, similar to what happened when Ottawa closed the province's cod fisheries in 1992. That year marked the province's peak population with 580,000 people. But the cod moratorium decimated fishing communities and Newfoundlanders fled to other parts of Canada looking for work. Most never returned and today the population is 527,000, with more than a quarter over the age of 60. In Burgeo, one of Newfoundland's many remote and tiny communities, two-thirds of the population is over the age of 55. It is common here for residents to drive 10 hours for a 15-minute doctor's appointment in the capital. During winter months, the only road to Burgeo can be closed because of white-out conditions. Burgeo's mayor is worried about the looming cuts. “Smaller communities require a bit of extra to provide services. Many times they are looked to to provide the cuts,"" said Barbara Barter, who volunteers as the mayor and used to work as a full-time teacher. And as services disappear, people leave. Sharlene Hinz, who runs Aunt Edna's Boarding House B&B; on Little Bay Island, is considering selling her bed and breakfast after the designated ferry to her island was cancelled. About 100 people – tourists included – live there during the short summer. Located off the northern coast of Newfoundland, Little Bay used to be one of the province's fishing communities. But its crab processing plant, which was the island's main employer, closed about five years ago. Then its only store disappeared along with its direct ferry. Without regular access, it now takes residents a full day to go grocery shopping. “I don't think the small communities should be closed. At the same time, without young people, that is what's going to happen. Everyone dies,"" Ms. Hinz, 62, said over the phone from Vancouver Island where she lives off season. There are two students and a teacher on the island of mostly senior citizens. Big projects wind down Although St. John's has a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent, the provincewide rate is 14.1 per cent, up from 12.3 per cent mid-2014. And the rate could go higher as major construction projects begin to wind down. Construction at Hebron and Muskrat Falls will be wrapping up over the next two years, which will lead to even more job losses. Hebron employed 5,300 at the height of construction and will need a fraction of that work force to operate the rig once it is in production in 2017. Vale hired as many as 6,000 people to build its nickel plant and now requires only 750 workers to operate it. Muskrat Falls employed about 5,000 at its peak and by the time it starts producing electricity in 2018, will only need about 70 people to run the equipment. About $30-billion will have been invested in the province to erect Hebron, the nickel plant and Muskrat Falls. The bulk of the funding for the electricity project was by taxpayers and it is unknown whether it will be profitable. “It's certainly a transformative project for the electricity market and important contributor to the Newfoundland economy,"" said Finn Poschmann, chief executive officer with the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council. “The probability of it being a profitable investment in the medium term for the province is dicey."" The province is waiting to see how the federal government allocates $60-billion in infrastructure spending in its budget on Tuesday, half of which was a campaign promise to help bolster Canada's sluggish economy. The Premier is hoping Ottawa will be flexible on how and where the money is spent. “It is important that we have infrastructure projects ready to keep our work force working,"" Mr. Ball said. The government and business community talk about diversifying the province's economy. They see many opportunities in agriculture, aquaculture, mining, forestry and technology, although they still envisage the province as a destination for oil companies. Tanks belonging to Irving Oil dot the picturesque landscape of St. John's and the offshore supply ships sit in the city's harbour, a constant reminder of the province's dependency on crude. The government and its residents are hoping for another big project. Statoil ASA, the Norwegian oil giant, and other big oil producers recently paid $1.2-billion to explore for oil in the Flemish Pass basin, which contains at least 12 billion barrels of oil and dwarfs the province's producing basin Jeanne d'Arc. Statoil recently found Bay du Nord, hailed as one of the biggest deep-water oil discoveries in decades However, a Bay du Nord project is far from a done deal. No one knows how long it will take to delineate the resource or how long it will take for oil prices to recover to a level where it makes sense to develop the Flemish Pass. “Yes we are in a little bit of doldrums that no one anticipated. Maybe in some ways, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy,"" said St. John's Mayor Dennis O'Keefe. But he added: “The future of Newfoundland and Labrador is very, very bright. Ultimately we will be the energy powerhouse of North America."" Newfoundland and Labrador…s economic pieces Offshore oil plays JEANNE D…ARC BASIN 1,25 billion barrels of oil already produced 2,35 billion discovered but not yet produced FLEMISH PASS BASIN 12 billion barrels of oil in resource RECENT DISCOVERIES Bay du Nord: 300 to 600 million barrels recoverable Mizzen: 100 to 200 million barrels recoverable Harpoon: TBD Oil and gas discovery, exploration, licence and claims zones 1 Hibernia: Discovery 1979, Production 1997. 2 Terra Nova: Discovery 1984, Production 2002. 3 White Rose; Discovery 1984, production 2005.

"Commodities price collapse hurting Canadian incomes, BoC official says; Days when crude was selling for more than $100 (U.S.) a barrel and commodities dominated Canada’s exports and investors may be gone for a long time, deputy governor Lynn Patterson says",NL,"OTTAWA -- The aftershocks of the commodities price collapse, already plucking $1,800 a year out of Canadians’ pockets, could persist for more than two years and permanently impair the economy. That’s the conclusion of the Bank of Canada, based on the central bank’s latest economic modelling. The full impact of the hit to Canadian incomes is “gradually building” and will get worse before it gets better, Deputy Governor Lynn Patterson warned in a speech in Edmonton on Wednesday. “We expect it to become the dominant source of drag on the economy by 2017,” Ms. Patterson said. “As their wealth and income decline, households will likely restrain their spending and we will see lower, but still positive consumer growth.” The bank’s “best guess” is that full adjustment to the collapse in the price of oil and other commodities will take “longer than two years,” she said. “It won’t be easy and it will take time,” she added. The days when crude was selling for more than $100 (U.S.) a barrel and commodities dominated Canada’s exports and investors may be gone for a long time, Ms. Patterson suggested. She said it’s “highly unlikely” that oil will regain its 2014 highs “in the coming years.” Nonetheless, Mr. Patterson said the risk on oil prices is “tilted to the upside” in the medium term. The same goes for the commodity sector’s share of Canadian exports and investments, which topped-out in 2014 at 50 per cent and 56 per cent, respectively. By 2020, commodities’ share of exports investment will sink to 40 per cent, remaking the economic landscape. “Canada’s economy is diverse and dynamic enough to achieve, in time, a new balance of economic growth,” she said. The bank says it will revise its forecast of future economic growth to take into account the various fiscal measures in the March 22 federal budget, including billions of dollars in new infrastructure spending. The bank is currently calling for GDP growth of 1.5 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 2017. That’s already markedly stronger than the 1.4-per-cent growth for 2016 and 2.2-per-cent for 2017, predicted by Finance Minister Bill Morneau in his budget. Ms. Patterson did say that Canada may be adjusting to the economic shift “more quickly than we have historically.” Signs of adjustment are everywhere. The movement of workers out of Alberta and the cheaper Canadian dollar, now at about 77 cents (U.S.), is a help. She said tourism is booming and a record numbers of films are being shot in British Columbia, while the weaker dollar is making non-commodity exports much more competitive. “We are already seeing shifts in migration patterns,” Ms. Patterson pointed out. One of the main beneficiaries is Ontario, which saw the largest inflow of migrants from other provinces since 2002. Meanwhile, the flow of commuting workers, from Atlantic Canada and elsewhere, has fallen sharply, she said. The overall impact of the commodities price collapse knocks a percentage point off GDP. But there is a wide divergence in the effects across the country. Nearly 70,000 jobs have vanished in the three main energy-producing provinces – Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador – pushing the jobless rate up by 2 to 3 percentage points. But elsewhere in the country – most notably Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia – unemployment is flat or declining. Globe and Mail Update"
What's making news in Atlantic Canada,NL,"POLICE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE COLLISION THAT KILLED THREE IN N.B. RCMP say it's not yet clear what caused a crash at a New Brunswick intersection that left two young women and a baby boy dead. Constable Donnie Robertson says the intersection north of Salisbury, at Homestead Road and Route 112, has two stop signs and a flashing light, and he adds alcohol is not believed to be a factor. Robertson says all three of the dead -- an 18-year-old woman from Lewis Mountain, a 24-year-old woman from Moncton and the one-year-old baby -- were in the car. A 24-year-old man and a three-year-old boy were taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, while a man who was driving the pickup truck was treated and released. P.E.I. GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR POPULATION BOOST IN THRONE SPEECH After years of watching its young people leave the province in search of work, Prince Edward Island is making plans to entice some of them back. The province said in its throne speech today that it wants to grow the population of Canada's smallest province to 150,000 people by the end of next year. It's putting together a long-term strategy to repatriate, recruit and retain a skilled workforce, with an overall target of bringing in 3,500 more people. One pilot project will try to connect hundreds of post-secondary international students with Island employers, while another will provide instruction on computer coding in Island schools. MAN GETS 10-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER OF TWO KIDS A 46-year-old New Brunswick man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the attempted murders of two children. RCMP say the Belledune man was charged following an investigation into a November 3rd incident in Blackland. Mounties say a man and two children were taken to hospital after a vehicle went off the road and it was determined the children had been given a noxious substance. The man pleaded guilty in February to two counts of attempted murder while charges of administering a noxious thing were withdrawn. There is a court-imposed publication ban on the identities of the man and the children. ECONOMIC FORECAST GETS WORSE FOR N.L., BETTER FOR MARITIME PROVINCES TD Bank's latest provincial economic growth outlook says the negative effect of low oil prices is expected to deepen in Newfoundland and Labrador. The report says aging oil and gas fields, an ongoing rout in commodity prices and government restraint have led to a multi-year downturn in the province's economy. The bank says it's maintaining a weak outlook for Newfoundland and Labrador, with the economy likely to contract by one per cent this year before eking out a modest gain of 1.1 per cent in 2017. A brighter outlook is given for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick due to their exports to the U.S., and in Prince Edward Island, where TD says tourism is forecast to expand this year and next. N.L. OFFICER TO STAND TRIAL FOR ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT A Royal Newfoundland Constabulary officer accused of sexual assault has been committed to stand trial at Supreme Court. Constable Carl Snelgrove was charged last year in connection with an alleged on-duty incident in late 2014. The 39-year-old officer has been suspended without pay as a result of the allegation against him. Judge James Walsh decided today following a preliminary inquiry that there is enough evidence to proceed to trial, and Snelgrove will be arraigned at Supreme Court next month. P.E.I. WOMAN CHARGED AFTER RASH OF GAS-AND-DASHES Mounties say a Prince Edward Island woman is facing charges in connection with multiple gas-and-dash thefts at a Stratford gas station. Investigators say the alleged incidents took place last month. RCMP said they were concerned for public safety because the driver was seen recklessly speeding out of the parking lot after the thefts. A 21-year-old Hunter River woman is to appear in court on May 9."
In the passenger seat and off the grid on Alaska's remote Dalton Highway,NL,"Although it was early June, snowflakes were drifting down the unforgiving slopes of the slate-gray canyon. The only way up the Chandalar Shelf was a muddy, washboard-like gravel road with sheer drop-offs on our right. Our driver checked the CB radio. No one was heading down the hill, so at 15 mph, our van crept up the narrow S-curve into a cloud. A golden plover flew in front of us and posed on a snow-covered rock. We were 4,738 feet up and, had Atigun Pass not been fogged in, the view over the Brooks Range would have been spectacular. Everything about Alaska is big, including the supersize mountain ranges and a wilderness so vast that many of its peaks have no names. We were driving the Dalton Highway, last frontier of the Last Frontier, on a 414-mile road trip across northern Alaska. Alongside it is the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, a major feat of engineering that was built in just over three years, from 1974 to 1977, and at its height was pumping 2 million barrels of oil a day. In the months before this trip, I had been teaching journalism at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and had heard stories of an industrial highway that wound through the top third of the state. People told me of its sweeping mountain ranges, brilliant northern lights, millions of acres of tundra and caribou herds, all ending at the Arctic Ocean. Ever hear of the boreal forest that circles the northern third of the globe? This road goes through it. And so I signed up for a tour of one of America's most remote highways. The James B. Dalton Highway is named after an early Arctic engineer and referred to as ""the Dalton."" Many locals call it the Haul Road. It has a reputation for blowing out tires, not to mention the avalanches, steep grades and speeding trucks that throw up enough gravel to crack your windshield. The road hit the news last spring when flooding near its terminus at Prudhoe Bay closed it for 18 days. I picked the Northern Alaska Tour Co., which was advertising 2½-day trips up the road. They would do the driving, put us up for two nights, then fly us back from Deadhorse, a commercial settlement a few miles from the Arctic Ocean. We met our guide, Robert Weeden, on a cloudy June morning at the company's offices near the Fairbanks airport. It was 56 degrees out, the warmest we'd be for the entire trip. Our Ford Escape van was equipped with snacks, bug repellent, a satellite phone and a CB radio. Six passengers - a couple from Taiwan, two women from New Zealand, a man from Chicago and me - clambered in to head 73 miles up the Elliott Highway, the feeder road to the Dalton. Within a few miles, we were off the power grid and bereft of any decent Internet connections. Following us the whole way was the pipeline, snaking up and down mountains like a silver ribbon. Building it was quite a process. From the time the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System was approved in 1968, it had taken several years to settle Native American land claims and get the necessary permits to build a road through 40 million acres of wilderness. Before an 800-mile pipeline could be built over three mountain ranges and 30-some rivers and streams, a road had to be built to maintain the pipeline plus get workers, heavy equipment and supplies to the North Slope oil fields. They couldn't be boated in, and it was too dangerous and expensive to fly. They had to be trucked in. And that is how this massive route over the Yukon, one of the country's largest and most remote rivers, came to be. Seventeen billion barrels of oil and 41 years later, the industrial supply route has turned into an artery for thousands of tourists, researchers, wildlife biologists, trekkers, artists and hunters. There are no ATMs, hospitals, banks or grocery stores in this wilderness of taiga, deciduous and muskeg forest. Once on the Dalton, we pulled aside briefly at Milepost 76 to touch one of the 78,000 supports for the pipeline, which is 10 feet above the ground. Designed to last 30 years, it has lasted for almost 40. Oil companies have agreed to remove the pipe when oil runs out, but the Haul Road will stay put. Then we drove over the only bridge in the United States that spans the Yukon, the third largest river on the continent but one that most Americans never see. I walked down its stony bank and found the water silty and frigid to the touch. Squatted next to the river was the Yukon River Camp, where there's gas and rooms in what looked like a bunch of beige freight containers. We stopped for lunch at a cheery cafe with red-and-white-checked curtains, where we were waited on by a Virginian who was the first of many seasonal people we met working for the summer in rural Alaska. He found the job on CoolWorks.com, a site for work in exotic locales. Across the parking lot were bluebells, cottony willow plants, white-flowered Labrador tea, mountain avens and blue forget-me-nots. A ways down the road we found equally varied botany: dwarf willows, crowberry plants and alpine bearberry shrubs that would turn crimson in two months. Spring, summer and fall are compressed here. Tons of blueberries appear in July, but by mid-August, the light is fading and the first frosts start to hit. During the rest of the year, the foxes, voles and ptarmigan that survive here endure several feet of snow, 80-degrees-below-zero winters and hurricane-force winds. As do the truckers. We would see them fly by in a cloud of gravel, and Weeden always pulled over so they would not have to slow down. The rules of the road are that the truckers' needs come first, as they haul everything - food, pipes, chemicals, boats - to the oil camps, then haul the trash back to Fairbanks. They're the legendary folks of this area, immortalized in reality shows such as ""Ice Road Truckers"" and ""America's Toughest Jobs."" For such an isolated piece of real estate, there were a fair number of public restrooms along the way, plus exhibits explaining the wildlife, botany or history of the pipeline. I noticed how Weeden never went over 50 mph and often drove much slower than that to avoid getting a flat tire. We pulled up to the official marker for the Arctic Circle, the point at 66.33 degrees latitude where the sun stays above the horizon the whole day during the summer solstice (June 21) and stays below the horizon on the winter solstice (Dec. 21). Weeden produced a red carpet bisected by a white dotted line to show our ceremonial crossing, and we all laughed and snapped photos. From there we could see the first peaks of the Brooks Range glinting in the sunlight, a fantastical sight like some ancient Tolkienesque tableau. Just before 7 p.m., we entered its gentle U-shaped emerald and brown valleys shaped by glaciers. These were once the bottoms of ancient oceans. We began to climb. The peaks swept up in graceful waves, and the early-evening sun glinted on far-off peaks. We were at 67.15 degrees latitude three weeks before the solstice, so it was quite light out. We pulled into Coldfoot, population 10, which is so named because of the gold miners who showed up a century ago and then got cold feet at the thought of wintering there. Our lodgings were old pipeline-construction housing at a spot at Milepost 175 called the Coldfoot Camp. Its two drab corridors included a laundry room, TV room and a place to leave muddy shoes at the entrance. The bathroom and shower were down the hall. At the no-frills Trucker's Cafe across the driveway, a large bowl of chili was only $4.95. After dinner, we all crowded into the modern visitor center across the street to hear a presentation from a local ranger. ""Life is hanging on the edge here,"" Heidi Schoppenhorst told us. ""The climate is changing. The last few years, we've gotten a lot of precipitation in June, which causes things to grow more. It's making a big difference to have less snow here."" Temps were in the 40s the next morning, so off went the light raincoat and on went the ski jacket and scarf. An ominous sign, ""Next services 240 miles,"" warned us as we set out that we were on our own. We headed down a side road lined with cottonwoods and willows to Wiseman, population 13, a town settled in 1908 by gold miners. We toured a chapel and cabins that looked like movie sets with their ancient stoves. Jack Reakoff, a trapper who hunts wolf, fox, lynx, martin and wolverine, gave us an entertaining spin on life where it's below freezing for seven months and in the minus-40s for weeks on end. ""There's only 34 mammals here because of the severe climate,"" he told us. All students in this part of the state are home-schooled, he added, as 10 kids are required for a school. Reakoff boasted that Wiseman has the most intense aurora displays in the state and that the spring equinox is the best time for it. Visitors, many of them Japanese, will fly in for two or three days, stay at one of the two bed and breakfasts in town and luxuriate in the brilliant night colors. By Milepost 204, we were approaching Sukakpak Mountain, a massive rock wall rising 4,459 feet. The road had reverted to packed mud. Bright-violet lupine bloomed everywhere, and more peaks came into view, though at odd angles. Then we drove by a frozen debris lobe, one of many huge clumps of partly frozen dirt and rubble called ""geohazards"" because they are slow landslides carrying an immense volume of material. Scientists and geologists brought in to examine 23 such lobes near the highway haven't a clue what to do about them other than move the highway 400 feet to the west. But that would only buy a little bit of time if these lobes, which we stopped to gape at, keep moving. One of them has averaged 150 feet per year over three years. The closest one, containing 22,000 tons of debris, was 85 feet high and only 128 feet away from the highway. We were following the Dietrich River at this point, and as we climbed, the snow line crept down like confectioners' sugar on dark-green and brown hills. Then came the climb up the Chandalar Shelf, a 10 percent incline up a cliff. It was my turn to be up front for the terrifying trip. From there, we headed over Atigun Pass and across a plateau, halting at Galbraith Lake for lunch, as there's a picnic area with toilets there. Snowflakes continued to float lazily through the air, and our guide suggested that the cold weather was a blessing - otherwise we'd be swarmed by mosquitoes. White Dall sheep stared down at us from a high ridge. The region was covered by warm, shallow seas back in the Precambrian and Paleozoic eras, which is why we found plenty of fossils in the creek bed. At this point of the Dalton, the eastern edges of Gates of the Arctic National Park are only a few miles from the western edge of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. We next headed through the tundra. When we walked around, it was like treading on sponges. The North Slope, which undulated in graceful green and brown curves to the north, would take us six hours to cross. Clumped around the silver pipeline were musk oxen, one of the hardiest mammals on Earth in terms of their ability to withstand cold climates. We found a herd of 17 near a stop known as Happy Valley. The Dalton was now a huge gravel-and-asphalt trail through an Arctic swamp. Around us was wetland 8 to 10 inches deep, and underneath that, permafrost, some of it 2,000 feet thick. We could see loons, Canada geese and caribou. As the Franklin Bluffs - slate-gray hills with snowy peaks - hove into view, Weeden told us the history of Sir John Franklin's ill-fated 1845 Northwest Passage expedition. Then, 20 miles out of Deadhorse, at Milepost 394, we saw a flagman overseeing the re-graveling of the road, which was closed for two weeks last May because of flooding. Sea gulls appeared in the marsh, and my iPhone buzzed. For the first time since Fairbanks, there was Internet. We came into Deadhorse, which is built on a group of large gravel pads. On them were rows of dump trucks, cranes, buses, plows, drill rigs, derricks, forklifts and miles of pipeline and cable. All the cars in sight were a dirty brown, as water is expensive and dirty water, we were told, must be collected and taken to Fairbanks. We pulled into our lodgings, a two-story building known as Deadhorse Camp that looks like a large container. (There are other hotels in town, such as the newly built Aurora, which gets kudos on Yelp but fills up quickly with oil-field workers.) After we threw our bags into our rooms, we met in a small canteen serving meat-and-potatoes dishes, with few fruits and vegetables in sight. Here, ""you take what you get,"" the cook told us. After dinner, we drove around to see a massive hardware store that has to be one of the best-supplied outlets in the world. It's open 24 hours for whatever needs come up on the oil patch. Deadhorse is the bedroom community for the area, and some 6,000 people work there in 12-hour shifts, two weeks on and two weeks off. We went to bed with the sun - well above the horizon - shining through our windows. On our final day, we jumped into a shuttle van (which came with our tour but which other riders could pay $69 to join) for a trip to the Arctic coast, in closed-off Prudhoe Bay. When we asked the guide why access to the beach is limited, his response was ""Because of 9/11."" America's oil production facilities might be a sitting duck for someone determined to wreak destruction. Everyone had to present identification to be allowed in. The guide mentioned that grizzlies and polar bears show up in town in April and at the end of August. During our time there, we saw swans and king eider ducks, sandhill cranes, sandpipers, pintailed ducks, spectacled eider and gulls everywhere. In July, thousands of caribou wander through town. People from Belgium and Germany joined us on the bus and told us they had camped their way up the Dalton. We pulled up to the driftwood-strewn beach. The clear blue sky and the Beaufort Sea - with pack ice out some 30 feet from the shore - merged at the horizon near the top of the world. One of the Germans donned a two-piece suit and jumped into the frigid water; she lasted maybe 30 seconds. We posed for group pictures, then headed for the tiny airport, where a nine-seater took two hours to fly us over the tundra and jagged peaks and past the undulating hills back to Fairbanks.

Why Arctic cruises are bad for the environment,NL,"Arctic cruises are the latest thing in high-end tourism. Icebergs, polar bears, beluga whales, awe-inspiring vistas and isolated Inuit communities – what's not to like for the jaded traveller? This summer, thousands of people will sail the Arctic's increasingly ice-free waters. At the very top end, the world's most luxurious cruise ship, the Crystal Serenity, will traverse the Northwest Passage from Anchorage to New York. The 1,070 passengers will pay up to $120,000 (U.S.) for the privilege. But here's the thing: Arctic cruises involve greater hazards and environmental impact than just about any other kind of tourism. Among the hazards are small chunks of icebergs called “growlers"" that are exceptionally hard and float low in the water, making them difficult to spot. In 2007, a small ice-strengthened expedition cruise ship struck a growler and sank during an Antarctic voyage, in conditions similar to those now found in the Arctic. And while climate change is melting the sea ice, which forms on the surface of the ocean in winter, icebergs are actually increasing in number, as melt water lubricates the movement of land-based glaciers into the sea. Running aground is another hazard, given that Arctic waters are poorly charted. And Arctic weather is unpredictable and often severe. “Icing,"" caused by ocean spray freezing onto the superstructure of a ship, is of particular concern because it can destabilize and even capsize a vessel. Yet search-and-rescue systems would be overwhelmed by any accident in the Arctic involving more than a few dozen people. The Canadian Forces' search-andrescue helicopters sometimes require two days to reach the Northwest Passage from their bases in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and British Columbia. Oil spills are also a concern. A cruise ship the size of Crystal Serenity carries more than a million litres of fuel oil. In 2004, a much smaller cargo ship lost power in Alaska's Aleutian Islands, was blown aground and broke apart, spilling 1.2 million litres of fuel oil. Almost none of it was recovered because of the remote location, severe weather, and the near-complete absence of oil-spill cleanup equipment and personnel. Crystal Serenity is very professionally managed, which will minimize the risks. But the voyage will draw other cruise ships north, making a serious accident almost inevitable. No one expected, in 2012, that the Costa Concordia would run onto well-charted rocks along the coast of Italy. Just as problematically, Arctic cruises constitute a form of “extinction tourism,"" in which people travel to see a species or culture while they still can. Climate change is advancing quickly in the Arctic, threatening a food chain based upon plankton and Arctic cod that have evolved to live in cracks and crevices under the sea ice. As the ice disappears, so do these species and the predators they sustain, including beluga whales and polar bears. Worse yet, Arctic cruises create their own climate change “feedback loop."" These trips are only possible because the sea ice is melting, and their carbon-dioxide emissions contribute to even more melting in years to come. Consider the emissions associated with the Crystal Serenity: Passengers will fly from their homes to Anchorage, and return at journey's end from New York. On board the ship, they will enjoy food products that have also travelled great distances. They will be cared for by 655 crew members, each with their own smaller but still significant climate footprint. All the while, the ship will be burning fuel oil for propulsion, heat and electricity. The best argument in favour of Arctic cruises is that they raise awareness about climate change. Witnessing a beautiful ecosystem under threat can move some people to action, but I have also seen climate-change deniers double down on their beliefs when sailing newly open Arctic waters. The issue is not whether the sea ice is melting, but whether we accept the scientific process that has produced thousands of peerreviewed articles explaining the cause. The Arctic is beautiful and threatened by greenhouse gas emissions, but so are the birds and flowers in your local park. If you want a safe, climate-conscious vacation, try staying closer to home.

"N.L. incensed over Liberal budget; 'Get out if you can,' province's young are told",NL,"Newfoundland and Labrador had the world by the tail five years ago when former premier Danny Williams welcomed students attending a leadership conference to ""Canada's coolest province."" The treasury was flush with offshore oil money. New schools were under construction, roads were being paved, and chic restaurants catering to highflying executives with fat expense accounts were doing brisk business in St. John's. It was a taste of prosperity especially savoured in a province that had seen more than its share of hard times. It didn't last. ""Get out if you can"" was the bleak headline Monday over a St. John's Telegram column by Russell Wangersky. It laments the provincial budget delivered last week that projects a $1.8-billion deficit despite an array of new taxes, fees and the especially detested ""deficitreduction levy"" of up to $900 a year. ""Go,"" Wangersky urged young workers not tied down by mortgages. ""To my kids, to all kids: go. ""We voted in governments that promised, and delivered, on a quality of life we could not afford and that now must be curtailed. ""You shouldn't have to pay for our mistakes. Come and visit, for sure. But we made the mess. We should have to clean it up."" It's the new Liberal government's first spending plan since winning power last fall after 12 years of Progressive Conservative rule. It blames the former regime for overspending and mismanagement of unprecedented oil and mining profits over much of the Tory mandate, a spree that ended with the crash of commodity prices over the last two years. Still, the budget's gouging of at least $3,000 per typical family has made it a lightning rod for raw fury and a good dose of existential angst over the province's future. People are especially upset that there seems to be no light at the end of a dark tunnel - just an unemployment rate projected to hit 20 per cent by 2020, from about 13 per cent this year. Wangersky's words didn't go over well with all parents, however. Paddy Daly, host of callin radio show Open Line on VOCM, describes public reaction to the budget as: ""Savage. Absolutely savage."" Residents are incensed that the Liberals, who campaigned on protecting public-sector jobs and reversing a ""job killer"" harmonized sales tax hike, have aboutfaced with no clear recovery plan, he said. But Daly isn't yet willing to accept, let alone promote, a future that sees his two teenage boys leave for good. ""To be outwardly proposing people leave is to the detriment of all,"" he said. ""Doom and gloom is apparent. But when we foster it, then I think it becomes a dangerous road."" Jerry Earle has five children and is also president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees, representing 25,000 members. He said many of them are furious and fearful that sweeping job cuts will come with a fiscal update this fall. ""I've had two children that have had to leave,"" he said. A third just finished college and is applying for jobs outside the province. ""We will fight this tooth and nail,"" he said of the union's response to the budget, which has already included a series of ads highlighting broken Liberal promises. Matthew Stewart, an economist with the Conference Board of Canada, said the provincial government had few options. ""The deficit was completely unsustainable and they were trying to avoid major downgrades to their credit rating,"" he said. That said, less spending by cash-strapped consumers will likely hammer an already battered economy and spur out-migration, he added. Williams, whose faith in the province's future drove him to invest in the development of an industrial park and subdivision with potential for 5,000 homes on the outskirts of St. John's, declined through a spokesman to be interviewed. ""There have been three premiers and six years since Danny was in office - so he has no comment,"" said an emailed response."
‘We don't boom and we don't bust',NL,"When Saskatchewan native Joshua Simair set out to launch a food-delivery business in 2013, he didn't consider the bustling startup hubs of Toronto or Waterloo, Ont. The 29-year-old and his co-founders decided the best place in the country to grow their algorithm-powered network was Winnipeg. The city's low cost of living, deep talent pool and strong sense of community were a good fit for Skip the Dishes, which is built for mid-sized markets like Winnipeg itself and allows customers to order from dozens of restaurants and have their meals delivered by local drivers with an average delivery time of 45 minutes. Walking through his open-concept office filled with close to 300 employees in a trendy historic building three years later, Mr. Simair says he has no regrets about the location. “We're able to access a large network of people that are in my opinion as good as or better than in San Francisco or New York. It's basically talent arbitrage … fundamentally, this city is terrific."" Winnipeg, as anyone in the city will tell you with a rueful laugh, is best known by outsiders for its freezing winters and large mosquitoes. But it has also become known for something else – powering the engine of one of Canada's most stable, resilient provincial economies. As its Prairie neighbours, deeply dependent on oil, natural gas and potash, suffer from a commodities downturn, Manitoba's economy has found a golden mean, avoiding extremes bred from overreliance on a single natural resource. “We don't boom and we don't bust,"" Manitobans will say, pointing to a range of solid economic sectors: agriculture, health sciences, hydroelectric power, manufacturing, transportation, aerospace and financial services. That diversification helped Manitoba emerge from the Great Recession relatively unscathed – real GDP shrank only 0.2 per cent in 2009, compared with declines of 5.5 per cent in Alberta, 5.3 per cent in Saskatchewan and 3.1 per cent in Ontario. Today, almost two years into an oil shock that has swallowed thousands of jobs and sent resource-rich provinces Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland into a tailspin, Manitoba is a rare bright spot where the fruits of that diversification are paying off once again. The province is projected to have the third-highest rate of economic growth this year – 2.2 per cent according to RBC Economics Research, outpacing the national average of 1.7 per cent – and to enjoy the lowest unemployment rate in the country, 5.4 per cent, well below the Canadian norm of 7 per cent. In recent years, the city has lost head offices such as CanWest Global Communications and HudBay Minerals, but it still has financial stalwarts such as GreatWest Life and Investors Group, grain giant Richardson International, manufacturing operations for Boeing and maintenance and repair work for Standard Aero. And it has a small but growing technology sector, with roughly 50 startups such as Mr. Simair's, and a dedicated band of locals committed to fostering its growth. Without one dominant resource in the province, “we gotta grind,"" says Mike Pyle, CEO of Exchange Income Corp., a holding company with interests in aviation and manufacturing that has seen its share price increase by more than 150 per cent over the past 10 years. In 2014, the company sold a U.S. cellphone tower business that was rapidly increasing its revenues but sapping its resources. Mr. Pyle said Exchange Income returned to a more diversified portfolio of companies after the sale, drawing a comparison to the Manitoba economy. “The advantage of that is you don't get the other side when the pendulum swings against you. That's Manitoba's greatest advantage and we need to push growth from that level of stability."" But he cautioned that the Manitoba economy is being propped up to some extent by “a ton of deficit spending"" – the provincial deficit is projected to be $773-million for 2016, more than $350-million above initial forecasts – and argues the government should instead focus on reducing taxes and encouraging private sector growth. With a new business-friendly provincial government elected this month and a mayor keen on promoting the city across the country, there is a growing belief in Winnipeg that a high-growth sector could emerge to complement the city's existing strengths, drawing on that stable economy and the sense of community fostered in part by its relatively small size and isolated location. However, with a lack of venture capital in the province, many say there's a need for revised tax policies and new funding to support that growth and compete with other provinces. “We've got so many small to mid-sized businesses that need to reach that next level and that's what's missing. There's not those resources for them to go to,"" says Dayna Spiring, formerly the chief strategy officer of the Canadian Wheat Board who took over as CEO of Economic Development Winnipeg in March. Brian Pallister – the Progressive Conservative premier-designate poised to take over after more than 16 years of NDP rule – said during the campaign he would “make investment capital more accessible for Manitoba entrepreneurs."" How he will put that pledge into action remains unknown but Ms. Spiring is encouraged by his emphasis on economic development. “It's the first time that the stars have all aligned for Winnipeg to say, ‘Let's go do this.' "" ‘A tiger that needs to be unleashed' Marshall Ring, CEO of the Manitoba Technology Accelerator (MTA), says entrepreneurs in the city need examples of success and he hopes “graduates"" of his hands-on incubation program such as Skip the Dishes can play that role. “We have this problem of lack of history. That is the biggest balloon I'm trying to pop right now,"" he says. “What incents someone to say, ‘I can build a tech company here in Winnipeg and do well?' And where do they get investors?"" David Asper, a member of Winnipeg's old guard of business leaders, is among those taking a leading investing role in the city's burgeoning innovation economy. The lawyer, businessman and son of CanWest founder Izzy Asper is an active backer of Winnipeg tech startups – such as nuclear imaging firm Cubresa – through the Manitoba Knights, an angel investing group that works with Mr. Ring and the MTA. While he believes capital investment should be driven by private industry, Mr. Asper says the province can help by keeping tax and regulatory burdens low and competitive. “I actually think that the Manitoba economy is a tiger that needs to be unleashed and I'm waiting with keen interest to see how the government might be able to facilitate that."" Mr. Asper and other angel investors are helping to fill a gap left by the legacy of the Manitoba government's attempt to spur investment in small business through labour-sponsored funds. Created in 1992, the Crocus Investment Fund invested in small and medium-sized companies and its investors received provincial tax breaks. The fund's assets grew steadily from $2-million to a high of $174-million in 2003, but Crocus went into receivership in 2005 following management missteps and serious valuation concerns about many of the companies in its portfolio. Stuart Henrickson, executive director for entrepreneurship at the University of Manitoba's Asper School of Buinsess, moved back to Winnipeg in 2010 after a long career in corporate finance. “All I was hearing about was Crocus. It was a big black mark. Five years after Crocus, virtually nobody wanted to talk about investment funds."" Michael Legary incorporated cybersecurity firm Seccuris in 2000 and sold it last year to Japanese technology giant Hitachi Systems Ltd. for an undisclosed amount (after merging with Montreal firm Above Security). “The kinds of investments and risks taken were not well understood and left the negative repercussion of people not wanting to invest locally. Wanting a sure thing,"" Mr. Legary says. “We're getting over that and starting to see a change, because the interesting element now is that it's hip and cool to invest in startups."" ‘The magic of Winnipeg' A dearth of venture funding is not unique in Canada, but some suggest Winnipeg's size and sense of community are key strengths for the city. “It's big enough that you've got everything here and yet it's small enough that everybody knows each other and you can collaborate very, very easily, which is why there's a lot of success coming out of this place,"" says Paul Soubry, the CEO of New Flyer, the biggest bus manufacturer in North America. When the company was developing a new electric bus, he says it worked with Winnipeg Transit and Manitoba Hydro on the charging infrastructure and Red River College on training technicians. “To be able to pick up the phone and call the Premier or the key guys in the government or get the head of Manitoba Hydro or MTS [Manitoba Telecom Services Inc.] and get them together and so forth – that's part of what the magic of Winnipeg is,"" he says. Winnipeg and its surrounding rural municipalities account for almost 800,000 of the province's 1.3 million residents and the area is on track to reach a population of one million by 2035. The city is attracting about 10,000 newcomers a year, in part due to provincial policies designed to encourage immigration. Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman is trying to bolster the city's sense of community in the downtown core and has pledged to increase the number of downtown residents to 20,000 within his term, up from 15,000 when he took office. After being elected in late 2014, the 44-year-old faced an early controversy over the development of a parcel of downtown land. But the issue was ultimately resolved and in February, True North Sports and Entertainment (owner of the Jets and the MTS Centre they play in) announced a $400-million, four-tower office, residential, hotel and retail development. Mr. Bowman is also trying to spur employment in the Exchange District, a downtown area that covers about 20 city blocks and has been deemed a national historic site, named for the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Over the past five years, a vibrant startup community has coalesced in the area, which is home to a campus of Red River College as well as numerous restaurants and art galleries. Groups that used to operate in silos are increasingly co-operating, says Joelle Foster, director of Futurpreneur Canada in Manitoba, which provides seed loans to about 60 businesses a year. “Downtown Winnipeg has been going through this revitalization over the last decade,"" Mr. Legary says. “I think all the parts were there: Cheap space, the college was right there, and the Exchange District – just for food and fun, people like being there."" That growing startup scene is among the features Mr. Bowman is touting on a tour of Canadian cities, beginning with Montreal earlier this month, to talk up Winnipeg to investors and big corporations. He points to the completion of a new airport, the return of the Winnipeg Jets hockey team to a downtown arena, and tourist draws like a slick new polar bear exhibit at the Assiniboine Zoo, the Inuit Art Centre and the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, which adds a distinct architectural flavour to the skyline. The city is also home to several universities and colleges, including the University of Manitoba and Red River College. The low cost and ease of living in Winnipeg are also a draw, with average home prices in the range of $300,000 and short commute times from the surrounding suburbs to the downtown business district. Yet, the city is not an easy sell in every respect. Early in Mr. Bowman's tenure Maclean's magazine published a front-page headline arguing Canada's racism problem is the “ugliest in Winnipeg."" The mayor, who is Métis, convened an emotional press conference with aboriginal leaders and acknowledged the problem. A year later, he says, “the initial headline was a difficult one to see and rather than debate endlessly whether the headline was fair or not, we came together as a community to admit a difficult reality in all Canadian cities and that's the fact that racism does exist."" Mr. Bowman declared 2016 to be the “year of reconciliation"" and announced a number of commitments, including diversity training for city staff and the development of an urban aboriginal accord for Winnipeg. “There is this renewal and confidence that has been building in Winnipeg for a number of years and a renewed sense of pride and swagger that is only limited by our community's ambition."""
The best trail you've likely never heard of is on Canada's east coast,NL,"Yet, despite recognition by National Geographic as one of the world's best adventure destinations, Newfoundland's East Coast Trail remains virtually unknown to Americans.

Yet, despite recognition by National Geographic as one of the world's best adventure destinations, Newfoundland's East Coast Trail remains virtually unknown to Americans. The 165-mile trail connects 30 communities, from Cape St. Frances north of St. John's to Cappahayden on the southern shore, with plans to mark trails even further south. It follows the rocky coast, through villa`ges settled by Irish and West Country English, abandoned settlements, lighthouses, and historic sights. Though there's nothing overly technical about the trail, the topographic maps denote a constant tide of ups and downs. Just a year before, while we were still strangers, the trek was arranged as a collective experience after a writing conference in St. John's. We planned to hike the Avalon Peninsula 57 miles from Blackhead, outside St. John's, to just beyond La Manche Provincial Park. We left a food drop in Witless Bay, a midway stop where we would take a day off to watch puffins from a boat tour in the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve and sleep in a B&B.; We had no guide but a stack of East Coast Trail topographical maps and the advice of local Carolyn Cook, an avid hiker and trail runner who knew the route in all seasons. In our group were 11 women from the US, Canada, South Africa, and Somalia, ranging in age from our thirties to our fifties. Two were poets, the rest were writers with specialties as diverse as science fiction and travel. About a third of us were experienced hikers and backpackers. Most had been training for the adventure. For me the trip was a bit of a test. Though I am an experienced hiker, an injury had kept me from backpacking for several years. Could I carry 35 pounds for a week? Craving the feeling of being out on the trail, I did my physical therapy and went buoyed along on the enthusiasm of the others. The first step was walking to breakfast, shouldering my load past the rainbow houses of Jelly Bean row, through streets pitched steeply toward the container ships and oil rigs anchored in the harbor. St. John's wooden row houses and shady streets would not be out of place in New England, and certainly the craggy coves were a double take of Maine. But there was something wilder here. Captain James Cook, who would later earn fame circumnavigating the globe, honed his skills surveying Newfoundland's jigsaw coastline Newfoundland coast in the 1760s. A shuttle van dropped us off at Blackhead to avoid the highway heading out of the city. On the trail we found not another soul.

By midday we reached one of Newfoundland's main attractions.

There's a palpable spirit of promise in its reach. It's just 1952 miles across the north Atlantic to Ireland, which turns out to be closer than Montreal. The site served as a gun battery during WWII, with underground passages and bunkers defending one of the allied forces' essential ocean convoy routes. Now it was jammed with visitors streaming forth from a large parking lot. Despite the breakfast feast, we picnicked, eager to lighten our loads. My remaining cod cake tasted good, though I wished for a spot of hot sauce. Tour buses came and went and two members of our group decided to separate for an easier alternative. We became nine. The trail south offered some of the easiest walking of the trip, a narrow sloping path through tufted grass lit along the cliff tops. Clouds raced over us and the miles passed. In this perfect patch for daydreaming I hardly noticed the others dawdling, bent over on the trail. They had found something.

Though we made poor time to camp, the walk turned out to be one of the most satisfying stretches of the trip. So we were overconfident the following day when we arrived to the picturesque cove of Petty Harbor for lunch. We lingered over crisp fish and chips, took restroom bird baths and binged on Wi-Fi. Leaving town, our path took us up a steep residential street to a dead end facing a sheer forested bank. ""That's your trail,"" assured a homeowner from her deck, before we even asked. She had seen our kind before. Gaining the windswept barrens required scrambling at times. We hoped the hardest part was over. The heights sprawled before us, symphonic in scale and dotted with tiny inland ponds and solitary boulders perched above the grey Atlantic. While the terrain had evened out, it was far too exposed for camping. That meant that there was still far to go. So we pushed on to Motion Path, managing to startle an enormous bull moose grazing in a stream bed before descending Hartes Point ridge and its cascade of slick rock terraces that demanded solid footing on slanted rock.

Then, one wet morning my friend Wendy and I lost track of trail markers while deep in conversation. We considered doubling back but continued along a beach where we thought we saw a sign. But it was just a slightly stale offering on a flat rock: a paper plate holding a dozen hotdogs dressed in mustard. We photographed it to ensure it was not a mirage. It seemed to say that we were on the right track. We respected the fairies but left their offerings. Those stories about them never turned out well.

In Freshwater Bay, wild grasses and rosehips have reclaimed the stone foundations and garden walls of the former fishing village, a site used as early as the 1500's. It's one of many abandoned settlements along the Newfoundland coast. The East Coast Trail is also a story of changing economies. Though Newfoundlanders have always pegged their settlements to the coast, the trail was created two years after Newfoundland's fishing industry had tanked following the 1992 cod fishing moratorium. The idea came from a West Coast transplant who imagined a complement to Vancouver's popular West Coast Trail. Volunteers carved out the first 78 miles. Eventually, the provincial and federal government responded with most of the funding and the trail was formalized. Despite having little public support at first, thru-hiking offered a vision for a nascent industry.

Carrying an assortment of aches, we arrived to La Manche Provincial Park on our sixth day of walking. Over the past week we had overdosed on oatmeal, camped under saggy, soaked tents, and waded through mud bogs on an inland track to avoid the coast's wild headwinds. So we were euphoric to cross the 165-foot suspension bridge that heralded Herring Cove like a marathon finish line. We had made a final adjustment to our plans to end the trip here, enjoying a full day to explore the park before hiking out to the trailhead. It turned out to be the right call. Cupped between two waterfalls, lower La Manche pond makes a picture perfect swimming hole.

At sunset a family of five river otters swam under the bridge, fishing and cavorting under our noses. Though one of us had cut her bare foot at the swimming hole, we were otherwise ending on a high note. We had made it, with blood, sweat, and more laughter than tears. We camped amongst the slate foundations of the former settlement and discussed the highs, the lows, and the things we would do differently: share more gear, skip certain cardboard meals, and bring rum, as one wise woman had.

UNESCO draft decision again urges industrial buffer around Gros Morne park,NL,"GROS MORNE, N.L. _ Canada is once again urged to consider an industrial buffer zone for Gros Morne National Park in western Newfoundland, says a draft decision Friday by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. At stake is the park's world heritage status, granted in 1987 for its glacier-carved fjords, dramatic cliffs and geological features such as the Tablelands. The committee recommended a buffer zone in 2014 after an oil drilling and hydraulic fracturing proposal near Gros Morne set off intense public debate. ""It's an incredibly special place, and it's a place that Canada has promised to protect on behalf of the world community,'' said Alison Woodley, national parks director for the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society. ""When a world heritage site is designated, it means we are responsible for it on behalf of the world and we have to do everything we can to protect it. ""Canada has not acted. They're saying there's no need for a buffer zone.'' The committee will vote on the draft decision in July when it meets in Istanbul. If approved, Canada would be asked to report on conservation efforts by Dec. 1, 2017. Parks Canada, in a response to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre dated last Nov. 30, said there are already laws and rules to safeguard Gros Morne. ""Officials concluded that the current suite of legislation and regulations provides a sufficient and effective framework to ensure the protection of the site over the long term,'' it says. The province has not approved so-called fracking projects, and halted any applications while an independent panel _ set to report Tuesday _ reviewed potential impacts. The World Heritage Committee's draft decision raises concern that Gros Morne ""may no longer be adequately protected against oil and gas exploration if the (fracking) moratorium expires before other appropriate protection measures are in place.'' If that happens, it reiterates a previous request that a monitoring team be invited to assess risks to the park's ""outstanding universal value'' _ a key determinant of world heritage status. The Parks Canada response said such an invitation would be ""premature'' before the Newfoundland and Labrador Hydraulic Fracturing Review Panel reports. It said federal and provincial officials would discuss those findings. Requests for comment from federal and provincial ministers were not answered. The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board confirmed there is no activity off the province's west coast at this time. There are five exploration licences in the region but none adjacent to Gros Morne, it said. The park crowns the province's $1 billion-a-year tourism trade. It draws thousands of visitors each year from around the world, its famed beauty the star of several advertising campaigns. ""There's really strong support for a buffer zone here in the local community,'' Woodley said from Gros Morne. Thirty-two Canadian artists, writers and musicians including ""The Book of Negroes'' author Lawrence Hill and actor Greg Malone of ""Codco'' pushed last year for action. They signed an open letter asking Ottawa and the province to establish a buffer around the park to keep oil development and other industrial activity at a distance. Such protective zones are now standard practice around world heritage sites when they are nominated but that was not the case when Gros Morne was designated. _By Sue Bailey in St. John's, N.L.

Huge forest along Manitoba-Ontario border moves closer to UNESCO recognition,NL,"WINNIPEG _ A vast stretch of boreal forest along the Manitoba-Ontario boundary moved one step closer to international recognition Friday, as two UNESCO advisory bodies recommended Pimachiowin Aki be deemed a world heritage site. The federal, Manitoba and Ontario governments have put up millions of dollars over the past decade in the attempt to secure the designation for Pimachiowin Aki _ an Ojibwa phrase that translates as ""the land that gives life.'' The effort was dealt a setback in 2013, when the same UNESCO advisory groups said it was unclear whether the area _ a relatively untouched stretch of forest half the size of New Brunswick _ is unique. The governments submitted a reworked bid with more information about the ties between the area's indigenous inhabitants and the land, and the advisory groups have recommended the bid be given final approval at a meeting of the UNESCO world heritage committee in Turkey in July. ""The revised nomination provides much more detailed information on the cultural traditions of the Anishinaabeg, their symbiotic relationship with the landscape, and the tangible evidence of past and present interactions,'' one advisory group reports states. ""In spite of being subject to significant social disturbances as a result of European colonization, such as being placed on reserves and children being separated from their families by residential schooling, the Anishinaabeg have been able to retain their traditional culture.'' UNESCO recognizes more than 900 places around the world as world heritage sites _ everything from the Great Barrier Reef in Australia to Red Bay, a small former whaling community in Labrador. Former Manitoba premier Greg Selinger has said getting the designation for Pimachiowin Aki will boost tourism and make it easier to protect the boreal forest from over-development. UNESCO can withdraw heritage status from sites that undergo too much development, and has recently raised concerns about potential oil and gas drilling near Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland, which was granted world heritage status in 1987. Gord Jones, the Pimachiowin Aki project manager, said Friday a UNESCO designation would raise awareness about the importance of the boreal forest and the relationship between indigenous communities and the land. ""The recognition as a UNESCO site would provide even a higher level of recognition that this is a special place and it has been protected for the benefit of ... everyone around the world.''"

"Vancouver sees jobs boom, but young workers still can't afford housing",NL,"VANCOUVER _ Kala Vilches always knew she'd have to leave Vancouver if she wanted to buy a house. Three years ago, the fashion design graduate was working as a product developer at Lululemon, earning a good salary and living in what she calls ""the best Canadian city for fashion.'' But she was also paying $900 a month in rent, saving little and saddled with student debt. ""I was a salaried employee living in a tiny bachelor apartment with a view of a parking lot,'' she said. ""I kind of knew that I would have to, at some point, leave Vancouver if I wanted to own property. I just knew what the market was like. That was kind of always in my mind, even though I did end up getting, pretty quickly after I graduated university, a good job.'' Despite the fact that her industry was booming in Vancouver _ in addition to Lululemon, Arcteryx and Mountain Equipment Co-op have head offices in the city _ Vilches decided to move to Calgary. She got a job at FGL Sports in 2014 and has since paid off her student loans, bought a car and started building her RRSP. The 29-year-old's experience is familiar to many young professionals in British Columbia. The province, led by Metro Vancouver, topped the country in job creation last month, with year-over-year employment growth reaching a stunning 4.9 per cent compared to the national gain of 0.8 per cent, Statistics Canada says. Despite the jobs boom, many young workers getting hired still can't afford to live in the city, observers say. ""I'd love to move back to Vancouver because that's where my industry is biggest,'' said Vilches. ""But if I move back to Vancouver, I have to make sacrifices, and that would be not owning property, maybe ever. And that's a really big sacrifice for me because that's something that I want.'' Bryan Yu, a senior economist at Central 1 Credit Union, said the number of jobs in professional, scientific and technical services _ including fashion design _ grew about four per cent over the past year in B.C. Health care and social assistance grew 8.1 per cent, while information, culture and recreation, a category that includes Vancouver's growing technology sector, expanded 12.6 per cent. The strong housing market appears to be driving a 7.6 per cent gain in construction and a 16.1 per cent jump in business and building services, while a tourism boom and the low Canadian dollar seem to be pushing big gains in retail, wholesale trade, accommodations and food services, Yu said. ""There's really jobs being created across the board,'' he said. ""There are definitely gains occurring in the lower-paid sectors, but also we are seeing broad-based job gains across industries.'' B.C.'s unemployment rate fell to 5.8 per cent in April, down from 6.5 per cent in March and falling below all other provinces for the first time since 1976, Statistics Canada says. Part of the reason B.C. is doing so much better than the rest of Canada is because its economy isn't vulnerable to changes in the price of oil, Yu said. Plummeting oil prices have led to drastic job losses in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador. But Yu said the story outside B.C.'s south coast is very different. There has been little new investment in mining or natural gas, and last month, agriculture jobs dropped 11.9 per cent, while resource extraction dipped 6.2 per cent, he said. ""Vancouver is doing very well in terms of job growth, and to a lesser extent Victoria, but the rest of the province is still showing signs of job loss from a year ago,'' he said. Ken Peacock, chief economist and vice-president of the B.C. Business Council, said Metro Vancouver residents struggle with low or medium average incomes because the city has relatively few large corporate employers, which tend to pay higher wages. ""We do tend, in the Lower Mainland and Metro Vancouver, to struggle a little bit on the income front, and that is particularly true when you contrast it with housing prices,'' he said. But Peacock noted that even high-income earners are challenged by Metro Vancouver's housing market. The benchmark price for detached properties was $1.4 million in April, a 30-per-cent increase from the previous year, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver says. Keane Lim, a 29-year-old technical writer at a Richmond software company, said salaries haven't kept up with the cost of living in Metro Vancouver. It's possible that Vancouver is such an attractive place to live that employers don't feel they have to pay more, he said. ""People like to compare Vancouver to San Francisco, like, 'Oh, house prices are almost as bad as San Francisco,' but in San Francisco, you can make twice what you make here in U.S. dollars.'' He added that his parents immigrated to B.C. at a young age, studied, worked, saved money, bought a house and had a family. That's what he wants for his life, too, he said. ""You hear about millennials and how they think they're entitled to everything. I don't really think I'm entitled to a house, but it just seems impossible. It's not even realistic. Even if I doubled my salary or won the lottery overnight, maybe I could just barely afford something.'' _ Follow ?ellekane on Twitter."
Tourism a bright spot in bleak fiscal times for Newfoundland and Labrador,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ Tourism is always vital for Newfoundland and Labrador but never more so than this year as a financial crisis rocks the province. ""We have a lot riding on the summer,'' said Courtney Howell, who runs Grates Cove Studios and restaurant with her husband Terrence, a wood-worker and artist, on the northern tip of the Avalon Peninsula. It's their fourth season preparing a locally sourced menu billed as Newfoundland Cajun home cooking. They also pack picnic lunches for ocean-view walks along the Baccalieu Trail, and offer unique retreats in two vacation homes from which you just might glimpse an iceberg or humpback whales. Howell said bookings are slightly up this year. She's among many entrepreneurs hoping a good season will help buffer a provincial budget that has become a flashpoint for anger and worry. It contains sweeping tax and fee hikes but still projects a $1.8-billion deficit this year. The oil price crash since 2014 has drained the coffers of a government that heavily relied on profits from its offshore sector. ""You can tell people are very nervous,'' Howell said. ""It's going to make the difference to us,'' she added of her hopes for a strong summer. ""As much as people can support local (businesses), it makes a huge, huge impact.'' About a two-hour drive south in the capital St. John's, restaurant owners and other businesses must also absorb higher taxes imposed in the city's last budget. ""It's life or death this year for some people because of the city tax issues,'' said Nancy Brace, executive director of the Restaurant Association of Newfoundland and Labrador. ""They're hanging on by their fingernails.'' Chinched Bistro is located near the newly expanded St. John's Convention Centre. With a main ballroom that can hold just over 1,500 people, the centre could be a much needed economic boost, said bistro co-owner Michelle LeBlanc. ""We have to think positive, be creative and work together,'' she said of downtown businesses. George Murphy, a night dispatcher and driver for Jiffy Cabs in St. John's, said the exodus of big-spending oil executives over the last year was a major blow even before the provincial budget came down. Many drivers don't know if they can last another six months, he said. ""We have this discussion at quiet times, at three o'clock in the morning, directly on the radio.'' Residents are noticeably belt-tightening, Murphy said. He wonders if tourists will be put off by a Harmonized Sales Tax going up to 15 per cent from 13 per cent on July 1. That's on top of a 16.5 cents per litre gas tax increase _ double the current rate _ as of June 2, adding about $8 to fill a mid-sized vehicle. Tourism Minister Christopher Mitchelmore downplayed the latter concern, saying prices at the pumps were higher last year. He expects gasoline rates will be comparable even with the higher tax factored in. Tourism, worth $1 billion a year to the province, is a bright light of hope and opportunity, he said in an interview. ""I was on the Northern Peninsula, the west coast (of Newfoundland), the Bonavista Peninsula, and all indications are for a very strong tourism season. Bookings are higher than last year, and we're also seeing new product being developed.'' Mitchelmore said the latest in the province's series of colourful, award-winning tourism ads _ ""Crayons'' _ has been a hit, featuring the charm of outport villages and vibrant jellybean rowhouses in St. John's. There are now two direct flights connecting St. John's with London and one with Dublin to attract European visitors, he added. UNESCO world heritage sites including Gros Morne National Park, the Viking encampment at L'Anse aux Meadows on the Northern Peninsula, and the Red Bay Basque Whaling Station in Labrador are also major draws, Mitchelmore said. ""Newfoundland and Labrador offers pristine beauty. It allows people to get away from their concrete jungles and truly experience our local culture.'' Like never before, the province is counting on it. If You Go...

"Too many science, technology gaps to recommend fracking in Newfoundland: report",NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ There are too many science, technology and risk-assessment gaps to green-light fracking in western Newfoundland, says a panel that studied the contentious oil-extraction process. In a report released Tuesday, it recommends the province continue its freeze on fracking applications until major questions are answered. ""The science, the studies that have been done, have been somewhat limited _ certainly limited compared to what we'd expect to have done in order to plan this kind of operation,'' said Ray Gosine, an engineering professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland who led the government-appointed panel. ""There are a number of gaps and deficiencies that are significant,'' he said in an interview. ""These must be addressed before we feel that conditions could reasonably exist that would allow hydraulic fracturing operations to proceed responsibly.'' Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady said in a statement that the province is studying the findings. ""In the meantime, the current policy to not accept applications for hydraulic fracturing will not be changing. Any future decisions regarding the hydraulic fracturing industry will be based on scientific evidence, and most importantly, on a social license from the Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who may be affected.'' It's believed Newfoundland's west coast has deep shale formations that hold oil, unlike more shallow coal bed gas deposits in parts of the U.S. and western Canada. The province has not approved hydraulic fracturing _ or fracking _ for oil and gas by pumping water, nitrogen, sand and chemical additives at high pressure to split shale rock formations. It's a process supporters say has been safely used for decades. Critics blame fracking for groundwater contamination, air pollution and increased earthquakes. Newfoundland and Labrador blocked any related applications in 2013, pending a review, after a proposal to frack for oil near Gros Morne National Park touched off intense public debate. ""There are concerns that industrial activity around Gros Morne National Park could threaten its designation as a UNESCO world heritage site or could negatively impact the enclave communities around the park that have developed a tourism industry based largely on Gros Morne,'' says the panel's report. ""An appropriate buffer zone around Gros Morne National Park must be established.'' Steps that should be taken before fracking is allowed should also include assessing potential health effects, greenhouse gas emissions and a modern seismic study of the Green Point Shale south of Gros Morne, says the report. On Friday, Canada was once again urged in a draft decision by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee to act on its 2014 call for a buffer zone around the park's famous cliffs, fjords and hiking trails. Simon Jansen of the Newfoundland and Labrador Fracking Awareness Network said there are better, renewable energy options. ""It confirms all the uncertainties that we have been pointing out,'' he said of the review panel. ""So many people have created a living around sustainable tourism. Even if fracking can be done in whatever shape or form, is this a good fit for the existing lifestyle with respect to fisheries and tourism?'' The report offers a graduated series of several other recommendations when and if the province lifts its current ""pause'' on fracking. They include studying how wastewater would be handled, and the extent of existing rural fire and emergency services. ""Risks must be identified, assessed and effectively managed,'' it says. ""The public must have confidence that an industry will be managed and regulated in a manner that protects the health of people and the environment, and that advances the interests of the communities most affected by development.'' Paul Barnes, Atlantic Canada manager for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said the report offers a balanced way forward. ""It represents a prudent approach to shale development on the west coast here based on responsible, fact-based information.'' Barnes believes there's economic potential for fracking _ if public confidence is bolstered with those answers. The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board says there's no activity off the province's west coast at this time. There are five exploration licences in western Newfoundland, but none adjacent to Gros Morne. The panel offered a hypothetical ""illustrative scenario'' of hydraulic fracturing for the Green Point Shale, including 480 production wells to be drilled over six years from about 35 onshore well pads near the coast around Port au Port Bay. It concluded truck traffic would soar and that such a project to produce oil for export wouldn't be fiscally attractive for the province below a price of about US$85 a barrel. Moreover, estimated yearly revenues of $84 million to $136 million would not ""be a 'game-changer' with respect to the fiscal position of Newfoundland and Labrador,'' says the report. Brent crude prices have crashed since 2014, recently trading at just under US$50 a barrel. New Brunswick announced last week it has no plans to lift its moratorium on hydraulic fracturing. A related commission report last February recommended several conditions _ including a single independent regulator _ to allow a shale gas industry to grow in the province.

What's making news in Atlantic Canada,NL,"CABINET SHUFFLE GIVES N.B. FIRST FEMALE FINANCE MINISTER New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant has named the province's first female finance minister in a cabinet shuffle that's added two more members. Cathy Rogers has been moved to the finance ministry from social development and is also the minister responsible for literacy. Gallant has also boosted the number of women in his new 14-member cabinet to three with the addition of Lisa Harris -- who becomes minister of Seniors and Long-Term Care, and minister responsible for Celtic Affairs. John Ames is also new to cabinet, becoming minister of Tourism, Heritage and Culture. PROJECT SPENDING TO DROP, THINK TANK PREDICTS An economic think tank predicts investment in major projects will drop by two per cent to $12.8 billion in Atlantic Canada this year due to a slowdown in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Atlantic Provinces Economic Council says spending will increase by 19 per cent in Nova Scotia over last year -- mainly due to work on construction of the arctic offshore patrol ships at the Halifax Shipyard and increased offshore oil and gas exploration. Increases are also forecast for Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, in part due to electricity projects. But the council says Newfoundland and Labrador is being hit by declining activity on offshore oil projects and the winding down of the construction phase of the Hebron offshore oil development. CROWN SEEKS PEACE BOND AGAINST DALHOUSIE MED STUDENT Three of four charges have been dropped in the case of a Dalhousie University medical student who allegedly told his psychiatrist he had thoughts of shooting up to 20 people before killing himself.

"Playing the piper; In an exclusive interview, arthur irving, the spotlight-shy head of irving oil, makes the case for energy east - a project he believes isn't just good for his company, but is important for all of canada",NL,"New Brunswick is an unlikely place to build an oil refining and marketing powerhouse, but Arthur Irving has managed to do just that by earning the respect of his customers, hiring loyal employees and shrewdly using his family's power to get what he and his company needed, all the while managing to stay out of the media spotlight. But his latest and perhaps grandest plan yet, the proposed Energy East pipeline, may have more hurdles than even Irving can handle. To see it succeed, he's prepared to change his tactics. ""We have to make the right moves to stay in the game,"" the 85-yearold patriarch of the Irving dynasty's oil branch said in a rare and exclusive interview, his confident voice filling the wood-panelled boardroom of Irving Oil's modest Saint John, N.B., headquarters, once a garage where his dad, K.C. Irving, used to paint Fords. Irving Oil Ltd. has partnered with Calgary-based TransCanada Corp. on the proposed $15.7-billion Energy East project. It would give Irving Oil - which has grown from a single service station that opened in 1924 in the coastal town of Bouctouche - a national presence and a big role in the export of Western Canadian crude from the East Coast. But pipelines are not in public favour and the opposition to Energy East has been building as the National Energy Board grinds ahead with its regulatory review of the 1.1-million-barrels-a-day project. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is staying on the sidelines for now, Quebec and Ontario have built political roadblocks, and environmentalists just want it gone. And so after a lifetime of shunning the spotlight, Irving Oil and its chairman are stepping up to publicly make the case for why the country needs Energy East, and why Irving Oil is well positioned to help bring the project to fruition. ""Nothing would please us more than to get Alberta oil in bigger quantities than we are getting now,"" Irving said. ""And there isn't a day that we don't think about that pipeline coming to Saint John, because guess what? It's got to come. Alberta needs it, Ottawa needs it, New Brunswick is all behind it, and Canada should be supporting it until we get it."" For Irving Oil, the idea of Energy East surfaced around 2011, when one of its teams happened to be in Calgary to work on a plan to bring large quantities of oil to Saint John by rail. The group discussed with TransCanada other opportunities to work together. TransCanada was just beginning to float the idea of Energy East and Arthur Irving quickly got behind it. He felt a pipeline was more sensible and much safer than hauling oil by train. But he believed TransCanada's original vision, which saw the pipeline end in Quebec, fell short of its potential. Irving, one of Canada's wealthiest people, argued with the Calgary-based company, a long-time partner since building a power plant inside his refinery, that using the smaller ships necessary on the St. Lawrence River would mean higher freight rates. By pushing the pipeline all the way to Saint John, Energy East would benefit by getting access to the Bay of Fundy, where the world's largest ships could come and cheaply haul western Canadian crude to markets far and wide. It would also benefit from Irving's long history of safely moving tankers in and out of the Bay of Fundy, which has the world's highest tides. Irving's refinery, meanwhile, would also process some of the Alberta crude to increase its value. ""We will go 50-50"" on the terminal, Irving suggested to TransCanada. ""We will build the dock, we will run the dock. We have a lot of experience - since 1970 we have been bringing ships to the Bay of Fundy with crude,"" he said. ""You own the pipeline and you own the tank farm."" Eventually, with some hand-holding by Frank Mc-Kenna, the former New Brunswick premier and one-time Canadian ambassador to the U.S., the companies clinched a deal in 2013. Irving Oil agreed to ship 50,000 barrels a day for 20 years and would partner with TransCanada to build its terminal near Saint John and then operate it. Energy East was officially announced on Aug. 6, 2013. At that point, a second terminal at Cacouna, Que., was proposed. Western producers were concerned about depending entirely on a single export point, and being beholden to the powerful Irving family. But that terminal was shelved due to opposition in Quebec over the potential impact of tankers on beluga whales in the St. Lawrence. In the project's final appl ication, submitted by TransCanada to the National Energy Board this past May, Energy East connects to two refineries in Quebec and the Irving facility, but ultimately flows into a single terminal at the Canaport Irving Oil site near Saint John, giving Irving Oil a big piece of one of the largest energy projects on the continent. Alex Pourbaix, TransCanada's chief operating officer, said Irving drove a hard bargain, and TransCanada would have pursued its own terminal in Saint John if a deal with Irving couldn't be made, but negotiations were always respectful since the two companies had a long existing relationship and they had a common goal. ""They have a very longterm experience in processing, transporting, shipping oil in and around that port, and having them as a partner gives TransCanada a great deal of credibility in the community,"" he said. The proposed 4,600-kilometre line involves converting a gas line from Alberta to Quebec and building a new one through New Brunswick. In addition to providing an export outlet, the project aims to replace the 550,000 to 600,000 barrels of offshore oil used daily by Eastern Canada's refiners with Western Canadian oil. Irving could envision the full potential of linking Alberta's oilfields to New Brunswick's coast because he knew Western Canada's oilpatch - and its challenges with exporting to the U.S. and to Canada's West Coast - better than it knew Irving Oil, one side of a family-owned empire that dominates New Brunswick's economy. (The other major branch is run by Arthur's older brother, J.K. Irving, and specializes in forestry, shipbuilding and potato processing.) Indeed, Irving Oil has generally operated in its own orbit. Its business spans Eastern Canada and is also well established in New England. The western Canadian oilpatch, meanwhile, is generally linked toward the south by pipelines to the U.S. Midwest and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Yet Arthur Irving is by many measures Canada's most successful oilman. Bloomberg estimates his personal wealth at more than US$6 billion. The estimate is likely conservative, but is still larger than the individual oil fortunes built in the West where competition abounds. His brother's fortune is estimated at US$5.3 billion. Although Irving has agreed to talk about Energy East, he still doesn't want to talk about his family's fortunes. ""We are not interested in showing off what we have or we don't have,"" he said. ""We just do what we have to do and it's been a lot of fun and it still is."" T he Irving Oil name is ubiquitous in New Brunswick. It blares on gas stations, buildings, uniforms and oil tanks, ships and trucks. The company employs more than 3,000 fiercely loyal direct employees and thousands more at its partners and suppliers depend on it. Many employees are lifers who embrace Irving's values, including giving back to the community. Irving's many causes include health care, education and even preserving historic landmarks, such as the Loyalist graveyard next to its headquarters. ""We have always, always made sure that our gasoline, our jet fuel, our heating oil, our diesel fuel, our marine gasoil, our asphalt, our quality will be right,"" Arthur Irving said. ""We'll be price competitive, and we'll deliver on time, and if we owe you any money, we will pay you on time - and earn respect. ""And if we tell anybody we will do something, it's guaranteed that we'll do it. If it takes our shirt, it will take our shirt. The aim is that we never let up on doing what we do and everybody who works for the company has that same mandate."" That relentless drive has also given the Irving companies unrivalled clout in New Brunswick, a fact that tends to discourage new entrants, said William Parenteau, a University of New Brunswick professor who specializes in environmental history and the political economy of the Atlantic region. ""In terms of major industry, there is not much left other than the Irvings,"" Parenteau said, adding it's hard to gauge their full economic impact because the family's businesses -perhaps as many as 250 different companies - are closely held and don't disclose financial information. Although much of the family's operations are based in New Brunswick, Irving Oil has looked at growth based on Alberta oil before. In Jacques Poitras' book, Irving vs. Irving, chronicles the family's conflicts over the splitting of the fortune of founder K.C. Irving, Arthur and J.K.'s father, which resulted in the oil company being separated from the conglomerate in 2008. He points out that the Irvings were invited by Ottawa in 1958 to import Alberta oil. At the time, they were not interested because they could import cheaper oil from the Middle East. What's changed since then is that Energy East would allow Irving Oil to tap western oil that is now heavily discounted. But the company now recognizes there is lack of awareness about its business and its safety record outside Eastern Canada, and that's not helping to get the public onside with Energy East. The company has ""literally courted people to come down"" said Mark Sherman, Irving Oil's chief operating officer, and a former executive in the Syncrude oilsands project in Alberta. ""No one was really aware of the facility and the situation here,"" he said. ""People can hear that we might be the largest refinery in Canada, but they didn't really appreciate the quality of the facility and the quality of the people in the organization."" Leading western Canadian oilmen - including TransCanada's entire board - have visited Irving Oil's facilities, an employee newsletter has been launched, and president Ian Whitcomb, a former Deloitte LLP partner and longtime member of Irving's inner circle, last month spoke about the company at the annual investment symposium of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Whitcomb took over as president last year, succeeding a couple of outsiders who left abruptly -Mike Ashar and Paul Browning - as well as Arthur Irving's oldest son, Kenneth, who ran Irving Oil for a decade before leaving, also abruptly, in 2010 over a disagreement on his inheritance. Arthur Irving, however, remains in charge of major strategic decisions and goes to the office regularly. It's unknown how much of the company he owns. Irving Oil's core business is still the 320,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Saint John. It sits like a steel fortress on high ground outside Saint John and is announced by a row of whitewashed oil tanks, each one shouting the Irving name in giant letters. From locker rooms to of- fices and grounds to roads, the facility is spotless. Office workers have refused to trade their collared shirts and ties for the casual clothing that has cropped up in many other organizations, arguing that looking professional inspires confidence. ""We are a hometown company and we want to put the best foot forward every day,"" said general manager Dale Cooper. The refinery started as a modest 40,000-barrels-aday operation in 1960. The first big expansion was in the 1970s and that took it to 180,000 barrels a day. The next growth spurt was to 265,000 barrels a day in 1998 to 2000. Its current size was achieved through debottlenecking - or making the facility more productive - over the past 10 to 15 years. Plans to build a second, $7-billion refinery nearby in partnership with BP PLC to double capacity were scrapped in 2009, a casualty of the global financial crisis and worries about the weakening demand for gasoline. Irving Oil feeds the refinery with crude imported by tanker from offshore Newfoundland, the North Sea, and as far away as Venezuela, West Africa and Saudi Arabia. Irving has had a close relationship with the latter since the refinery's early days, and it wants that to continue even if Energy East moves forward. Rail shipments from the West started in 2011 but have since fallen off, squeezed by high transportation costs - $15 to $18 a barrel - and low oil prices. ""The advantage of being a coastal refinery and having full access to waterborne crude is we are able to pursue the most economically advantaged crudes for us,"" Cooper said. ""So, as prices have changed, we have moved back to some of the most traditional sources ... to displace barrels coming out of Gulf Coast or Western Canada."" Irving Oil can already process 50,000 barrels a day of heavy crude from Western Canada, but its upgrading capacity could be increased if Energy East becomes a reality. Jeff Matthews, chief business development officer, said heavy oil processing could be boosted by adding coking capacity rather than building a standalone upgrader, but there are no firm plans for now. ""It's a big investment and we will have to really think about that at some point,"" he said. ""When (Energy East) becomes more of a certain thing, we will put some effort into working with some of the shippers on the pipeline and some of the companies with Western Canada to see if there are more opportunities."" M ore than 100 of the world's largest ships, with capacities ranging from 500,000 to two million barrels of oil, moor every year in the deep waters a stone's throw away from Irving Oil's Canaport Terminal. They attach to a floating buoy and pump crude into a hose that aims for another row of white tanks bearing the Irving name. Many oil companies describe refining as a tough and volatile business. But Irving Oil's chief operating officer, Mark Sherman, said the company has made it profitable by buying crudes from all over the world, investing continuously to stay competitive, operating a large refinery that gives it economies of scale, and being next to New England, a market of 100 million people where it places 80 per cent of its product. It helps that as a private company, Irving Oil has lower profit expectations and a longer time horizon than its publicly traded competitors. ""We are only 60 miles from the U.S. border,"" Irving said. ""It's a huge market in the U.S., New England, and we are close by, and we run a lot of cars in Boston."" The refinery accounts for 75 per cent of Canada's gasoline exports to the U.S. and 19 per cent of all U.S. gasoline imports. But running a safe operation is just as important to Irving, a proud New Brunswicker who has resisted moving to bigger centres because of his roots in the city and his love for its busy waterways and gentle countryside. ""My dad would always say, and people would say, 'Why do you hang out here, Mr. Irving?' "" he said. ""But my grandfather never left, my father never left, and we are not moving. This is headquarters, this is home, and we have thousands of people working for Irving, and we are happy to be able to do it."" Safety is the reason Irving insisted on being in charge of Energy East's proposed terminal and its marine operations. The terminal would be located on vacant forested land near Canaport, which already houses a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in partnership with Spain's Repsol SA that is underutilized because of poor market conditions for LNG imports and exports. The company said its safety record so far is unblemished. ""We never had any oil spill in the Bay of Fundy or major incident around importing oil,"" Sherman said, despite bringing in more than 100 oil tankers and more than 400 products ships a year. ""It's why in our partnership with TransCanada we feel we are the best to manage the marine end of that business, because that is what we do."" Irving Oil's confidence comes from the region's centuries of experience. Saint John has been a shipbuilding port since the 1700s. Although the tides in the Bay of Fundy are the largest in the world, they are plied with precision by the six Irving Oil-branded ships that take refined products to customers in Boston, across the Maritimes and Quebec. Some sail as far as Florida or Hawaii. They take turns loading 265,000 barrels each of oil products from two docks at the company's East Saint John terminal. The operation is completed within 12 hours, so the ships come in and go out in a single tide. ""The marine aspect is critical to our business, because this area of Canada and the U.S. doesn't have a pipeline infrastructure,"" said Michael Thompson, director of logistics and distribution, aboard the Acadian, as the ship filled its belly with diesel and gasoline. With the refinery running around the clock, and 90 per cent of its output reaching markets by vessel, Irving Oil's processes, people and infrastructure work closely together to keep product moving and clients satisfied, he said. But it's the retail business that is closest to Irving's heart. That's where the company started, and that's what's keeping Irving Oil an unusually customer-focused oil company. Irving is known to drop into service stations to do his own quality control, such as visiting bathrooms to ensure they're clean. He notes proudly that his father opened the first female washroom in a gasoline station in Atlantic Canada. ""Everybody needs respect, and so that was one way to try to show it,"" he said. The flagship of Irving Oil's retail business is a Big Stop near the town of Salisbury. It's a giant complex abutting the TransCanada highway, where truck drivers are pampered like luxury hotel guests. The company owns 20 of these facilities, part of a chain of 900 service stations (some wholly owned, some branded Irving Oil and owned by independent distributors). Big Stops are so popular that they are tourist destinations. They feature family restaurants, driver lounges with spotless showers and hotelquality white towels, convenience stores and, of course, filling stations and parking. At the Salisbury location, the restaurant, run by Paul Lavoie and his son Steve, even gets a surge in patrons after church on Sundays. Darren Gillis, Irving Oil's general manager of sales and marketing operations, said the company has invested in its retail business to keep up with customer demand, and growth is continuing. ""When the industry moved from service bays to convenience stores because automobiles were more reliable, Irving Oil had to reinvent itself and focus on convenience stores,"" he said. ""When the trucking industry exploded in the '60s and '70s, we had to reinvent ourselves again and focus on the drivers who were long-haul and professional drivers."" Irving Oil's competitive advantage in gasoline retailing, Gillis said, is ""the wow factor."" It's that eagerness to please and accommodate that Irving Oil needs to win over a public conflicted about pipelines such as Energy East. Premier Brian Gallant has championed the project and the province has been lobbying for a role in the NEB's review. The New Brunswick business community, of course, is also already onside. A survey recently conducted by the Saint John Region Chamber found 97 per cent are in favour of the plan. The marine terminal alone would cost $400 million to build, resulting in construction and other related jobs, and the arrival of so much western Canadian oil could mean game-changing opportunities for the area, said David Duplisea, the chamber's chief executive. New Brunswick, which loses thousands of people a year to jobs Western Canada, could use the economic boost since its unemployment rate is hovering around 10 per cent, he said. ""That is a tremendous brain drain, worker drain,"" Duplisea said. ""A lot of young people have moved out West."" But opposition to the project is mounting, much like it did to defeat oil pipelines in Western Canada and in the U.S. as regulatory hearings progressed. The Conservation Council of New Brunswick, the main local environmental organization, argues Energy East would increase the risk of oil spills, harm whales and the local fishery, and discourage tourism. The group has partnered with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the New York-based group that led the successful campaign against TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline, to bolster the fight. ""Certainly in New Brunswick, (there) is a long story of the various Irving corporations getting their way, sometimes despite overwhelming public opposition,"" said Matthew Abbott, marine program co-ordinator at the council. The pipeline, he added, ""is designed to gain access to global markets for western oil and I understand the motivation for that, and locally a lot of the motivation and excitement around it is around jobs, but my contention is the jobs put at risk aren't being factored in."" The Council of Canadians, an environmental activist group based in Ottawa, has also held town halls in May where it attacked TransCanada's safety record. Irving is aware the project is controversial and said his company could survive without it. But, despite his advanced age, he's determined to see it through, perhaps as the last, grandest gesture of an extraordinary life. ""There is always opposition to a lot of good things,"" he said. ""But the right thing to do is to do the right thing."" Financial Post ccattaneo@nationalpost.com"
"Oil patch investment decline not over yet, Poloz says; The recent recovery in the price of crude is stalling, said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz in a speech in Whitehorse on Wednesday",NL,"OTTAWA -- The recent bounce-back in the price of oil isn’t likely to stop investment from continuing to fall in Canada’s battered energy sector, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz says. That’s because the recent recovery in the price of crude, which has risen to near $50 (U.S.) a barrel from less than $30 earlier this year, is stalling, Mr. Poloz said in a speech Wednesday in Whitehorse, Yukon. “An extended period of oil prices at recent levels is unlikely to lead to greater investment spending in the Canadian oil patch,” he added. “Indeed, market intelligence suggests there is further downside risk to investment at these still-low prices.” He said oil prices, which reached more than $100 a barrel in 2014, won’t regain those lofty heights in “the foreseeable future.” Oil and gas producers have already cancelled or delayed several major oil sands projects, curtailed drilling and laid off thousands of workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland. That has hammered business investment in Canada. In the energy sector alone, investment this year is expected to be 60 per cent below 2014 levels – representing billions of dollars worth of lost economic activity. U.S. shale-oil producers are successfully cutting costs, allowing them to bring supply back on stream profitably. Mr. Poloz said this boost in oil supplies will keep a lid on further price gains. On the positive side, the Bank of Canada now estimates that the economic fallout from the massive Fort McMurray fire could be slightly less severe than it initially thought. The central bank says the blaze will knock one to 1.25 percentage points off gross domestic product – the broadest measure of the economy – in the second quarter. It previously estimated the hit would be 1.25 percentage points. This lost output is expected to be made up between July and September, he said. The net result is that Canada’s economy will be flat or shrink in the second quarter and “show an outsized recovery” in the third quarter, according to Mr. Poloz. The economy is likely to be “very choppy” through to the end of the summer, he said. The U.S. Federal Reserve opted again Wednesday to delay planned interest rate hikes. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen cited the looming British vote on leaving the European Union and a recent slowdown in U.S. job creation for holding off. Most economists don’t expect the Bank of Canada to start raising its key rate until late next year. Longer term, Mr. Poloz insisted he’s optimistic that Canada’s economy is on the right track. There is continuing evidence that exports outside the energy sector are coming back, buoyed mainly by the gradually strengthening U.S. economy, he said. “Many firms are close to their capacity limits, which augurs well for future investment and new job creation,” he said. “So while the whole process has been disappointingly slow and uneven, we remain confident that we have the right narrative.” He noted in particular that exports of building materials, furniture and fixtures, as well as pharmaceuticals, are all up strongly and have regained pre-recession levels. Tourist spending in Canada is also way up as more Americans take advantage of the cheaper Canadian dollar and fewer Canadians head south. Mr. Poloz acknowledged that the recovery from the resource price shock continues to be bumpy. “The process has been uneven, and probably will remain so, but we are making real progress,” he said.

"Small business ‘reeling' from tax, fee hikes",NL,"It's a fact that hangs over St. John's chef and restaurateur Michelle LeBlanc every time she goes to work. Dining out is a luxury, not a necessity. “The sad reality is people don't need to go out to dinner,"" said Ms. LeBlanc, who along with husband Shaun Hussey, own and operate Chinched Bistro in the city's downtown core. These days, that's truer than ever in Newfoundland and Labrador. Downturns in the oil and gas and mining sectors have hit the province's economy hard. Its financial situation is also a mess. In April, the provincial government announced a $1.83-billion deficit and plans to introduce tax and fee hikes it projects will give it $647-million in revenue. It's predicting the province won't be in the black until 2022. Dwindling royalties from offshore oil production is a big reason the Liberal government introduced these measures. The province raked in a record $2.8billion in offshore oil royalties during the 2011-12 fiscal year, but expects to collect a mere $572million in 2015-16. It's also blaming the previous Progressive Conservative government for providing tax reductions during the boom times that it says weren't sustainable. The tax increases and fee hikes are numerous. Income taxes are going up. The HST will go from 13 per cent to 15 per cent on July 1. The general corporate income tax rate has been increased from 14 per cent to 15 per cent, retroactive to Jan. 1. The gas tax has been temporarily increased to 16.5 cents a litre. The Liberals have also introduced a “temporary deficit reduction levy."" The levy will cost each resident making at least $25,000 between $300 to $900 annually, depending on how much they earn. This is not a business climate that breeds optimism, especially for entrepreneurs such as Ms. LeBlanc, who run small businesses that depend on people having enough disposable income to splurge on things like fine dining. “Yeah, it's good times right now. It's fun,"" Ms. LeBlanc said jokingly. Businesses across the province might have to get used to leaner times. The Conference Board of Canada is forecasting Newfoundland and Labrador's economy will only expand by 0.2 per cent this year and that it will be the only province facing a recession in 2017. The Atlantic Provinces Economic Council says the weak economic growth is because of slower spending in offshore oil development projects and weak provincial capital spending and housing activity. The council's president and chief executive, Finn Poschmann, says small and mediumsized businesses in the province have been facing trouble for mroe than a year now because of the energy-commodity downturn. The tax and fee increases only make matters worse. “The real impact will come through depressed consumer discretionary spending, owing to the tax and fee increases,"" Mr. Poschmann said. “The impact will be broad-based, but will be a drag on growth."" Vaughn Hammond is the director of provincial affairs for the Newfoundland and Labrador branch of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. He says the 2,000 members his organization represents in the province are worried about their future in the wake of April's budget. “They're optimistic on the outside, but kind of reeling on the inside,"" Mr. Hammond said. Mr. Hammond believes the tough economic climate is forcing small businesses to cut costs to improve their bottom line. He notes some businesses have turned to compressed work weeks and are asking employees to work four days instead of five. Layoffs have been inevitable in some cases. “For some of our members, this is the first time in years, or the first time ever, they've had to lay off staff,"" Mr. Hammond said. At Chinched Bistro, Ms. LeBlanc is looking for ways to adjust to an economy that is no longer booming. That means looking at less expensive cuts of meat and brands of wine to buy for her restaurant. It also means Ms. LeBlanc and Mr. Hussey must do the work of more than two people at times. “You have to pay attention to every dollar you spend,"" Ms. LeBlanc said. However, it's not all doom and gloom for small businesses in Newfoundland and Labrador. The unemployment rate is 11.7 per cent, down from its five-year high of 14.4 per cent in December. And the summer tourism season has arrived. Ms. LeBlanc says it's shaping up to be a “spectacular one"" that will keep St. John's restaurants busy and might make up for the slow winter and spring they experienced. She's also mindful that small business owners in the province are used to hard economic times. They know how to survive downturns. “We need to be determined and optimistic to continue the success of our business,"" Ms. LeBlanc said. “We've just got to power through this."""
Chop Suey Nation,NL,"From Victoria to Fogo Island and every province in between: Ann Hui drives across the country to uncover the immigrant origins – and vibrant present – of small-town Chinese-Canadian food PART ONE OF TWO: Victoria to the Prairies A bout an hour-long ferry ride off the northeast coast of Newfoundland, where the frigid waters of the Atlantic Ocean crash onto a jutting granite shoreline, is the tiny island of Fogo – a place so remote that conspiracy theorists believe it to be one of the four corners of the Earth. And in a small village on this island – where wooden houses and clapboard sheds dot the shore like Monopoly pieces – is Kwang Tung Restaurant, Fogo Island's very own Chinese café. I first learned of Kwang Tung after stumbling across it in a food blog post titled “I can't believe there's a Chinese restaurant in Fogo."" Like the author, I was bewildered. How did the restaurant wind up there? Why would someone decide to open a Chinese restaurant on Fogo Island? The post included a photo of a plate of food: a deep-fried egg roll, its blistered surface laid atop brown fried rice. There was also a photo of the Kwang Tung menu, an inventory of Chinese-Canadian classics: sweet and sour won tons, moo goo guy pan and a long list of dishes dredged in batter, deep-fried and coated in sweet, sticky, vaguely spicy sauces. “Chinese Canadian food,"" the writer proclaimed. “Good in that guilty pleasure kind of way."" This was “chop suey"" cuisine, which is distinct from “authentic"" Chinese food. The name “chop suey"" translates more or less into “assorted mix,"" and refers to a repertoire of dishes mostly developed in North America in the mid-20th century. A mix of ideas both East and West and, to my eyes, frozen in time. For my family, and every other Chinese family I knew growing up in Vancouver, food was an obsession. I would listen as relatives argued about which dim sum restaurant's har gow wrapper was the thinnest, or whose xiao long bao the juiciest. Now living in Toronto, I've witnessed first-hand the rapid development of very diverse Chinese cuisines in this city, too. I had assumed the small-town Chinese restaurant was a fading piece of the country's history, a relic of the past. But, at least on Fogo Island, that didn't seem to be the case. I wanted to know more. “They are, in very much a weird way, a Canadian thing,"" said Lily Cho, a York University professor who has written a book on Chinese restaurants. Of course there are Chinese-American restaurants in the United States, but the story up here – from the way the restaurants spread across the country along with the railroad, to the invention of dishes like Alberta ginger beef and Thunder Bay Bon Bon ribs – is uniquely Canadian. These restaurants serve many purposes, said Cho. They create jobs and opportunities for newcomers and they fill a void for the entire community, often providing services and infrastructure that don't otherwise exist. For a century and a half, they have been quintessential small-town Canadian institutions. And, she said, they aren't disappearing. Newcomers are still arriving in Canada and still moving to small towns to open Chinese restaurants. Just about every town across the country, I learned, has its own Chinese restaurant – according to some estimates, more Chinese restaurants than all fast-food restaurants combined. I had so many questions: Why would these restaurant owners take the gamble to leave everything behind for this new place? Why open a Chinese restaurant, and why in a small town? And why does just about every Canadian town have its own Chinese restaurant? I was especially intrigued by Kwang Tung: Fogo Island was probably the most isolated place I could imagine – and one of the least diverse. I scoured the Internet for more information. An image search revealed one last clue. A photographer from Montreal had visited the restaurant a few years ago, capturing an image of a faded white building. Above the door hung a Pepsi sign, with the restaurant's name etched in Charlie Chan-style lettering. In front of the restaurant stood a woman with short black hair. She looked to be in her 50s, dressed simply in a T-shirt, dark slacks and grey sneakers. Her lips curved upwards. According to the caption, her name was Huang Feng Zhu. She ran the restaurant seven days a week, by herself: “She lives upstairs so basically she never leaves."" I became determined to find Huang, to understand how she ended up running a Chinese restaurant on Fogo Island. I wanted to know how she wound up there alone. So I set out a plan: to drive across the country, visiting as many small-town Chinese restaurants as possible. I'd start on the West Coast, where the earliest wave of Chinese settlers began arriving in 1858. From there, I would make my way east across a 21/2-week period, roughly tracing the path of the railway. The last stop would be Fogo Island, where I hoped to visit Huang at the mysterious Kwang Tung Restaurant. Guests of Gold Mountain The first Chinese workers arrived on Vancouver Island in the mid-19th century. As they stepped off their ships from their long journey, Victoria was their first glimpse of this new country and their first step in their search for gold. A few decades later, between 1881 and 1885, thousands more would land here, for the promise of $1 a day, working to build the railway. An entire infrastructure sprang up around these men, creating Canada's first Chinatown along a four-block stretch of the city's downtown. Some of them opened cafés and shops where labourers could stock up on supplies, have a meal or spend the night before the final leg of their journey to the Cariboo in search of gold, or to find back-breaking work on the railway that would eventually unify this country. On a grey, rainy morning in mid-March, I flew from Toronto to Victoria, picked up a tiny rental car and drove straight toward this Chinatown. But if I had hoped to gain insight into the experiences of early settlers, I was out of luck. Chinatown's labyrinth of brick buildings and narrow alleyways – once crowded with tenements and brothels – is now the site of coffee shops and office space for tech startups. By the mid-20th century, many of the city's Chinese had moved to Vancouver and across the country, essentially leaving Victoria as a museum, a Chinatown for tourists with street fixtures decorated in red and gold dragons. Only a few hints of the original Chinese remain, like the Chinese public school that was built in 1909 after locals complained that the Chinese children enrolled in regular public schools didn't belong. On the second day of my trip, in Vancouver, I sat with history professor Henry Yu in a cafeteria on the lush green University of British Columbia campus. “Nobody goes halfway around the world on a whim,"" he said. He explained that before anything else, I'd first have to understand Gold Mountain. Gum san, or Gold Mountain, was the nickname the first Chinese workers – the gold-rushseekers and the railway builders – gave to this place. Up until the mid-20th century almost all of Canada's Chinese immigrants came from the southern Guangdong province, an area clustered around the Pearl River delta and prone to floods, earthquakes and drought. The vast majority came from the same four povertystricken counties: Toisan, Hoyping, Yinping and Sunwui. What these early settlers had in common was a wealthy relative who had gone abroad. Known as the “guests of Gold Mountain,"" these first adventurers had returned to China with unthinkable luxuries, like Singer sewing machines. They built houses for their families and schools where their children could study. Their younger relatives all heard the same story: that if they left behind their lives in China for Gold Mountain, they, too, could bring back riches. The young men watched their heroes with stars in their eyes, said Yu. “They thought to themselves: ‘I want to be that guy. Wherever he went, I want to go."" What many people still don't understand, Yu said, is that Gold Mountain wasn't simply a place. The Chinese called the mountains surrounding the Fraser Valley Gold Mountain. But they also called the golden wheat fields of the Prairies and the lush green forests of Northern Ontario Gold Mountain. The United States was Gold Mountain, too. So was Australia. To them, Gold Mountain was the whole idea – a life cycle where young men from poor families could go abroad and strike it rich enough to change their family's destiny. But that required an initial cash investment, which was generally borrowed from a relative who had already made it in Gold Mountain. The loan would normally take a few years to pay off, especially because of anti-Chinese laws that prevented these early immigrants from working in all but a few businesses: laundries, convenience stores or restaurants. Early cafés were Chinese only by virtue of their owners – the menus generally listed Western dishes, like hot turkey sandwiches and fried veal cutlets. Once the loans were paid off, these men were free to set up their own business. To avoid competition, they would often start it in the next town or railway stop over. Slowly and gradually, these restaurants multiplied, appearing first in major cities, and then spreading outward, like spiderwebs. Anywhere the railway stopped – through the Rockies, the Prairies, out east – the restaurants would also travel, until they were all across the country. As I drove around Vancouver, I saw few signs of the original Chinese cafés. Chinese food in the city today reflects the many waves of immigrants that have come since. My own parents moved from Hong Kong and Guangdong to Canada in the 1970s. They weren't alone. After Canada liberalized its immigration policy in the late 1960s, massive numbers of Hong Kongers and Taiwanese came to Vancouver, among them highly skilled, mostly Cantonese-trained chefs. Recently, the Chinese food has gotten even better. Newcomers from all over mainland China have brought with them wealth – as evidenced by gilded seafood restaurants serving $100-a-plate fried rice – and a rich diversity of regional cuisines. Driving past Richmond, the Vancouver suburb where many recent immigrants have settled, I passed crowded strip malls selling everything from mala Sichuanese, Shanghai crab dumplings, to fragrant Hainanese chicken rice. I wondered what this dizzying mix had in common with Huang, her fried egg rolls and her little restaurant in Fogo. At every step, I was putting together more pieces of her puzzle. The name of her restaurant, Kwang Tung, was just another way to spell Guangdong. Canton, Kwang Tung, Guangdong – they all refer to the same southern province from where the Gold Mountain men had originally come. It was likely, I thought, that Huang had already been here for some time. I remembered Yu's last words before he dashed off. “What connects it all is family,"" he said. Chinese newcomers rarely still refer to this place as Gold Mountain, he said. But their motivation for coming here – and for immigrants from all over the world since – is often still the same: a promise of a better future for the next generation. “The restaurants are just the vehicles. It's all about the families."" The community living room The next leg of my trip was the long drive out of Vancouver and into Alberta. For days, the mountains had gawked down at me, like giants at a parade. Now, as I inched further east, the mountains gave way to massive plains and wide, open road. The sky felt bigger. Bluer. This was where, in the latter half of the 19th century, the Canadian government offered cheap and free land to European, American and eastern Canadian settlers, in an attempt to encourage mass settlement: Promising a better life to those willing to take on a rugged space with harsh climates and long, lonely winters. As I drove, I wondered about these settlers and what they had in common with Huang. I wondered what feelings they all shared about leaving behind their homes to come to this new, hostile place. Was it desperation? Ambition? Hope? In the Prairies, I would find all three. About a 40-minute drive west of Edmonton, beyond the industrial sprawl of the city and amid long stretches of farmland, is the 15,000-person town of Stony Plain, Alta. On most weekends, you can find William Choy cooking in the kitchen at Bing's #1 Restaurant. It shouldn't be unusual that Choy works in the kitchen. After all, the mild-mannered, bespectacled 42-year-old owns the restaurant and grew up in it, too. As a child, he watched as his grandfather Bing Choy, who opened the place in 1970, worked in the same crowded kitchen. And by the time his own father Fon Choy took over, Choy himself was old enough to help out – wiping down the red formica tables, topping up cups with coffee, and whatever else needed doing. But what makes it unusual is Choy's part-time job: He's also the mayor of the town. Like most of the Gold Mountain men, Bing Choy left his wife and children behind when he came to Canada in the mid-1960s. That's in part because it was cheaper for the families to stay in China, but also because of restrictions on immigration. To protect jobs for non-Chinese Canadians, the government imposed a head tax in the late 19th century on Chinese entering the country. This was followed in 1923 by the Chinese Immigration Act, which closed off Chinese immigration almost entirely until 1947. This legalized discrimination set the tone for anti-Chinese sentiments across the country – including in cities like Vancouver and Toronto, where Chinese restaurant owners were subject to police harassment, as well as violence and vandalism. It wasn't until 1967 that Chinese were allowed to enter this country based on the same criteria as others. The rest of the Choy family came over in 1980, including six-year-old William, the future mayor. Many of his childhood memories revolve around the restaurant. He raced home from school at midday to help out with the lunch rush, and did his homework in the basement storage room. “Free time"" on weekends was spent helping out at the restaurant, too. It was only natural, then, that after graduating university with a teaching degree in an economic downturn, he returned to the restaurant. In 1997, he officially took over, though his parents continue to help out. Choy calls Bing's the “community living room"" and driving from town to town showed that it's not alone in serving this purpose. In Vulcan, Alta. – an 1,800person town decked out in Star Trek paraphernalia – Lin Qin's restaurant, Amy's, is where seniors' groups gather for lunch. And in Grenfell, Sask., Moon's Cafe is owned by 46-year-old recent immigrant Moon Wei who, like Huang in Fogo, runs the restaurant alone. Moon's is where elderly men spend their afternoons, nursing cups of coffee while leafing through newspapers. A few years ago, Linda Tzang, a curator at the Royal Alberta Museum, put together an exhibition on how small-town Chinese restaurants have historically served as Canada's mail-sorting facilities, child-care centres and even fire stations. “It was just whatever they could do to keep their businesses afloat,"" she said. She even came across one Alberta town where the restaurant was so crucial to the community that when the owners retired, locals recruited a new family from China to take over. Many of Canada's small-town Chinese restaurant owners spoke to me about loneliness, and feeling alienated. But for the Choy family, living in a small town made things easier, he said. Regulars would offer English lessons and other help to his parents. They'd point to their coffee cups as they were drinking, mouthing slowly the words: “Coffee. Cup."" “You're not lost in the whole mass of things,"" Choy said. “They're more willing to give a hand."" Choy and his siblings now all have houses and families of their own. “I'm the mayor of the community we grew up in,"" says Choy. “Things like that couldn't happen in China, right?"" Since Choy was first elected in 2012, he has worked both jobs, running back and forth, often pulling off a grease-splattered apron midday to attend a town meeting. “This is my business, where we came from,"" Choy told me in his kitchen, as he fried a large platter of rice. He covered his wok with a lid, then shuffled out to the dining room. Hanging on the back wall were four blackand-white photographs: pictures of the Guangdong village where Choy was born. Behind him in the kitchen, his mother Jean beamed. I asked if this is what she had imagined for her son. “No,"" the 65-year-old said in the Toisan dialect. Running for mayor was entirely his idea – entirely outside of her comprehension, and the life she knew growing up in a village in Guangdong. “How could I even have imagined it?"" Ms. Choy said, grinning her gap-toothed grin. “How could I have imagined it?"" . Chop suey in the age of oil shock It's not just the Chinese who came looking for Gold Mountain. It's a journey many continue to make today. The past few decades have seen tens of thousands of young men and women – many of them immigrants from Somalia, Jamaica and the Middle East – flock to the Prairie oil sands seeking black gold. Using pumps and shovels to extract the liquid from deep beneath the earth, they hope to fund their own version of a better life, their own Gold Mountain. But just as gold in the Cariboo didn't last, fortunes here have also changed. As common as the sight of oil rigs and cattle ranches along the highway, was the sight of pickup trucks carrying mattresses and furniture, entire lives, as young men head east and out of the prairies. As I walked into the empty dining room of Thai Woks N'go in Glendon, Alta., a Buddha-faced boy lay napping in a sunny spot across two dining chairs. At the sound of the door opening, he leaped up, eyes wide. “Customer!"" he shouted. Lan Huynh, the boy's mother, said her restaurant used to be busy. Local oil workers were making $60 an hour (to her, an unimaginable sum) and a steady stream of customers would come in, ordering the “Chinese pierogis."" Glendon has a large Ukranian population, and a sculpture across the street from the restaurant is labelled the “world's largest pierogi"" – Lan serves a Chinese version, similar to regular Chinese dumplings, stuffed with meat and vegetables and deep-fried until crispy. She also serves Ukrainian ones, light and fluffy, with fried sausage, onions and sour cream. Now many workers have been laid off. The restaurant depends on the 480 people who live here year-round, most of them also feeling the oil shock. Even with business slowing down, Lan isn't convinced moving is the solution. She believes, as do many others I spoke with, that small towns are better places for raising children. Plus, she said, the restaurant industry in cities like Edmonton is too competitive and the cost of living too high. In Drumheller, Alta., Peter Li told me that business has dropped by about 30 per cent at Diana, his restaurant with redvinyl booths and decorated with dragons hanging from the ceiling. In the same period, food costs have risen. “A case of broccoli is $90,"" he says. “Before, it was $30."" One of the most popular items at Diana is uniquely Chinese-Canadian: Ginger beef. The dish, first created in Calgary in the 1970s, was a loose interpretation of a northern Chinese beef dish with tangerine and chilis, but sweetened and mellowed to suit Western palates. Despite its name, it has almost no ginger in it. “The Alberta palate was so behind that they didn't recognize sweet chili sauce,"" explained Tzang, the museum curator. “They started asking for beef with ‘that ginger stuff.' "" Li is a trained chef who has worked in some of the biggest restaurants around Beijing, but when he first arrived in Drumheller he had to learn a new repertoire of chop-suey dishes: ""Egg foo young,"" and “lemon chicken."" Compared to the food Li trained to cook – delicate Cantonese dishes, or the fiery spice mix of mapo tofu – this food is much simpler to make. “For me, it's very easy,"" he said. He's tried a few times to cook here the way he'd cooked back home, but “the people here didn't really like it."" Sitting at the front counter was a jar of Lao Gan Ma chili oil – often referred to as “angry lady sauce,"" owing to the stern expression of the woman on the label. Li looked longingly at the jar of sauce, made of dried red chilis and numbing peppercorns steeped in oil. Here, it was just for display. Li has just returned from a trip back to China, where many of his former colleagues have been promoted to prestigious kitchens. He sighed. “Before, I think Canada is pretty good, right? But it's hard to make money here,"" he said. Alberta isn't the only province that's struggled from oil shock, and economic downturn. So too, has Newfoundland – where I was headed in search of Huang. Like the men in their pickup trucks, why hadn't Huang driven to another town, to the possibility of an easier life? Part two of this story can be found at tgam.ca/chopsuey."
"A Canadian Childhood; What are the quintessential experiences of growing up in Canada? For Great Big Sea's Alan Doyle, it was unloading the catch soon as school was out for summer. For Terence Corcoran, it was sneaking cheap cigarettes at Montreal's Parc Molson. And for Justin Trudeau, summers at Harrington Lake. From the PM to CEOs to your favourite authors, we have their childhood stories",NL,"Prime Minister of Canada When I think of my childhood, I think of Harrington Lake, the PM's cottage, in the heart of Gatineau Park, just north of Ottawa. As a kid, I used to wait all year for the summer. Like for so many Canadians, the summer meant getting out of the city and into the wilderness. It's where some of my earliest family memories were formed. It's where I got my first sense of how wild and wonderful Canada's environment can be. And more than any other place, it deepened my love of this country. As a young boy growing up, there wasn't a lot more you could ask for: the thick forests, the ranging hills, the brisk, blue lake. It was like the setting of a Hardy Boys novel, with adventure and intrigue lurking behind every tree - and we made the most of it. Each summer, we would don our explorer caps and strike out into the wilderness. A rundown boathouse by the lake served as our home base, and Sacha, Michel and I would take turns stretching out in the sun, jumping in the lake, and planning our next adventure. Mom and Dad were never far away. Harrington Lake was one of their favourite places to spend time together. I cherish the memory of my brothers and I scrambling to keep up with my parents as they climbed confidently through the Gatineau Hills. Or the countless nights sitting out under the stars, gathered around the campfire, listening to my father tell us stories. Harrington Lake is the home of many of my fondest childhood memories, and as summer finally comes around, I hope that it will become a special place for my children, too. KENNETH OPPEL Children's Author When I was 10 years old I lived in a neighbourhood called Clayton Park that was right on the edge of Halifax. Our road bordered a huge no-man's land construction site, where they were putting in a whole new subdivision. My friend and I would spend a ton of time playing in the construction site, where it was all rubble and big machinery. They were very casual about what they left around, so we played with all sorts of things we shouldn't have. Our favourite thing to do was climb down into the storm drain tunnels they were putting in. There were manholes, but they didn't have tops on them yet. We would climb down these shafts, run through the pipes, and come up in another manhole. We spent a long time doing this and planning adventures to see how far we could go, but we always chickened out - we never went too far. One of our plans was to get a shopping cart, put a flashlight on the front, and travel underground through the tunnels. It was just a mad dream; it never came to fruition. It's the kind of thing that I think was a spurt of my own creativity. I was scribbling down stories even then, so this was exactly the kind of adventure I wished I could have gone on as a kid. - As told to Laura Hensley RONA AMBROSE Interim leader, Conservative Party of Canada Although I was born in Canada, I spent much of my childhood living in different countries around the world. My brothers and I attended international schools and it was a fantastic opportunity to experience all the different cultures that were represented by my classmates from all around the world, and share my own. One of the things our teachers often liked to have us do was to come to school ""dressed as your country."" In this picture my brother James and I are dressed in Mountie uniforms - that my mum made by hand. All around the world this is a recognizable symbol of Canada. No matter where we lived, our parents made sure we learned about our Canadian heritage and we always wore those Mountie uniforms as the proud Canadians that we remain today. RUSSELL WANGERSKY Author I grew up Canadian without even being Canadian, though I didn't pay much attention to that at the time. I was born a few short years before my parents, both American, moved to Halifax where my father was to become an oceanography professor at Dalhousie. I quickly learned distinctly Canadian things: collecting hockey cards (lost, perhaps in my mother's great purge of my bedroom when I went to university), crafting the perfect ice-glazed snowball, and, when I went to a neighbourhood school, I learned to make sure ""neighbourhood"" had a ""u"" in it always. I didn't play ice hockey, but I did play street hockey. I also canoed and camped - my mother's one great splurge was to buy a family-sized freight canoe from the legend of East Coast canoe builders, Middleton's Harold Gates - and fished for mackerel and cod with my father. But for me, Canada meant being on the road. ""We're going on an expedition,"" my mother would say, sounding like we were heading for Everest, but packing a lunch for the day or camping gear for the weekend. Expeditions were not optional; most goodweather weekends, we went somewhere, building our maps of eastern provinces. We'd head for the remnants of old Nova Scotian gold mining claims, for long Bay of Fundy beaches where you can sink into the low-tide silty mud well above your ankles. We'd be dragooned into working Annapolis Valley u-picks for my mother's deep freeze, picking strawberries, raspberries and once, sour pie cherries. And we kept records. There was always a logbook in the glove compartment of the van, and flipping through it, you could find four distinct samples of handwriting - Mom, Dad, my brother Charles and me. (George, six years later than me, was too little to keep log.) We kept diligent track of distances travelled, road conditions and the time it took to travel each definable section of road. Odometer readings of the distance to Lunenburg and the time it took to travel the road to Yarmouth. Battered highways through New Brunswick and into Maine. There were notes, too, about places worth visiting and others we'd never go to again. Later, on a sabbatical in Spain, the log, or variants of it, started to contain soaked-off labels from wine and beer bottles and notes on whether the contents had been worth buying. After 1972 and my mother's discovery of a thicket of wild anise, the logbook smelled of licorice and, for years, you could find stray seeds to chew on if you felt carsick. We logged trips to Nova Scotia's great beaches, to fishing towns and storefront clams-and-chips joints, and my father laughed - he always laughed - as we drove past the signs for Upper, Lower and Middle Economy. (He laughed easily: a regular joke was to point at signs saying ""Lots for Sale"" and say ""Lots for sale? Lots of what?"") And I took part in drawing a map and tracking the measures of my new world. My one great regret? The logbooks, like my hockey cards, are gone. When I crossed the Canada/U.S. border on that very first big expedition, a trip I'm sure my parents recorded carefully, my one clear memory of the trip is seeing the curve of the vacuum cleaner hose against the back window of the car. It's no surprise to me that, at the earliest instant we could, my whole family became Canadians. I'm glad my parents had no fear of taking to the road. Because of that, we found home. Columnist First, a clarification of terms: Karnatzel is not Karnatzlach. Karnaztlach is a well-loved Romanian dish, a spiced hamburger patty. Karnatzel, which I will be getting to in a minute, is a skinny dry beef sausage, a two-foot long thing you usually find hanging from a rod behind the heads of deli counter workers in Montreal. When, in Montreal, somebody comes home, and heaves a bag of deli onto their kitchen table, and amid the flat-packed smoked meat and tubs of slaw there is a very long paper envelope reeking of garlic, those waiting for lunch know: there will be karnatzel, a food so delicious I stopped buying it years ago, because the length of it would disappear overnight, my husband returning to bed at 1 a.m. two pounds heavier, several degrees less healthy, and, well, smelling like Jewish garlic sausage. Sometimes your brain throws you an image, a kind of flash card. The other day, for a split second, it was 1980. I am standing on a green lawn in the Laurentians, seven years old, in a bathing suit and rainbow flip flops. Between the fragrant cedar and the chickadee fee-faws and the dark green, trout-filled lake, there is a man, possibly in an apron, definitely named Solly, unloading ropes of karnatzel from the back of a truck in front of my father's cottage. My dad is standing near me, cash in hand, swallowing hard. I have been chastised in the past for writing that I find the idea of Jews in the country funny. I know that the Jew as unshakeable cosmopolitan is a cliché. But quite honestly, the Jew as a erson of the city has also been a truth since the dawn of the diaspora, when this law or that law prevented nearly every Jewish human on the planet from owning land. It's why even our ultra-orthodox fringe, the Hassids, the group, who like the Amish and the Mennonites, want to live apart from the contemporary, still have their neighbourhoods in the middle of metropolises. The city is in the Jewish DA. Still, everyone likes to get away in the summer. In the 1950s, my grandparents used to rent a little white shack at a place called Trout Lake, near Ste-Agathe, where everyone was a Goldstein or a Shatzky or a Waxman. Nearby, in Ste-Agathe, there was a notorious club sign that read ""No Dogs or Jews."" But Trout Lake had Bubbies playing Pinochle on lawn chairs, and kiddie camp called Makabee, and there was always cholent in someone's icebox. My father, a Makabee alumnus, loved the Laurentians. Right out of law school, after having landed his first real job, he bought a small house in Ste-Adele. So did his counterparts, the children of the Goldsteins, the Shatzkys and the Waxmans of Trout Lake. For these Duddy Kravitzes, the time to settle the great Canadian wilderness had arrived. Ski hills were carved down virgin mountains, lakes were keyed with docks, lawn mowers ran wild. In the 1970s and early 1980s, there were so many Jews with cottages in the Laurentians, that a Jewish food truck was a viable business. Solly's ran up and down dirt roads every weekend and holiday, delivering cheese Danish, blintzes, matzoh balls, and what Montreal's famous Shwartz's Delicatessen now calls, on its website, with a pomp only our current foodie era could call up, ""Hebraic charcuterie."" Back then nothing was so rarified. A half pound of chopped liver was a half pound of chopped liver. Jews - even the sort trying nature on like a new style of pants - still ate a lot of Jewish food. So there I was, standing on the grass, with my dad, looking at karnatzel, and it's a little comic, but it is also poignant, the way New York's Catskill region (a place Mordecai Richler called ""Disneyland with knishes"") is to many Jews poignant. Because here was an unlikely but lively Jewish culture, and now it is a shadow of itself. For the most part, these cottage communities of the Laurentians, once so rife with Hebraic charcuterie, have snapped back to a more historic diet of tourtière. In the deeply Jewish west end of Montreal, there is a delicatessen called Solly's. You can buy their stuff in supermarkets, too: matzoh ball soup, chopped liver, cheese blintzes. It never occurred to me before, but in writing this, suddenly it did: maybe it's the same Solly? I called the place and they told me no. What was surprising was how much I wanted it to be yes: to think that, between this sunny chapter of my childhood and now, there was a continuity - even if in garlic sausage. MICHAEL BUDMAN Co-founder of Roots Canada The first time I came to Canada was on July 1, 1956. I was 10 years old, and I was heading for the very first time from Detroit, where I lived, to Camp Tamakwa in Algonquin Park, Ont. We got up at 3 a.m. - it was very hot - to go to the train station and catch the 5 a.m. train to Toronto. All the kids coming to camp from Detroit and London, Ont., were on that train. When we got to Union Station in Toronto, there must have been at least 100 of us as we sat outside and waited for the camp buses to come. I always have an image of that day in my life, sitting there and looking up at the Royal York hotel, which at the time had a slogan like 'the tallest hotel in the British Empire.' Everything was different from America, and I felt it right from the get go. The bus drove us up Yonge Street and we stopped in Orillia for lunch. We went to the Champlain Hotel, which is still there, for dry turkey sandwiches. We wandered around the town a bit and bought Mackintosh candy. Back then, the Canadian dollar was worth 25 cents more than the US dollar. The bus drove for several more hours to Algonquin Park and we drove inside the gates and then took a boat to camp. When I got off that boat, everything in my life changed. I saw all these big, good-looking terrific staff members wearing lumberjack shirts and rubber boots. That image stuck with me and it had a great influence on my role at Roots. It was one of the most important days in my life. Camp really became the major influence of my life. (Roots co-founder Don Green) and I met in 1962 at camp, and he loves that park too. I have leased my own cabin in Algonquin Park since 1968, and in that little cabin in 1968 we came up with the idea of Roots. I feel very fortunate every day to live in Canada. Moving here was the best single decision I made in my life. - As told to Hollie Shaw CHRISTIE BLATCHFORD Columnist Rouyn-Noranda, Que., was a Canadian company town - the hyphenated name notwithstanding, it sure felt like one town - much of the place built around the copper mine and smelter owned by Noranda Mines. The mine owned pretty much everything at one point, including the house my family lived in and which we, like most people, rented for an absurdly low sum, $80 a month I think it was. Years later when the mine ran out of copper and closed, Rouyn-Noranda did not wither and die. My brother, nephew and I went for a visit a couple of years ago, and it's thriving, a smart, sophisticated regional Quebec government centre with double the population it had when I was born. In the late 50s and 60s, it was a magnificent place to grow up, especially in the short, intense northern summers. My friends and I were gone from our houses the whole day, rode our bikes down to Lake Osisko, played on and around the tailings from the smelter, picked wild blueberries, spent hours in what was then the only swimming pool in town and in the evenings, as our mothers called us home, had cartwheel contests and crabwalk races on our tiny front lawns. In 1967, we moved to Toronto, but the following summer, I got to go back to Noranda to work at my beloved pool as a lifeguard. I lived with my best friend, Carolyn Brown, and her family, right next door to where we'd lived. I was on my own, sort of, my parents 640 glorious klicks away, and it felt like freedom. My parents had been sort of wheels in town, the way ordinary people can be in such places. In the winter, my dad ran the recreation centre and in summer the golf course, both owned by the mine, and my mother was a great athlete and a bit of a star. My big brother had made his own name, even if part of that was as a member of the Blind Backfield on the high school football team. Now, I was out from under their collective shadow. And while I liked everything about it - my friend Carrie and her folks, the underage drinking we were all able to do (at places like the Radio Hotel and Maroon Lounge, the owners would usually get a heads up if the cops were on their way), the actual job (walking the pool deck daily, I fell in love with the smell of wet concrete), the dances we went to at the rec - my secret goal was to prove myself not a good girl. To that end, I did my first real drinking (Singapore Slings and Zombies) and wasn't very good at it, at least once a week hurling in the little garbage can by my bed as I fell asleep. Poor Mrs. Brown was so solicitous, concerned that whole summer about the state of my stomach. I was also smoking cigarettes; they made me sick at first too. And I was boy-crazy. But as desperate as I was not to be a virgin any more, I was too shy and awkward (and to my chagrin, still too selective) to be successful. But for those two short months, I burned my candle at both ends and for the first time, saw, in the words of the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, that it gives a lovely light. ALAN DOYLE Musician Author Petty Harbour, N.L., is only a short drive from the city of St. John's, but for a 12-year-old in a family with no car in the early 1980s, the steep hills and narrow harbour of the tiny fishing village I called home might as well have been a million miles from everywhere. We had very little, but made a lot of it. I suppose, in retrospect, we had to. The first day of summer holidays was always my favourite day as we got to head directly to the wharf and start working with local fishermen in the allconsuming inshore cod fishery. The boys' jobs were quite simple but very important. We helped unload the day's catch and keep the splitting tables filled and the boats' holds clean. In exchange for our services, the fishermen let us cut out and sell the cod's tongues, which were in high demand for local supermarkets, St. John's restaurants and tourists alike. After a long school year with empty pockets, it felt so great to walk home with 20 or 30 or 40 bucks in your gurry stained pants. I'd tell Mom I made half of what I did and put some money away for hockey as she wished, and sneak off with 10-15 dollars to spend on whatever mischief I could get up to. First stop would be a local swimming hole where all the guys and gals from as young as 10 to as old as late teens would gather to strip off and usher in the summer in the water. I'd do my best dives, tell my best jokes, and maybe even sing a song to try and impress the older girls there, and if the stars aligned, a fella might be lucky enough to sneak a smooch on the way home as the sun gave way to the stars. The first day of summer in Petty Harbour was probably not much like it was in a big city like Toronto or in the mountains of Alberta or the Prairies of Saskatchewan. In Petty Harbour, the first day of summer meant for me and my friends, that we could be both adults and kids at the same time. We could work like a grown-up, but party like an adolescent. The best of both worlds in one day. JENNIFER ROBSON Author I usually tell people that I grew up in Peterborough, Ont., but that's not true, not precisely. I come from a smaller place, a quieter place. It's a few kilometres south of the city and is named after its only public building, an unremarkable community hall with a library in its basement. Stewart Hall. It doesn't even show up on most maps. A crossroads, scarcely more. My parents' house was just up the hill, a long, low, cedar-clad structure that was a deliberate homage to their West Coast roots. We didn't have a cottage and we never went camping, although we did have a big tent my parents would put up once a summer so we could have sleepovers under the stars. (The mosquitoes and the smell of mildewy canvas nearly always drove me inside before midnight.) I remember running across the gravelled driveway, which hurt my feet in May but felt like nothing by August, to the treehouse Dad put up for my sister and me. It was really just a shed on stilts, nestled under the lowest branches of a stand of pine trees, and I can't recall anything about its interior. My favourite spot was on its roof, a slab of buckling plywood that I reached via an intricate series of footholds, a sheltered bower that was quiet and coolly green even on the hottest days. Katie and I watched TV in the mornings, a mind-numbing brew of cartoons and American game shows, but it never held our attention for long. Out we'd go, exploring the meadows stretching west from the house, slipping into the forbidden, gloomy old barn, and returning only to gobble down Popsicles from the basement freezer. Then back out to the treehouse, library books our only cargo, and the painstaking ascent to the still and solemn sanctuary of its roof. Forty years ago. My childhood feels as distant as the stars, and still I remember. In my dreams I fly there, leaving Toronto and the cares of adult life behind; and when I land at Stewart Hall the treehouse still stands, the house is just as I remember, and my mother is at the side door, calling me in, calling me home. GUY GAVRIEL KAY Author The Canada in which I grew up more than half a century ago, is not today's Canada. That's been true for any generation you can name. Change can be for good or ill, but it always comes. What seems more important today is to think about how fortunate we are as a country, and let that awareness guide our actions. When Wilfrid Laurier said in 1904 that the 20th century might ""belong to Canada"" he was speaking with the pride of an emerging country's leader, and some hubris perhaps. But as e address the issues of the future in the second decade of the 21st century is there any place better from which to do that? I don't think so, and I remember feeling the same way, instinctively, growing up in Winnipeg. GARY CLEMENT Cartoonist HARJIT SAJJAN Defence Minister We were probably the only kids who hoped for a longer school year and wished it rained every summer day. That was the only way my sister and I would get out of berry picking. After my family immigrated from India to Vancouver, my mom would work during the summer months on berry farms. Every summer day we would get picked up at sunrise and not get home until sunset. My sister would spend the day teasing me, because I had two main goals: playing in the dirt and eating lunch. Berry picking is tough. Depending on what you're picking, you're on your hands and knees hard my mom had to work-and how she did all that work for us. I met a lot of friends, many of whom are very successful now, in those fields picking berries with their immigrant parents. ARTHUR MCDONALD Nobel Prize-winning Astrophysicist Cape Breton is a special place with hard working, genuine people who have a great sense of humour, the ability to enjoy life through family and friends, and a real love for their hometown. In high school, I belonged to a club called Hi Y, which was my central social group. I met my wife, Janet, through that. Our social life revolved around club meetings and dances every Friday and the general teen dance that we ran on Saturday nights at the YMCA. My wife and I still love to dance. Education was important in the community, and I was particularly inspired by an excellent math teacher at Sydney Academy: Bob Chafe. Five of our graduating class became university professors. Today, I still remember special summer holidays that we took as a family to Englishtown, Cape Breton, where I spent a lot of time fishing with my father around age 10. You could catch lots of big fish right off the shore there. I still remember that excitement and the pure relaxation. SCOTT STINSON Sports Columnist My late grandfather was a storyteller, and some of them were even mostly true. So I can't say with total certainty that the story he once told me about the hockey-playing Hunter brothers was wholly accurate, but it came back to me vividly one summer. I was in my early teens, and staying for a week in Sarnia, down in Ontario's oil (refinery) country, at the home of an aunt and uncle. My younger cousin, who was a very good hockey player, was attending a hockey school run by Kerry Fraser, the NHL referee with the fantastic hair, and Dale Hunter, at the time an NHL player with a mean streak that ran to the horizon and now the owner of the London Knights. I was not a very good hockey player, but I attended the school for that week alongside my cousin and his peers, mostly as a make-work project. One day, the kids were going through drills on contact hockey - how to take a check, how to deliver one - because they would soon be of body-checking age. I was already there, and had played contact hockey for a couple of years, so I was drafted into the role of check-deliverer. I would skate backward along the boards, the kids would try to slip by me, and I would hip check them or otherwise paste them into the glass. It was, I have to say, highly satisfying. You could go entire games without ever really having the chance to line someone up for a good hit, and here they were - smaller people, even! - being fed to you as though off an assembly line. For one shining moment I was the living tween embodiment of Scott Stevens, and I applied kid after kid to the boards like wallpaper. (I probably only executed one or two perfect hits, but this is a 30-year-old memory and I will indulge how I choose.) So, the drill ends. Hunter, who had been off to the side, skated over. ""Your turn,"" he said. I was supposed to try to get by him. We pause here for my grandfather's story. My grandpa John was friends with the patriarch of the Hunter clan, three of whom - Dale, Dave and Mark - had long NHL careers. He would visit the Hunter farm in Petrolia from time to time. One day, he said, he was sitting in the kitchen when two of the brothers rolled into the room in the midst of a fight. Like, literally rolled in there, the way there was a cloud of dust in a Bugs Bunny cartoon with limbs occasionally shooting out. The father hollered at them to knock it off already, when the third brother came in - I'm not naming which because Grandpa wasn't sure but also for legal reasons that will become obvious - with a shovel and flat-out whacked the other two in the noggin with it. Fight over, Hunter style. So, there I was at the hockey school, and I did not have a shovel. I have no idea if Hunter felt I had a bit too much fun bodychecking smaller players, but it's fair to say I probably violated The Code. And lo, punishment was swift. I skated along the boards, saw a gap - and Hunter lifted me off the ground and walloped me into the boards in a manner appropriate of a player who amassed 3,565 penalty minutes in the NHL. I crumpled to the ice. The kids cheered. It was the only time I did a summer hockey school, but it was eventful. SANDY TREAGUS CFO, Mountain Equipment Co-op Although I grew up in South Africa, I spent a year in Canada as part of a youth exchange to the Okanagan. I arrived in Canada in 1985, fully prepped with my father's warmest coat for the famed Canadian winter. And while I loved the snow and winter sports, my best memories from that trip came from the summer. In South Africa, most water holidays were spent at the beach, but I soon discovered the amazing lakes we have in Canada, particularly Okanagan and Shuswap lakes. It was a summer of many firsts outdoors - my first time canoeing, my first time kayaking, my first time rock climbing and my first time starting a fire with a wooden bow. My opportunity to experience outdoor activities came through an organization connecting youth to the outdoors. As part of the outdoor program I was in, a lot of the gear I used was donated. I was a bigger kid, and my outdoor instructor was a bit of a MacGyver, always ensuring it would fit and that it wasn't going to quit on you. Since that time, I've never underestimated the confidence that the right piece of gear and advice can instil. After that exchange I felt a strong connection to anada. In 1999, my wife and I decided to relocate from South Africa to raise our children in British Columbia, first in Whistler, and then in Vancouver where I started in my role at MEC. We feel truly blessed to live in this great city, with so much opportunity for activity and such ready access to so many beautiful and unspoilt wild spaces. Looking back to that summer spent in the Okanagan, I'm proud now to be part of a business that helps people experience the rewards of being outside. RICHARD GARNEAU CEO, Resolute Forest Products I grew up on a dairy farm in St-Prime on Lac Saint-Jean, about 200 kilometres north of Quebec City. My parents had 200 acres, five children and 30 cows. I am the eldest, with two brothers and two sisters. We had to work very hard to make ends meet. Everyone had a job to do. The boys helped our father in the field and the girls helped our mom in the kitchen. We had no plumbing, just an outhouse behind the house, but then my dad rigged up a water frame around the kitchen stove, a network of pipes that warmed the water for our baths. He was pretty ingenious. My father would wake us up at 5:30. Spring, summer, and fall, I fetched the cows in the field and brought them into the stable. My job was to milk three of the cows by hand, morning and night. We dumped the milk into urns. Then we'd haul the urns down the dirt road and pour the milk into a reservoir at the cheese factory. We were poor but we had everything we needed. We didn't have a tractor, so we loaded the hay on wagons with pitchforks. Someone up in the wagon would stamp down the hay. All the neighbours worked together. In the spring we planted the crops. We were very religious: my mom, the chaplain in our family, led us in evening prayers. Sunday, we drove to church in my dad's pickup truck. In summer the kids rode in the truck bed. In winter the two smallest sat on the front bench between my parents, and the three elder kids squeezed in the space behind the truck's seat and the back of the cab, for shelter from the cold on our way to Sunday mass. There was no money to send me to university. My father knew the owner of the local sawmill, Scierie Lamontagne, who gave me a job as a lumberjack. I bought a used McCulloch chainsaw from my cousin for $40, and repaid him in installments, a few dollars every week. For three summers I lived in the logging camp, about 50 km from my home. They fed us tourtière, potatoes, stew and ham. For breakfast we ate eggs and toast and beans with pork, smothered with molasses. At night we'd sit around and talk and sharpen our chainsaws. - As told to Peter Kuitenbrouwer NATHAN CULLEN Federal NDP MP Earliest and some of my best memories growing up in Canada took place in the concrete jungle that was the schoolyard of my elementary school in what was then York, now Toronto. We had a small patch of dirt and trees that staged our reenactments for Star Wars and the A-Team in equal measure. It was the UN of grade schools with Italian, Greek, Portuguese, Irish, Scots, English, Caribbean, Iraqi, Irani, Chinese, Korean, Serb and Croat to name just the kids that lived on the street that took me to school. All newly arrived, with none being past first-generation Canadians. Muslim, Christian, Jewish and all points in between yet dutifully (except for the JW kids) we sang the anthem, then recited the Lord's Prayer each day. Parent-teacher night was a swirl of accents and strangely scented foods that were given to our teachers in thanks. I don't know if there was anything resembling what it was to be a Canadian in this swirl of cultures and history. Yet there were the ties that bind - hard, simple work on construction sites and deli counters; steady, diligent progress through a school system built for a world that no longer existed. My Canada was this Canada - a happy, searching, striving and peaceful place where being a kid was the only passport needed. J.J. WILSON Brand director, Kit and Ace, Son of Lululemon founder, Chip Wilson A large part of my childhood was spent growing up in Vancouver's beachside Kitsilano neighbourhood. At the time we were living on the top floor of an apartment building on Yew Street in Kits - my brother Brett and I, and our dad. We spent our entire summer hanging out between the Kits pool and the Westbeach store on Fourth Avenue, and then later at the first Lululemon store, also on Fourth. Every summer day was pretty much the same, for many years. Chip was an avid Grouse Grind fanatic (a three-kilometre hike up the face of Grouse Mountain). At the age of eight to 12, you better believe that that man made us do the Grouse Grind with him. If the strategy was to tire out his kids nice and early in the morning, he did a good job. That was usually followed up by a promise of ice cream. We would come home from the Grouse Grind, shower up, get on our bikes and then go for a bike ride along the seawall from Kits, along the beach all the way to the planetarium, up and through Granville Island, edging our way along English Bay and then up around Stanley Park. Following that, we would spend the early part of the afternoon in the stores. There was a skateboard ramp in the back of the Kits Westbeach, and I remember spending a good chunk of time there. We would spend about three hours doing chores or getting Starbucks drinks for the staff. In exchange we would get Pokemon cards at this really cool comic store. Then we would head down to Kits Pool until about 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. pretty much every single night. Then we would go to Capers and get a watermelon, and chips and salsa and Big Yummies, these protein-packed healthy peanut butter smoothie-type things. Chip would try to convince us that they were chocolate milkshakes. We spent a great deal of our time back then shirtless and shoeless, we were so close to the pool and the beach. Back then in Kits and under the age of 15, shirts and shoes were just kind of optional - it was still pretty hippie and relaxed, and pretty green. Kits is where I really have my best summer memories. I later moved to Toronto and then to New York, and when I moved back to Vancouver in 2012, I moved back to Kits. - As told to Hollie Shaw JEANNE BEKER Fashion Journalist Entrepreneur My parents were Holocaust survivors who came over in 1948 totally penniless. They came from a DP camp in Austria, after they lived through the war in Poland. They came to Canada with all these amazing hopes and dreams, and the faith that they would be able to rise above the ashes in this incredible country. They had a variety of little jobs that paid practically nothing, but my dad managed to scrape enough together to buy a house on Delaware Avenue in Toronto in 1952. He couldn't sustain a house just for our family, so he rented out a lot of the different rooms in the home. It was a big three-storey house but we only lived on the main floor. Upstairs, there were all these different people always coming and going, from all these wonderful different countries, who were new immigrants just getting started themselves. Even though I had such a small family, I grew up with this extended international family that was really a cultural mosaic. In retrospect, it was kind of a microcosm of what this country is all about. I remember sitting downstairs at the kitchen table and my dad would invite what we called ""the roomers,"" and they would come down and talk to us, and tell us about their history and struggles. It was just fascinating for me; growing up like that as a little kid and seeing the world through that particular lens. That whole spirit of my dad's incredible generosity and my parents' absolute love of people really made me who I am. - As told to Laura Hensley TERENCE CORCORAN Columnist It never rains on Parc Molson, a two-block treed urban wonderland in East End Montreal where - as it is fixed in my memory - the sun beams down all day and every day, and every Wednesday as the sun sets a military band plays in the bandstand in the centre of the park, filling the swampy Montreal summer nights with marches and renditions of popular tunes of the day. In the early 1950s, an 11-year-old boy had everything he needed in Parc Molson, in the heart of Rosemount, a working class Montreal neighbourhood - Irish, English, French - that was rebranded La Petite Patrie for what would appear to be nationalist motives in the 1970s. Such political concerns were unheard of in the 1950s, where my brother and I learned French on the street in front of our third-floor flat with the classic Montreal winding staircase. The worst culture clash was when French kids would call us ""maudit bloke"" while we walked past their school on the way to ours, St. Brendan's, six blocks away. The only girl around was Francine, a bit of a tomboy but she was older and frankly I had no interest in girls then. Cigarettes were a lot more fascinating, especially a lowcost brand called Golden Gate that came in small packages of 10 or something. Summer revolved around playing baseball in the park, even though there were no ball diamonds. We made them up, with markers for bases and, since there were only a few of us, usually just a first base would be enough for an excuse to pitch and hit and run to first and back. It was around this time Dad took me to Delorimier Stadium to watch the Montreal Royals play Syracuse or some such team. It was one of the great, intimate ballparks. We were on the first base line, and I came to idolize the Royals' first base star, Rocky Nelson. When we played our pick-up games in the park I was always Rocky Nelson on first. Parc Molson is still what it was, a great modest Montreal urban oasis designed for strolling and bench-sitting and which still has a plain but beautiful bandstand in the centre where summer concerts are performed. As I said, it never rains in my memories of Parc Molson, where you could play ball, run and - if you were lucky enough to have five cents - you could smoke cheap Golden Gate cigarettes, which is all an 11-year-old really needed. BRIAN BOWMAN Mayor of Winnipeg By and large, Winnipeg has always been home. I was born in the north end and raised in the south end. I grew up in Charleswood. At the time, it felt very rural. We had a massive field behind our house, a chicken coop in the backyard. Every year, we had a skating rink and a bonfire pit and a horseshoe pit. It was a very rural way to grow up in the city. It was great. We're right here in the geographic centre of Canada, and it felt very Canadian. In the winters, we spent a lot of time outside. Some of my fondest memories were playing hockey in the backyard. I was a Varsity View Falcon, and our local community centre was down the street. It had three sheets of outdoor ice. At the end of the school day, everybody would go home, but as soon as dinner was done, I was back at the rink. There were no iPhones. There was no texting or emails. We wouldn't even phone our friends. You would just show up at the rink, and that's where all your buddies were. We spent hours freezing our toes and drinking terrible hot chocolate to warm up. I probably sometimes poured it on my toes. When we'd shift gears from the rink, in the summer, it would very quickly convert into street hockey. When it was exam period in school, a lot of our friends - we would all get together to ""study."" It was either street hockey or table hockey. We would do round robins, and have probably 20 or 30 classmates all ""studying."" I think Winnipeg is a quintessential Canadian city. Today, I see Winnipeg becoming even more multicultural and more diverse than it's ever been - something the vast majority of Winnipeggers see as a source of strength. We don't thrive as a community in spite of our differences, but because of them. - As told to Nick Faris DREW AND JONATHAN SCOTT The Property Brothers Drew: Any twin would tell you they're the closest of siblings. It's really a built-in best friend growing up - a built in annoying best friend. As toddlers we were less work than our older brother because we would entertain each other. Jon: We used to go out into the forest by our house and find big sticks and use them as swords and duel and learn karate. Drew: My mom said that Jonathan and I would each switch roles every few weeks. Jon: Any time we do a show now, we try to do something that flashes back to family. When we renovated my parents' place, we designed a table that was a replica of the old coffee table that my father had branded with all the ranches he had worked at and that we learned to walk around. Drew: My parents always encouraged us to have a creative mind, and that's helped us in what we do and seeing potential in homes. We would make up something about what we were doing that day or we would try to pretend we were knights because we were Scottish and liked dressing up. I remember there was one play we did, we called it sisterly love. It was us and one of our other friends: Three guys playing three sisters. Jonathan was the annoying little sister. - As told to David Rudin THOMAS MULCAIR Federal NDP leader For me and my siblings growing up, summer meant the lake and the lake meant freedom. We were 10 kids and our parents gave us free reign once we got to Ste-Annedes- Lacs. We all grew up swimming, canoeing and hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter. Mom and Dad met and married there. Catherine and I met and married there. Our kids and grandchildren all live in the magnificent area of the Laurentians, which is still home to all of my brothers and sisters no matter where they may live in the world. BRICE HALL Illustrator Summers in the Beaches provided my fondest memories of Toronto. My mother's stories of growing up in the lake-front neighbourhood in the east end were my earliest windows into the city, as we lived in London, Ont. Her family home was an old two-storey house her father had purchased after returning from the Second World War. I only came to know it in any meaningful way in my mid-teens when the death of our grandmother permitted us to visit more often. In addition to better getting to know our grandfather, I was now independent enough to explore the city on my own. I never ventured far, preferring to walk along Queen Street, the main drag, or perhaps the boardwalk that runs along the lake, and east as far as the Beacher Café, my grandfather's preferred restaurant. It was while exploring that I'd dream of what life would be like in the city, of moving to Toronto to become an illustrator, possibly working for a national newspaper. It had been five years since I'd visited the area, not since my grandfather moved to a nursing home (he passed away in 2013). Whereas the Beaches was once the place where I looked forward, I was returning to reflect, on this occasion to draw key landmarks, of which I expected little to have changed beyond the renovations to my mother's old home under its new owners. Nowadays I have no reason to come this way as its location puts it outside my daily routines. Instead, the Beaches retains a mystical quality for me, serving as the origin of my mother's family and now a former place of family ritual, where I dreamt of the future and got my first independent taste of the city. With my life here now firmly established, it's telling of Toronto's frenetic pace that while I don't live far from the area - just a few subway stops and a bus ride away - the distance feels greater than it is. I think I prefer it that way, with my memory of the area preserved in its remoteness, like the past itself. TRU WILSON 13-year-old transgender activist This summer I'm most excited to go on a road trip on my family. We're going to visit my Nana and Grandad in Edmonton, and also my Grandma in Saskatchewan, and my uncle Stewart. We always went on road trips. I remember the first road trip, we stopped off at every train station I could find so I could look at the trains, and we also stopped off at a lot of trains where you could ride them. I like trains - my favourite was Thomas the Tank Engine. Big part of my childhood. Last summer was the first year where I got to babysit my younger siblings at home. It was nice because we didn't have to go to summer camp. We also went to a gender conference in Seattle, the Gender Odyssey Conference, which we go to every year. We also went to Comic-Con and got a membership at the EMP Museum. Museums are fun. With my neighbourhood friends, we always have a summer bucket list. Last year we got almost everything done, except for a couple things. We wanted to have a homemade slide, make a time capsule, make a fairy garden. What else? Oh - message in a bottle. And reorganize our rooms. We have a huge slumber party where we do a whole bunch of challenges: candy challenge, pizza challenge, blindfolded makeup challenge. We didn't do any of the dangerous ones though; we're not that adventurous. And we had a Harry Potter movie marathon. We haven't actually decided for this year yet. We're planning on having a huge slumber party so that we can plan the bucket list and everything. - As told to Maija Kappler ROB OLIPHANT Federal Liberal MP Canadian author Morley Torgov entitled his novel about growing up in Sault Ste. Marie A Good Place to Come From. I could not agree more. I grew up in the Soo (that moniker flows much more easily off my tongue than its full name) in the 1960s and 1970s. The Soo was a vibrant city, small enough to feel safe anywhere and to know people everywhere, but large enough to have a symphony orchestra, an often-winning Ontario Hockey League team and a conservatory of music. The St. Mary's River and its rapids not only gave the city its name but both its reason for being and its electricity. That source of power fostered steel, paper and lumber industries. In the Soo, we made things, things that people around the world needed and would use. It was the paper industry that brought my father, a professional forester, and mother, to the Soo in 1949. They came for a few years and stayed there for life. The north-south pull was as much to Michigan as to Toronto. When the ferry to Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. was replaced by the very modern International Bridge in 1962, crossing the border became an everyday possibility. For some reason, the food at The Antlers Restaurant on the American side seemed more exotic than the New Marconi on the Canadian side. But the New Marconi was great, an iconic restaurant with the best ribs in the world (according to my Dad) and homemade spumoni ice cream. Things Italian were the norm in the Soo, with a vibrant Italian-Canadian community having arrived in several waves after both the First and Second World Wars and beyond. It wasn't until I was in university that I found people who thought lasagna was a main course, not an appetizer. Of course, we were also one of the few houses in our neighbourhood with only one kitchen (upstairs), no cantina filled with tomato sauce and wine that came from the store. Skates and skis were attached to our feet at a very young age. Snow-shoes, however, were deemed a form of punishment. Everyone hoped to be the next Phil or Tony Esposito. No one could name a single person famous for snowshoeing. In the winter we were all Finns. I can still feel the crisp air against my face as I skied through the planted pines at Hiawatha Park. Finnish apple cake and a mysterious hot juice drink followed. Of course, it wasn't always winter in the Soo, just mostly. The arrival of smelts from nearby rivers and maple syrup from St. Joseph's Island marked the end of winter. Summers took us on annual treks north through the Canadian Shield to have our annual family picture taken in front of the huge Canada Goose in Wawa, explore the pictographs at Agawa Rock or take in the sheer beauty of Old Woman Bay on Lake Superior. Luckily we had lots of friends with camps at Batchewana and the North Channel. The water was warm enough to swim in at least a month of the year. STEVEN PINKER Harvard Professor, Author I felt like something of an Anglophile and that's stayed with me. I still like reading about the Queen. There was a picture of the Queen in my classroom and I thought she was the most beautiful person on earth. But at the same time I lived through the Centennial in 1967, which saw an upsurge of Canadian patriotism. That was a huge event in my life. Those few years were a great time to be a Canadian. It was the patriotic duty of every Canadian to have a project. Mine, with another student, was making a huge 3D map of Canada out of flour and water dough on a 4x8 piece of plywood. And of course, Expo67 was the Centennial project for Montreal. Expo67 was a huge part of my childhood. I took the Montreal Metro, which was a huge source of pride. I was there so many times that it'd be hard to single one out. One of them was watching the Habitat 67 being assembled cubicle by cubicle. And in a lovely coincidence, Moshe Safdie is now a personal friend and a colleague at Harvard. There were four thematic pavilions, all with man in the title - a reminder of the just post-Mad Men era - that were filled with scientific imagery and ethnographic video footage. My friends and I would go every weekend and every opportunity we could. - As told to David Rudin KELLEY ARMSTRONG Author I'm often asked if I grew up dreaming of being an author. I didn't, and that's because, while I was always writing, the authors I read weren't Canadian, and so I got the impression that you couldn't be a Canadian author writing the kinds of stories that interested me. I figured that meant I either had to write something different or move to the U.S., and I had no intention of doing either. Even today, if asked where else I'd love to live, my answers - Vancouver Island, the Yukon, Prince Edward Island - are all still within Canada. I'm not a winter person. For me, that's the season where I hibernate and write. Yet I still want a winter. Without the cold and the snow, I wouldn't get the annual anticipation of spring. And spring is the lead-in to the best season in Canada: summer. For me, summer means reading. As a child, it meant two months where I could read all I wanted. Oh, sure, my dad was always telling me to put down the book and go outside. I would obey half his instructions - taking my book outside to read in the sunshine. Or I'd get on my bike ... and ride to the library for more books. But there's only so much time one can devote to reading. That's when I really did get outdoors. Walking to the corner store for penny candy and ice cream. Exploring the fields and forests near our home. Joining our biannual trip to Nova Scotia to stay with my great-grandmother, which gave me fresh territory - and, yes, a fresh library - to explore. I always dreamed I'd have a cottage someday. I don't, but only because I discovered something better: an annual family trip renting a cottage someplace new. It's the annual question of ""where are we going this summer, Mom?"" And the answer is Canada. Always Canada. MÉLANIE JOLY Minister of Canadian Heritage In my most vivid summer memories, I must have been around 10 years old. My friends and I would go on long bicycle rides along the Rivière des Prairies on Montreal's northern shore and make a pit stop at the local ice cream shop to eat a soft vanilla and chocolate ice cream swirl. These days would blend right into my neighbourhood's barbeque season where families would gather leading up to Canada Day celebrations. This is exactly the essence we want to capture for the 150th celebrations - local, community-oriented, and a time to dream of the Canada of tomorrow. CASSIE CAMPBELL Hockey Broadcaster/ Olympian I grew up in Ontario, and when it got to summer my parents would ship my older brother and I to P.E.I. They would put us on a plane together and my Gram would meet us at the other end. We are two young kids, feeling pretty cool about being on a plane by yourself, but nervous at the same time, and then we'd land at Charlottetown airport and the first person we'd see was our Gram, smiling, waiting to hug us. She would take us to Hank's BBQ chicken and Mary's Bake Shoppe, and then to a little corner store where we would get a pop - in a glass bottle. Gram was originally a Montgomery and married into the Campbells, and so my dad grew up on a farm where Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of Anne of Green Gables, was married. My greatgreat grandfather was her uncle, so we're actually blood-related. My dad grew up poor, and so the farm stayed as is. They kept all the furniture. They kept everything, and it became the Anne of Green Gables Museum in Park Corner. My Gram ran it with my uncle George. As kids she would send us across the street - and it was the Atlantic Ocean. She'd say, ""Get to the Beach, get out of here."" We'd help cut the lawn at the farm, do chores and get spoiled by my grandmother. We'd have Campbell family picnics with three-legged races, potato-sack races and lobster boils. Summer will always be P.E.I. for me. I'd go there as a kid, and I go there every other summer now that I am married and have a child. - As told to Joe O'Connor Columnist Until I was 10 and bundled off to overnight summer camp, I spent whole summers in Balfour Beach, a 50-family community near Keswick on the south end of Lake Simcoe, a relatively short commute for fathers on Wednesday nights and weekends. Its handiness to Toronto was - is - arguably its most marketable feature. For it isn't an attractive site. I remember our tiny crescent-shaped communal beachfront continually attracting shallow-lake debris, and the grassy surround as marshy, downright squelchy after rain. From the adjacent lagoon, used as dockage for motorboats, a sheen of stinky oil would drift into the swimming area. But we had nothing to compare it against, and were happy. Our hamlet was named for Lord Balfour, whose famous ""declaration"" gave Britain's coveted imprimatur to the (re)establishment of a Jewish Homeland in Palestine, paving the way to Israel's statehood. Rose Dunkelman, wife of Tip Top Tailors founder David, and an ardent Zionist, bought the land to provide vacation cottages for Jews, whose presence was unwelcome elsewhere, and which may explain why our crummy allotment was the only largish tract available. Our cottage was half of a duplex bungalow, charmless but functional, and a bit of a hike to the beach, which was compensated for by its proximity, just across the entry road, to Camp Katonim (Hebrew for ""little ones""), where we spent weekdays. Camp Katonim was where I learned the usual skills, plus songs of social justice from our leftie counselors, but it was especially prized by our mothers, freeing them, apart from lunch duty, for the day. Fridays we took bagged lunch to camp, so the mothers could concentrate on preparing lavish Shabbat dinners to welcome our exhausted dads. Weekends the camp served parents, with Saturday night adult parties and Sunday morning fathers vs. counselors baseball (our dad pitching). My urban mother disliked the country, but my father's enthusiasm plus fear of the dreaded polio virus spread in cities trumped her boredom, which she soothed in ritual female socializing. Often I'd often arrive from camp to the delicate clicking of mah-jong tiles and a peppy flow of gossip. For beneath its apple-pie surface, there was a Mad Menesque vibe at Balfour. Our dads weren't martini-swilling Don Drapers. They were mostly workaholic small-business guys on the make, emulating the tiny cluster of wealthy Balfourites with private waterfronts and tennis courts. But some of our 1950s moms (not mine) had a certain demure Joan Draper friskiness to them. Those sultry weekends were awash in boozy parties and sexual dalliance, and once, enthrallingly for a Jewish girl, a jealousy fuelled fist fight. Our wealthiest Balfourite flaunted his affair with the first Jewish Miss America! But I learned all this later. My childish Balfour Beach was a Truman-Show like bubble. Within the confines of my beloved rural ghetto, I was safe, free to roam where I pleased and welcome everywhere. It was in Balfour Beach, I believe, that I acquired the habit of friendliness to the world. It was a very good experience. I learned how to use a chainsaw, and how physically demanding it is to work in the woods. FARAH MOHAMED Founder and CEO of G(irls)20 There is one thing that is defining about summer, at least for kids. It makes them smile. You think about being outside, being with your friends, family. You're playing and you're just freer, it seems. It immediately evokes for me this warm emotion. As I am speaking to you now, I wish you could see my smile. We grew up in St. Catharines, Ont. While my parents came from comfortable lifestyles in Uganda, when they came to Canada, they came with nothing. So finding things to do on weekends, you had to make sure things were affordable. Because we lived so close to Niagara Falls, my family and expanded family - cousins, parents, sister - we would all go off and do a picnic at Niagara Falls. I remember going up and down Lundy's Lane, going in and out of what we would consider now those slightly kitschy stores but being in awe of the big lights and moving parts, then going to the park just by Niagara Falls. My mom would always make some really great stuff. Samosas, sandwiches and fruit in our basket. My father would always sneak candy - always. We'd always get ice cream. We would play cards, run around the park, check out the Falls. You could stare at the Falls for hours. Stand out. There's the sheer sound as you get close; it is indescribable unless you hear it, the sheer velocity of Niagara Falls. The second thing is the feeling of the mist: it's magical. We went on the Maid of the Mist that goes under the Falls. I still have this crazy, not-very-attractive picture of us in what look like garbage bags coming out of the mist. I also have a (fake) picture of us in the barrel going over the Falls. When people come visit me, I take them to Niagara Falls. Where else can you find a wonder of the world that crosses two defined borders, something we share and something that no one can ever control? - As told to Douglas Quan REX MURPHY Columnist What I remember from my very early days in Carbonear, N.L., is more a series of images than a story. Summer - such as that word is understood in The Happy Province - meant more than release from school. It was mandatory open air time for all youngsters. Parents from those days had strong feelings about children ""staying in"" and cluttering up the house while the sun was shining. Even on those grey or fog-thick days when it was quite vividly not the case, the sun in Newfoundland being more frequently invoked than experienced. Summer in Newfoundland was and is more a concept than anything else. ""Out of the house,"" and ""make sure you're back before dark,"" were the stock parental formulations, and off you went, unless there was a prior injunction ""go to the store"" to pick up a bag of flour and some Fleischmann's yeast or any other of the stock items mothers, great bread makers all, were continually running out of. Or to buy a cod. I recall being sent to the town wharf opposite the post office quite early one morning, on what was grandly called Water Street, to pick up a fish or two. I was bankrolled with an entire dime, and whether that bought two fish - pronged up from the boat to me on the wharf - or one, I can't really recall. But I do or think I do recall the odour of the fish. And its size. Longer, or so recall deems, than I was tall, and certainly so heavy, for me (I was five), that its tail dragged on the gravel and dust of the dirt road home. Codfish and a Carbonear summer morning is not Proust and his biscuit, but the feel of the sun and the smell of the codfish from that day remain vivid. Then it was off to the barrens with a friend or two, over the hill from our house. They stretched all the way to Victoria (the N.L. village, not the B.C. Eden) at the ""back of Carbonear"" as everyone from those days phrased it. Picking a few early berries, or just idly meandering over the barrens, clustering around a clump of ill-nourished trees was all our purpose. Sometimes for such days we came prepared. Provisions were a bag containing two or three bologna sandwiches, some soft drink to wash them down and on the more opulent outings a tin of York Wieners and Beans. Now there was a madeleine - the taste of York eaten on a day in the woods or on the barrens lingers imperishably. My more capable friends now and then brought matches (Eddy's) slyly gathered from their homes, and were possessed with the urge to start a fire - not from need, it wasn't cold - but because it was fun. Feeble and clumsy efforts usually got a smouldering, timid half-blaze going, at which we stared for a while and then ""douted"" with cans of water from some sludgy pit, or stomped out by the bunch of us. Other days it was in the Valley Road until the town ran out and we were in the woods at Melton's Bridge, which covered a stream that pooled a few hundred yards or so from the road. There the more confident and coordinated - I was not either - stripped and went in for a swim. That's also where they had learned to swim - no adult present for these bold (and risky) efforts - the braver just diving off a rock into the pool, hoping for the best, and somehow over a few days picking up how to swim. Melton's Bridge was our ""rec centre"" and on the truly hot days as many as 30 or 40 kids ringed the tiny pool, popping in and out of it as the spirit or the sunshine prompted them. The other expedition was just minutes from the house, going down to the beach for the capelin days, with a pail and a hammer. Hammers are not fishing rods, but the capelin beaching were so numerous, a rolling, roiling mass, probably in the millions over the full length of the beach, that the hammer claw would grab three, four, five or six at a lunge. Then it was bring the capelin home, where they were promptly thrown on the dampers of the wood stove for the few minutes needed to cook them and then, head and all, save for the tail, they were eaten. Almost every day of those summers was a children-only world from the time you left the house, till at 6 or 7 o'clock, and sometimes even later, you returned home. That is probably the greatest change over the years - children went with children for the live-long day - no adult to guard or pester them, all spontaneous fun and wandering. The pure and rich idleness of kids filling their time every school-free day till September loomed, and the innocent dread of going back to school put a chill in the mind as each passing day brought that gloom ever closer. School was back with the adults - priests, nuns, parents and neighbours - and ""get out of the house and play"" was retired till the next year. DAVID SAINTJACQUES Canada's Next Astronaut St-Lambert is a small, small suburb of Montreal - a very old suburb, kind of developed before the days of automobiles. My life was very simple out there. I could walk to school, and all my friends lived on my street. It's one of those little towns where you can walk to the grocery store, the bookstore, the toy store - you can walk everywhere. My little world was all-accessible. My parents were academics, and they were big travelers. Most of my summer holidays and a couple of years in my youth, I spent abroad. With the excuse of a conference somewhere around the world that would pay for my dad's ticket, we would pack the family and go on a trip. We camped all the time. Sometimes, I joke that I grew up in a camping car - one of those Volkswagen vans. I don't know collectively how much time I spent living in those, but it's got to be years. I learned the basics of camping and outdoor survival right there, putting up the family tent every day for months and months, year after year. I think all that kind of formed a spirit of exploration, and made it normal for me. In the winter, we rented a house near a mountain east of Montreal. I learned to ski there. Some of my first experiences of outdoor adventure were when I was about 10, when my father started to take me on backcountry day trips in the forest, behind the ski resort. It made a very strong impression on me, going with my father and his friends. They were knee-deep in snow - I was probably chest-deep in snow, just there, in the wild. Exploring the forest was a very, very strong feeling of freedom. I was fortunate to have all these experiences of traveling with my parents, spending years abroad. But if you want to explore, you need a base. My hometown for me has been my base. I'd come back from three months of adventure, traveling, living in this camping car, but there's a ""Phew!"" moment coming back home - the familiar smell, the solidity of the house, you know how everything works. To this day, my parents live in the same neighbourhood. When I go visit them, I go jogging in the morning around what used to be my childhood universe. - As told to Nick Faris KENT HEHR Minister for Veterans Affairs A few weeks ago I went back to Hussar, Alta., where I spent five years of my youth. We visited just a day prior to Father's Day, and my father and I were able to walk through the parade with friends and family. My father was the school principal for the town and we were able to visit my old school for its final graduation celebration before it closes later this year. It was in Hussar where I put on skates for the first time (at age three) and also gave little britches' rodeo a shot. The former became a lifelong passion for me: the latter, not as much. Hockey forms at least one part of the lifeblood of our nation: I know it helped create the person who I am today, and it is our national sport. McGill University Astrophysicist I was a big hockey fan growing up. Living in Montreal, my favourite team was, of course, the Montreal Canadiens. I watched every televised game, and if one was not televised, I listened on the rad"
Once-bountiful fishery collapses as oil leak persists in Newfoundland bay,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ The oil has been seeping for about three years _ sometimes in drops, sometimes leaving large slicks _ fouling a scenic area in western Newfoundland once known for its scallop fishing. Concerned residents near Shoal Point in Port au Port Bay have tried everything from news releases to photos and video of the bubbling leak from an abandoned exploration well, trying to spur a permanent fix. ""If there was a leak in St. John's harbour, the coast guard would probably jump on it within hours,'' said Bob Diamond of the Port au Port Bay Fishery Committee. ""We don't really know the impact it's having. But we know that oil and water and fish and tourism don't mix.'' What is certain is that the scallop fishery, a once crucial economic driver in the area, has collapsed over the last three years, he said in an interview. ""We're speculating that it could be as the result of a number of factors: from oil polluting the environment to climate change to acidification of the waters. ""This is a man-made leak,'' Diamond said of the well, one of at least 12 abandoned exploration sites in the region that could date to the 1960s or as far back as the 1800s. Oversight and remediation must be stepped up, he added. Provincial Environment Minister Perry Trimper now says he's seeking expert advice to deal with the issue. He was not available for an interview Thursday, but confirmed in a statement that his department recently documented minimal seeping along with the smell of oil at Shoal Point. Despite efforts last fall to cap the well pipes in an area known for fishing and tourism, Trimper said amounts seeping in May were ""one drop at a time.'' An official who visited again July 8 ""did not see any free oil but did notice an oil odour,'' the minister said. ""The department intends to seek expertise to help determine what options are available to the government of Newfoundland and Labrador in order to manage the situation.'' No timeline was offered. A spokeswoman for Trimper also confirmed the province spent $263,000 last year on ""a temporary attempt to control oil leakages.'' An assessment last August by environmental consultant Amec Foster Wheeler _ prior to the remediation work last fall _ estimated about one litre an hour was seeping. ""Presently and based on the last two departmental inspections, the seepage rate was much less and we continue to look at available options to manage the situation and determine necessary actions,'' Chrysta Collins said in a statement. Diamond said the fishery committee photographed significant sheens still escaping from one of the repaired pipes in May, while a second pipe that had been capped in November appeared to be gone. ""The second pipe apparently had been severed due to ice movement and/or tidal and weather conditions during the winter months,'' says a committee update released earlier this month. There have been natural leaks from oil deposits in the region, but Diamond stressed this problem is a ""man-made'' issue. The fishery committee is urging more research to examine the cause of decimated scallop stocks and pollution risks to the broader marine ecosystem. It wants more regulatory oversight and public consultation before future oil and gas exploration is approved. And it wants Ottawa and the province to more clearly outline which agencies are responsible for cleaning up oil leaks and abandoned sites. A long-term fix is way overdue, Diamond said. ""We'd like to see an inventory done of the sites, where they are, what kind of condition they're in and remedial action to fix any leaks that are occurring.'' Follow ?suebailey on Twitter."

Military commanders launched a review of the practice several months ago, following revelations Canadian soldiers working with Kurdish peshmerga forces have been wearing the flag since 2014. In particular, experts worried that wearing the Kurdish flag instead of Iraqi flag could be seen as lending legitimacy to Kurdish independence in Iraq. But a Defence Department spokesman said this week that the decision was taken to keep the Kurdish flags to ""enhance cohesion'' with the peshmerga ""and to ensure easy visual identification, which contributes to force protection.'' 500 words.

"Toronto, Vancouver bring in booming hotel business as oil provinces struggle; Cities in Alberta, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan are seeing dwindling hotel demand",NL,"Hotels across the country are experiencing record-high occupancy rates and increased demand, leading to steeper room prices in many Canadian cities. Hotels in the downtown areas of Vancouver and Toronto are the most expensive spots to stay in, and hoteliers are seeing the biggest jump in revenue per room this year, says Brian Stanford, senior managing director at CBRE, a consultant that monitors the hotel industry. It’s not just a tourism boom in the country, propelled significantly by the faltering loonie, that has contributed to rising hotel costs. “The low loonie has certainly helped and has increased U.S. visitation and international travel, as those numbers are growing very strongly,” said Mr. Stanford. “But at the end of the day, it’s really been the resurgence in corporate demand in those markets.” According to CBRE, occupancy rates are on pace to increase in Vancouver to 78 per cent this year, up from 76 per cent last year, and in Toronto to 73 per cent from 71 last year. Hotels in Vancouver will also make 10-per-cent more revenue per room this year, with an average daily room rate of $175, $12 more than 2015. In Toronto, the average daily room rate is expected to hit $154, $6 more than last year, with hotels making eight-per-cent more revenue per room. However, not all areas of the country are reaping the benefits of a tourism boom, low loonie and increased corporate demand. Cities in resource-based provinces such as Alberta, Newfoundland and Saskatchewan are seeing dwindling hotel demand, thanks largely to plunging oil prices and the resulting economic recession. Mr. Stanford said 2015 was a particularly tough year for the hotel industry in those provinces, with the exception of tourist destinations such as Banff. The results are further exacerbated by the fact that during the oil boom, cities like Calgary and Edmonton increased supply by building several new hotels that have recently opened for business. According to Mr. Stanford, supply increased in Calgary by more than 10 per cent, and in Edmonton by 8 per cent. Meanwhile, demand has plummeted, so revenues in Calgary and Edmonton as of May were down 24 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, from the same time last year. “They were having good times for so many years, everyone decided to build,” said Monique Rosszell, the managing director of consulting at HVS. “But now they have a decrease in demand and a lot more rooms in the market, which always puts downward pressure because there are more rooms available.” A search for hotels on Expedia.ca shows the stark difference between markets across the country. For Saturday, Aug. 20, the average cost of a hotel room on Expedia.ca in downtown Toronto was $265 (with hotels being 65-per-cent booked just over three weeks in advance). The average cost of a room in downtown Vancouver on the same night came in at $492 (70-per-cent booked). Ms. Rosszell says in Toronto it’s the luxury hotels that have led the way in raising hotel prices. “Five-star hotels are ramping up and pushing rates. They’ve created a whole new tier of quality hotels, which means the four-star hotels – the Hiltons, the Marriots, the Westins – are able to push their rates up as they are no longer the market leaders,” said Ms. Rosszell. Meanwhile in Alberta, the average cost of a room on Expedia.ca in downtown Calgary is $120 (55 per cent booked) and in Edmonton $116 (40 per cent booked). However, Alberta’s destination towns are thriving, thanks largely in part to the low loonie. In Banff, the average cost of a hotel room for that evening was $385 (90-per-cent booked). Jessica Conant, vice-president of revenue management for Marriott Hotels Canada, says she first saw demand grow in February, when Toronto played host to the NBA all-star game. Since then, demand growth has been consistent. Although oil-producing provinces have been performing poorly, Ms. Conant says other markets are so strong that they are driving industry performance. Ms. Conant says Marriott Hotels has launched marketing campaigns selling Canada as an ideal travel destination to the company’s reward program clients. “I can think of five people from the U.S. who told me in the past week they are going to Canada for a vacation,” Ms. Conant said. “Lots of people are finding it an attractive option, and it’s a great value.” Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/toronto-vancouver-bring-in-booming-hotel-business-as-oil-provinces-struggle/article31215568/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/toronto-vancouver-bring-in-booming-hotel-business-as-oil-provinces-struggle/article31215568/] The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.

Capital’s hotel sector goes from strength to strength,NL,"EDINBURGH’S hotel sector enjoyed a year-on-year surge in room rates in June, and occupancy rose to more than 93 per cent, apparently driven by increased numbers of overseas tourists. The strong trading for Edinburgh hotels is revealed in the latest monthly survey of the sector from LJ Research, published today. The survey shows Glasgow hotels experienced a year-on-year drop in overall occupancy in June, to 85.9 per cent from 92.7 per cent in the same month of last year. This may reflect, at least in part, a rise in hotel capacity in Glasgow. The average room rate achieved by Glasgow hotels in June, at £80.03, was down only 0.7 per cent on the same month of last year. Aberdeen hotels achieved a modest year-on-year rise in occupancy but their average room rate in June was sharply lower than in the same month of 2015 as the oil and gas sector’s woes continued to weigh. Overall hotel occupancy in Edinburgh in June was 93.3 per cent, up from 90.9 per cent in the same month of last year. The average room rate in June for Edinburgh hotels was up by 10.8 per cent on the same month of last year at £125.69. This was the highest room rate achieved by the Edinburgh hotel sector in any June since LJ began recording it in 2005. Edinburgh’s hotel sector enjoyed a 13.8 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue per available room, a key measure of performance, to £117.28 in June. This revpar measure is calculated by multiplying occupancy by average room rate. Asked about the reasons for the Edinburgh hotel sector’s strong performance in June, Thomas Mathar, research manager at LJ, replied: “We only have anecdotal evidence from hoteliers we have spoken with. It seems to be the leisure market is doing particularly well, especially towards the end of the month. When you correlate the June findings with the airport statistics, you will find that inbound traffic into the destination was very high in June.” He added: “Those two things, combined, suggest it is the leisure market in particular, so overseas tourists coming into the city, that are driving that performance.” Asked about the possible future impact of the pound’s tumble in the wake of the UK electorate’s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union on the Edinburgh hotel sector, Mr Mathar replied: “Edinburgh’s market [composition] is broadly half of all visitors are domestic, half are international. “When sterling falls against the euro, that would quite potentially drive both types of visitors, domestic and international visitors, to come into the [city]. UK folk will find it more expensive to go abroad. EU travellers will find the UK cheaper. It may very well be that this is further going to bolster local performance. At this stage, it is all speculation. There is no hard evidence.” Mr Mathar noted that the hotel market in Glasgow might see a broadly similar effect from sterling weakness as that in Edinburgh. In spite of a 2.4 per cent year-on-year rise in occupancy at Aberdeen hotels in June, average room rate, at £67.42, was down by 21.9 per cent on the same month of 2015. Revpar for Aberdeen hotels in June was down by 20 per cent on the same month of last year at £47.71. Revpar for Glasgow hotels in June was down by 8.3 per cent on the same month of last year, the survey shows. Sean Morgan, managing director at Edinburgh-based LJ Research said: “June saw another month of contrasting fortunes for hoteliers in Scotland’s largest cities. The frontrunner this month was Edinburgh, which recorded remarkable double-digit [percentage] room rate growth. Savvy revenue management by hotels and the impact of a diverse range of events helped to affect the strong performance. “For the second consecutive month in Glasgow, year-on-year reductions in both indicators – occupancy and, to a lesser extent, room rate – [were] recorded. Revpar, as a result, fell again by over five per cent compared to 2015. Whilst the last few months’ performance highlights challenges in the market, hotels in Glasgow continue to achieve notably higher revpar compared to two years ago – pre the Commonwealth Games.” LJ said, over the first six months of 2016, the Edinburgh hotel market appeared to have been “buoyant and growing”. It observed that, more than offsetting a 1.6 per cent year-on-year reduction in average occupancy in the January to June period, hoteliers recorded a 7.2 per cent rise in average room rate. LJ added that, in Glasgow, a 2.8 per cent year-on-year fall in occupancy in the opening six months of 2016 had outstripped a 1.8 per cent increase in average room rate. However, it noted occupancy in Glasgow over the six months was 78 per cent, compared with Edinburgh’s 77 per cent."
Inuit fear they will be overwhelmed as ‘extinction tourism’ descends on Arctic,NL,"Visit of giant cruise ship will bring money and tourists to the Northwest Passage, but fears grow for the area’s people and its ecosystem In a few days, one of the world’s largest cruise ships, the Crystal Serenity, will visit the tiny Inuit village of Ulukhaktok in northern Canada. Hundreds of passengers will be ferried to the little community, more than doubling its population of around 400. The Serenity will then raise anchor and head through the Northwest Passage[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises] to visit several more Inuit settlements before sailing to Greenland and finally New York. It will be a massive undertaking, representing an almost tenfold increase in passenger numbers  taken through the Arctic on a single vessel [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard] – and it has triggered considerable controversy[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/30/my-arctic-journey-fragile-ecosystem-northwest-passage] among Arctic experts. Inuit leaders fear that visits by giant cruise ships could overwhelm fragile communities, while others warn that the Arctic ecosystem, already suffering the effects of global warming, could be seriously damaged. “This is extinction tourism,” said international law expert Professor Michael Byers, of the University of British Columbia. “Making this trip has only become possible because carbon emissions have so warmed the atmosphere that Arctic sea ice in summer is disappearing. The terrible irony is that this ship – which even has a helicopter for sightseeing and a huge staff-to-passenger ratio – has an enormous carbon footprint that is only going to make things even worse in the Arctic.” The Serenity is by far the biggest cruise vessel to traverse the fabled Northwest Passage, whose exploration has claimed the lives of hundreds of seamen. The ship has a crew of 655 and carries 1,070 passengers, who have paid between £19,000 and £120,000 for a voyage that Crystal Cruises says will take them on an “intrepid adventure” from Anchorage in Alaska to New York over 32 days. For its part, Crystal insists its clients will have to follow a strict code of conduct during shore visits, while the ship’s air, water and rubbish discharges will be tightly controlled. Only low-sulphur fuel will be burned in the Serenity’s engines, said a spokesman. The Serenity will be accompanied by the UK icebreaker the RSS Ernest Shackleton, he added. However, it is not the voyage that directly poses danger, Byers said. “This is a well-supported, carefully worked-out trip. I acknowledge that. The trouble is that it is going to open the door to mass tourism in the high Arctic and many other operators – who could easily turn out to be far less scrupulous or painstaking – will be eyeing it up for major operations. That could end in disaster. ” Related: Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams] This point was backed by Okalik Eegeesiak, chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. “Far too many people will be descending suddenly into these communities and bringing far too much garbage with them,” she told the Observer. “These places lack the infrastructure and the training to deal with the incredible numbers of people that will start arriving on these boats.” Apart from Ulukhaktok, the Serenity is also scheduled to visit the Inuit communities of Pond Inlet, Cambridge Bay and Sisimiut. Eegeesiak added that the Inuit were already experiencing problems thanks to global warming. As sea ice disappears, this removes a highway on which locals can ride their snowmobiles and dog sleds to hunt and visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of communities and limits the ability of people to hunt, a problem that is only likely to worsen as the region’s shrinking ice-cap opens it up to mining, oil drilling, tourism and more shipping. In addition, there is the question of food. The Inuit have no farms and rely on what they can catch from the ice and water around them for sustenance. But this food chain is under threat. Algae grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals and finally polar bears. However, if the bottom rung of this food chain disappears because sea ice is melting, then all sorts of unintended consequences could soon be realised, marine biologists have warned. Mass tourism is only going to make this worse, they add. This point was stressed by Eegeesiak. “It is not just the communities we need to worry about when these great boats arrive but all the wildlife of the region,” she said. Earlier this month Crystal announced that it was already taking bookings for a similar 32-day cruise through the Northwest Passage for 2017. In addition, it revealed it has ordered construction of “the world’s first purpose-built polar class megayacht, the Crystal Endeavour”. The ship – which will cruise exclusively in the Arctic and Antarctic – will carry underwater scooters to allow passengers to experience their own subsea exploration and will be fitted with some of the largest bedroom suites ever put in a cruise ship. “This megayacht will change the game entirely – the possibilities for expedition travellers will be virtually limitless,” said Crystal president Edie Rodriguez. But such an opening up of the Arctic to tourism dismays Byers. “One big ship is perhaps manageable but five or six is tempting disaster. Glaciers are crumbling more and more up there and we are getting more and more icebergs in the water. “If a ship carrying 3,000 passengers hits one of those you could be in real trouble. This is an incredibly remote region. It could take two days to get search-and-rescue helicopters up there. Yet an accident like that is almost inevitable.”"
"Please forgive me, and slap me with a cod",NL,"I once called the province a ‘vast and scenic welfare ghetto.' I couldn't have been more wrong Aubrey Payne is a stumpy guy with a weather-beaten face and hands like horn. He has a thousand stories. Once he was out fishing with his wife, Marie, and fell into the frigid North Atlantic. “I thought I was a goner,"" he says. She fashioned two lassos with rope and hauled him into the boat, saving his life. Aubrey, one of 14 kids, grew up on Fogo Island. The whole economy relied on fish. Then the longliners and factory trawlers came along and scooped up all the cod, and the fishery shut down. Fogo went on welfare. The kids left. Today, Aubrey and Marie are back fishing. They take rich tourists out to catch cod the old-fashioned way, one at a time. Their customers come from the Fogo Island Inn, where rooms go for $1,700 a night and up. Ever since Gwyneth Paltrow stayed there and gushed about it on Instagram, the inn has been sold out. Suddenly Newfoundland is hot. It has been discovered by the jaded global cognoscenti who've seen everything and been everywhere. It offers exactly what they want: novelty, rugged beauty, authenticity and bragging rights. Even the food is pretty good. You can still get fried baloney pretty much anywhere. But you can also get personally foraged sea-urchin roe, collected on the spot and served on a rock by the ocean. “North America's most unlikely culinary capital"" blared The Telegraph of London, which raved about the sustainability of it all. Last month, we went to Newfoundland with some friends. I was a little worried about my welcome. Back in the Danny Williams days, when the province went to war with Ottawa over oil royalties, I'd written a snarky column that described the province as a “vast and scenic welfare ghetto"" populated by ingrates on pogey. Newfoundlanders took offence. I was deluged with thousands of e-mails from folks who wanted to boil me in seal oil. “You're as ignorant as my grandmother's arse,"" went one of the milder ones. Newfoundlanders, I have learned, never forget. They still remember the forced resettlement of the outports as if it happened yesterday. So I decided to travel under my married name, Peggy McLeod. Secretly, my friends called our trip the Margaret Wente Truth and Reconciliation Tour. We wanted to visit Fogo, but the Fogo Island Inn was a bit above our price point, and also full. So was every other place. We finally found a house called Nan's, in the town of Little Seldom, on a street called Penney Lane. Our landlady was Joan Penney, who is Marie's sister, and that's how we wound up having dinner with Aubrey, Marie, Joan and her husband Max. “Aren't you some kind of celebrity?"" Aubrey asked suspiciously when we met. It turned out he was referring to my husband, who sounds like someone on Stuart McLean's radio show. Over scallops and beer, they treated us to tales of their early life: five kids to a bedroom, hauling water from the well, eating seal to get them through the winter. Their conversation was salty and wonderfully accented. They dropped and added “h""s and didn't bother with ""th"" at all. Aubrey told us about the job he had as a kid, lighting the fires in the morning at the merchant's house on the hill. “I remember dem all in deir beds, all huddled up in deir noightcaps,"" he recalled. I felt like I was in a Dickens novel. Aubrey can do anything: build a boat or house, fix a motor, dodge a whale or iceberg. So can Marie. She has a fishing licence too. Someone once told her at a meeting that women don't belong in the fishery. “How do you know I'm a woman?"" she shot back. “Have we ever been in bed together?"" Today, Aubrey is on the planning committee for Fogo, where he works with the inn's owners to figure out a sustainable future for the island. (The inn was built by Zita Cobb, the daughter of an illiterate Fogo fisherman, who went away to study business, joined a fledgling high-tech company, became CFO and cashed in for $69-million, a good chunk of which she has plowed back into Fogo.) They are building a business selling artisanal hand-caught cod to fussy upscale Toronto chefs. Last fall, Aubrey went to Shanghai to close a deal to sell sea cucumber to the Chinese. (It's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.) “Those Baymen,"" someone said to me one day. “They can build a tin arse into a cat."" That certainly applies to Aubrey. Next to resourceful Newfoundlanders like him and Marie, effete bigcity types like me are useless. I got them wrong, and I'm sorry. I've even bought a sealskin hat, which I intend to wear on Bloor Street when the winter comes. I don't care what people say. It's a sign of solidarity. Besides, it's warm."
"Premier Dwight Ball paints dire picture of Newfoundland’s economic future; If a number of things go right, the government doesn’t anticipate the province’s books being balanced for seven years",NL,"ST. JOHN’S -- It wasn’t long ago that Newfoundland and Labrador seemed to be swimming in oil dollars. But Premier Dwight Ball says that wealth and opportunity was squandered, and now a province known for enduring tough financial times sits on the precipice of economic shambles. The list of Newfoundland’s woes is extensive, starting with an unemployment rate hovering near 14 per cent – twice the national average – that is expected to climb to nearly 20 per cent in the next few years. Debt, meantime, is piling up at a record rate; Mr. Ball’s Liberal government is expecting to finish this fiscal year with a deficit of $1.4-billion, according to a recent economic update. The government doesn’t anticipate the province’s books being balanced for seven years – that is, if a number of things go right. By then, the mountain of red ink will exceed $17-billion by the government’s estimate – and much, much higher in the view of others. Debt-servicing costs, meantime, are set to rise by 55 per cent by 2022. With a population that is aging and shrinking at the same time, some analysts have raised the spectre of bankruptcy. Complicating matters is the fact that three major infrastructure projects – including the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric facility – are winding down or will soon be doing so. They represent 10,000 jobs. Muskrat has been a financial disaster and will come in at about $11-billion, or almost twice the projected amount. “There is a sense of urgency in terms of where we are as a province and where we need to go,” Mr. Ball told The Globe and Mail in an interview at his legislative office. “All the drop in oil did was expose a problem that has been perpetuating for the last 12 years and that is spending levels in this province that have just grown and grown with no one preparing for the day oil would not be around, or would not have much impact. Well, that day has arrived.” While the impact that the oil crash has had on Alberta has received most of the country’s attention, it has hit Newfoundland’s treasury much harder. Five years ago, revenue from the oil industry was nearly $3-billion annually. In fiscal 2015-16, royalties are expected to be in the neighbourhood of $550-million. Today, Mr. Ball says the province derives more money from fees and fines than it does from offshore royalties. The oil collapse has also meant there are far fewer jobs in Fort McMurray, Alta., where Newfoundlanders have commuted back and forth for decades, making a handsome living in the oil sands. And the worst is yet to come. The Unemployment Insurance that thousands of these workers went on late last year when they lost their jobs in Fort Mac and in Newfoundland is about to run out. From May, 2015, to May, 2016, there was a 52.9-per-cent increase in personal insolvencies in the province, according to the federal Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy. During the height of oil’s boom years in the late 2000s, Newfoundland became a “have” province after decades of being a regular recipient of federal handouts. But at a time when the province could use transfer dollars more than ever, it is obligated to live with an arrangement that prevents it from renegotiating the terms of equalization until 2018. This mess is now Mr. Ball’s to handle. It has not been an easy first 10 months in office, with a spring budget that dramatically raised taxes and fees, making him one of the most unpopular premiers in the country. There would appear to be few decisions in his future that will help turn his dismal approval ratings around. What angers him, he says, is utter disregard that successive Conservative administrations – including Danny Williams’s – showed for the future of the province. During a 12-year stretch of Tory rule, Mr. Ball said, the province brought in nearly $20-billion from money provided by oil royalties and federal contributions. “We had more money than at any point in our history, but we were also borrowing more money than we ever did before,” said Mr. Ball. “How does this happen? So, yeah, I get upset when people had a lot of money, especially when it’s connected to a commodity, and you don’t have the foresight to plan for a dropoff in prices, because you know it’s going to happen.” Instead of paying down debt during the good years, billions were spent on infrastructure and tax cuts. “Today, oil would have to be at $148 [U.S.] a barrel to fix our budget problems,” the Premier said. “I don’t believe it’s going there any time soon so every dollar below $148 a barrel is my challenge to deal with.” In a recent brainstorming session with 150 invited guests from across sectors of Newfoundland’s economy, Mr. Ball laid out some of the grim decisions that await the province, including dramatically slashing the costs of delivering services – costs that are, on a per-capita basis, more than anywhere else in the country. There are, however, some glimmers of hope. The price of oil has begun inching upward and now sits regularly above $50 a barrel. Tourism is up, thanks to an especially captivating national ad campaign that plays up the beauty and charm of the province. The groundfish fishery is on the verge of a rebound. The Bank of Montreal is calling for 0.7-per-cent growth next year – which is better than earlier forecasts. Mr. Ball says that while all of the options he has to remedy the province’s dire financial situation are difficult, he’s determined to take them. “People may not like my choices,” Mr. Ball said. “But people can’t argue about me not making them. We really have no alternative at this point. None at all.” Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/premier-dwight-ball-paints-dire-picture-of-newfoundlands-economic-future/article32671914/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/premier-dwight-ball-paints-dire-picture-of-newfoundlands-economic-future/article32671914/] Globe and Mail Update"
A $750K question: Can a subsea tunnel link Newfoundland with Labrador?,NL,"ST. JOHN'S, N.L. _ Could a subsea tunnel under the Strait of Belle Isle finally link northern Newfoundland with Labrador? It's a question that for decades has inspired dreams of free-flowing trade, hundreds of jobs and thousands of tourists. Proponents say a fixed link _ like the Chunnel between the U.K. and France, or the North Cape Tunnel in Norway _ would unleash economic opportunity. ""It could, theoretically, be a game changer,'' said Des Whalen, chairman of the St. John's Board of Trade. But the idea is making political waves in the cash-strapped province, as critics lambaste plans to spend up to $750,000 for another feasibility report. ""At a time when funding is being slashed all over the place for important programs, I really question the wisdom of spending three quarters of a million dollars,'' NDP Leader Earle McCurdy said in an interview. ""Even if the study comes back and says, yes, this is feasible, we're not in a financial position to do the project any time soon.'' The tunnel under the strait, which is roughly 17 kilometres at its most narrow point, would connect about 26,000 residents of the mainland with the island of Newfoundland. But McCurdy and other doubters stress the province is in the midst of a fiscal crisis since oil prices collapsed. Despite spending cuts and tax hikes, a $1.6 billion deficit is forecast this year as net debt mounts. That's on top of soaring costs linked to the Muskrat Falls hydro project now under construction in Labrador. Its estimated price tag has hit $11.4 billion, up $4 billion from four years ago. The Liberal government says it earmarked $750,000 for the Labrador link study in its last budget as part of economic diversity efforts, but none of it has been spent so far. Progressive Conservative member Barry Petten says a study commissioned more than 12 years ago by the previous Tory regime already recommended a single-lane tunnel that would move vehicles one way at a time on an ""electric train shuttle.'' But with an estimated cost of $1.7 billion with financing -- and 11 years for development -- the project stalled. It never progressed despite years of hefty surplus budgets flush with offshore oil revenues. ""People wanted to make this work in 2004 and 2005,'' Petten said in an interview. ""At the end of the day, they just couldn't make it feasible. I don't see what has changed now.'' People familiar with the study led by former engineering consulting firm Hatch Mott MacDonald are baffled by the latest move to revisit it, he added. ""They were a bit astounded why you're going to spend $750,000 in this financial climate on a study that has really already been completed but just needs minor updates.'' Businessman Danny Dumaresque, a former provincial Liberal Party president, said that research is outdated and never examined a proper business case. He has been a vocal backer of the Labrador tunnel concept for years. As with the Confederation Bridge in P.E.I., Dumaresque believes private investors could be found to finance a venture that would eliminate escalating ferry costs while generating big profits over time _ at no public cost. ""This is nonsense to think we can't do it.'' Whalen said Board of Trade members have followed related debates with interest. ""There's a lot of transportation infrastructure in the country right now being built through public-private partnerships,'' he said in an interview. ""It creates opportunities for jobs. ""If it can be done properly and cost effectively, this province has a great need for infrastructure.'' Still, Whalen said an in-depth cost-benefit analysis is needed, along with a review of regional highways in northern Newfoundland and southern Labrador into Quebec. Follow ?suebailey on Twitter."
