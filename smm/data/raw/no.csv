ARTISTS TAKE OVER BALTIC SEA DISCUSSION,Norway,"TALLINN - The Baltic Sea is one of the most fascinating areas in the world, along with its rich history. The Baltic Sea area has always been of great importance to the people living around it, providing a natural bond as well as route for navigation. Fisheries remain a valuable part of people’s livelihood today and the Baltic Sea area is also a recreational resource of growing value. Because of the very specific hydrographical, chemical and physical conditions of the Sea area, and its geological history, it possesses quite unusual fauna and flora. Marine and freshwater organisms live side by side, and there is a number of living relicts. The exchange of water in the Baltic Sea is very slow, and if harmful substances are introduced, they will remain there for a very long time. As the fauna and flora of the Baltic Sea area are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, there should be no discharges of harmful substances, especially oil and noxious liquid substances, into this vulnerable sea. However, the Baltic Sea is often said to be the world’s most polluted sea. The health of this body of water has been seriously damaged since the 1960s due to excessive pollution from the countries in its catchment area. The pollution, such as untreated human waste, toxic materials, and metal, has resulted in the Sea’s stratification. This process of stratification has left certain layers of the Baltic mostly freshwater, while rendering other layers saltwater. The Baltic Sea, when it is stable, is a mix of freshwater from the rivers of Europe, and saltwater from the North Sea which flows in through the straits around Denmark. According to experts, the source of much of the pollution was, and still is, from the countries of the former Soviet Union and East Bloc. This pollution, in turn, harms a variety of other industries, including fishing and tourism. Because of unrestricted and (environmentally) unregulated industry, factory waste was disposed directly into the Baltic Sea or into rivers which fed the Baltic. Experts claim that another reason why the Baltic has reached this critical situation is agricultural run-off, all from Western European countries. These chemicals run off the farmland and into the water supply, eventually ending up in the Baltic Sea. With the fall of the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe the issue is now to move towards a collective plan to clean up the Baltic. Many positive steps are being taken by the countries which either border the Sea, or are in its catchment area. The most significant of these steps is the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environment Action Program, which was agreed on and approved by the Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of the Environment in Helsinki, Finland in April 1992. The countries directly effected are the nine which line the Baltic coast: Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Poland, Germany, and Denmark. The catchment area includes Norway, Belarus, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic. Experts say that the Baltic Sea’s rich biodiversity is threatened by environmental pollution that could cause irreversible damage to a sea that is an important source of economic and recreation for more than 80 million people who live along its coast and within its catchment area. The sea is very important to the tourism and fishing industries of the Baltic countries. Species of fish, such as herring, sprat, and cod, are affected by pollution from urban areas, industries, and agriculture (fertilizers). The goal of the Baltic nations is to reduce the amount of pollution which reaches the Baltic Sea in order to preserve the precious fishing and tourism trade in each country. Steps to clean up the Baltic have been made possible with the end of the East-West divide. The 14 countries of the catchment area are now on schedule to carry out a comprehensive program to improve the environment in and around the Baltic Sea. Juuka Jormola, a scientist from the Finnish Environment Institute, says “Pollution of the Baltic Sea is caused by nutrients, too many nutrients in the water, like nitrogen and phosphorus. And some of these algae are poisonous and dangerous for children who want to swim.” Currently, there are 65 projects approved under the Baltic Sea Region Program 2007-2013. Tallinn and Turku, European Capitals of Culture 2011, have organized a joint project for Estonian and Finnish artists who have taken part in an interdisciplinary expedition on the Baltic Sea. The Curated Expedition to the Baltic Sea project competition is intended for finding new and unpublished ideas which consist largely of an expedition on the Baltic Sea. The organizers of the project say that artists who live in Finland or Estonia, irrespective of their nationality, could take part in the competition. Finnish and Estonian artists living abroad could also participate in the joint project. The participants have been given a chance to dive into the deepest corners of the Baltic Sea, look at the Sea through a seagull’s eyes, or at any other level between these two. “We have invited Estonian and Finnish artists and other citizens to marvel about and explore the sea that links us, the natural phenomena connected with it, and your own relationship with the changing sea,” says one of the organizers of the joint project. “The ‘Expedition to the Baltic Sea’ is a cross-disciplinary art project to observe and experience the natural phenomena of the Baltic Sea. The Capital of Culture year is a unique opportunity for both cities to present their own culture, history and future, but also the cooperation that has lasted for centuries in the Baltic Sea region. The projects were organized by Capsula and the Finnish Bioart Society; the project began in autumn 2009 with an open call to Finnish and Estonian artists and creators to present proposals for new works that should include an expedition to the Baltic. Five projects were commissioned by a committee of art and science professionals.” According to the organizers of the expedition, the project wants to turn people’s attention to other possible modes of transport, instead of fast planes, trains and cars. Kayaks, hot air balloons, sailboats, marine expedition ships or rowboats are just some examples of the possible transportation which can be used on artistic expeditions on the sea. “Vessels which move slowly are environmentally friendly and allow for experiencing and observing the surrounding nature as closely as possible should be used for traveling on the Sea. The project itself is a bright example of a good long term cooperation between Estonia and Finland.” According to the project’s management, the projects have to have links with science, but the interpretation of the results and observation should be artistic. According to the management, the taskforce of the Curated Expedition also aims to help artists in finding project partners in the scientific world. A Finnish taskforce, which consists of scientists of various fields, have offered their help during various stages of the process. Some of the selected projects have already been realized in 2010. Most of the stages of the project that started in 2010 and have been realized were performances or workshops. The keywords include standpoint, environmental friendliness, sociality and participation. The organizers claim that the pieces of art use artistic means to turn people’s attention to the environmental state of the Baltic Sea and increase the awareness of people living around the sea of the fact that they are responsible for its future. “The applications that have been applied mentioned the geographical area for realizing the project. It was recommended to realize the projects between the southern coast of Finland and the coast of Estonia. Any projects which were planned to take place elsewhere than the Gulf of Finland, Archipelago Sea and Aland Sea have also been taken into account because of the good reason for the choice of the location, e.g. as some of them have had some special trait or natural phenomena,” says one of the organizers of the project. Moreover, 7,000 euros have been allocated for each project. Authors will continue preparation for the exhibition of their work within the Capital of Culture program of Turku in spring 2011. The expeditions are intended for highlighting wonderful events in nature. Could the phenomena in the surrounding nature be of interest to people living in the world of action films and computer games? Do positive and spectacular experiences with natural phenomena help preserve and respect nature, more than continuous pollution tests or environment-related obligations and regulations? Is it possible to use art for making people interested in getting to know nature and protecting it? These are the questions that the project aims to answer. Curated Expeditions to the Baltic Sea are financed by the Turku 2011 Foundation. The project is part of the Turku 2011 and Tallinn 2011 Capital of Culture program. The art projects selected in the competition have been realized in 2010, which will be presented within the Capital of Culture 2011 program of Turku and Tallinn as well. Curated Expeditions is dedicated to observing and experiencing fascinating earthly phenomena through artistic investigation. The joint project of Tallinn and Turku, European Capitals of Culture 2011, is a continuation of the first interdisciplinary expedition of Capsula from Finland of the full solar eclipse zone in Siberia in summer 2008. The expedition base was in the Novosibirsk Zoo. “This open call for art/science projects has given a unique chance to Finnish and Estonian artists to study and marvel at the Baltic Sea, during cross-disciplinary expeditions by sea-travel. The project is a collaboration between Capsula and the Finnish Bioart Society. We received 70 proposals, from which 5 were from Estonian and 65 from Finnish artists/groups of artists,” says the project manager. During the project some of the Finnish and Estonian artists, with the help of the crew, managed to build two experimental boats with the idea to sail the Finnish coastal area to reach Estonia by sea. They managed to build a 3.7 meter-long boat as well as an 8.5 meter-long vessel made out of recycled materials, mostly donated by different supporters in Tampere, Finland and Turku, Estonia. "
Arctic sea lane could open by 2035,Norway,"Commercial ships could be sailing across an ice-free North Pole as soon as 2035, according to US Navy estimates, slashing the time and cost of ocean transportation between Europe and Asia. The prediction, by the head of the US Navy's climate change task force, highlighted growing international interest in the commercial opportunities created by shrinking Arctic sea ice. ""We believe that sometime between 2035 and 2040, there is a pretty good chance that the Arctic Ocean will be essentially ice-free for about a month,"" said US Rear Admiral Dave Titley, at an Arctic conference in Tromsø, Norway. He predicted that, as the ice-free period gradually increased, the Bering Strait between the US and Russia would begin to rival the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Malacca between Malaysia and Indonesia as one of the world's most important shipping lanes. Climate change sceptics might question such predictions but Mr Titley insists there is no doubt about the long term trend towards reduce ice coverage. Environmentalists caution that any economic benefit from melting ice would be outweighed by the costs of global warming. Mariners have long eyed the potential for an Arctic sea route to transform global trade patterns, with the distance between Rotterdam and Yokohama 40 per cent shorter via the North Pole compared with the Suez Canal. However, Mr Titley warned that increased co-operation was needed among Arctic nations to build the logistical and rescue capabilities needed to support increased commercial activity in the region. Highlighting the risks facing the growing number of cruise liners taking tourists into Arctic waters, he said only luck had so far prevented a ""Titanic-scale disaster"" in the region. Addressing the same conference, Össur Skarphéðinsson, Iceland's foreign minister, said his country was attracting interest from China and Singapore as a potential staging post for cargo routed via the Arctic. ""I'm like a girl at her first dance being flattered by all the attention,"" he joked. ""If you go to the Pacific over the Arctic, Iceland would be a natural place to redistribute cargo."" The prospect of easier access to the Arctic has sparked fears of potential conflict between the big five Arctic coastal states - Russia, Canada, the US, Denmark and Norway - over navigation and mineral rights in a region estimated to hold a quarter of the world's undiscovered oil and gas. Mr Titley said such concerns were overblown. ""The Arctic is not the wild west … It is an ocean and we understand how to govern oceans."" Some non-Arctic countries have suggested the region should be subject to an international treaty similar to the one that governs Antarctica. Such proposals are strongly rejected by the coastal states with territorial claims to Arctic waters. ""There is no difference in principle between how you deal with the Arctic Ocean and how you deal with the Mediterranean or the Atlantic Ocean,"" said Jonas Gahr Støre, Norwegian foreign minister. ""The South Pole is a big rock surrounded by water. The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by coastal states."""
"From oil explorers to lingerie retailers, businesses make safety the prime objective",Norway,"Canadian companies doing business in Egypt are scrambling to ensure that employees there are safe, reassure worried shareholders and decide whether to keep operations open. “We are trying to respond to our shareholders with as much information as we have available,” said Tony Anton, president and chief operating officer of Sea Dragon Energy Inc. “Egypt is still a great place to do business.” His Calgary-based energy company has interests in two concessions in the country's desert. Both are located far south of the unrest that has made global headlines in recent days. All of Sea Dragon's six employees are safe. Yet it has temporarily suspended drilling operations because supplies of diesel fuel are intermittent, since trucks aren't running on a regular basis. More than half-a-dozen Canadian companies, from lingerie retailer La Vie en Rose to engineering giant SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. , have a presence in Egypt. It's the Arab world's third-largest economy, with the sixth-biggest oil reserve in Africa and a population of about 82 million. Global companies, too, are affected. Coca-Cola Co., Cisco Systems Inc. and Volkswagen AG are curtailing operations in Egypt as protesters take to the streets for the seventh day to demonstrate against President Hosni Mubarak. Commercial flights have been cancelled, international banks, such as Barclays PLC and HSBC, are temporarily closing their doors and the country's stock exchange is closed. SNC-Lavalin, Canada's largest construction and engineering company, has a contract to do consulting work on an electricity interconnection project between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The Montreal-based firm has about 50 employees in its Cairo office. “Our Cairo office is closed today and will remain closed until the situation is determined to be more stable,” said Leslie Quinton, vice-president of global corporate communications. “The health and safety of our employees is our No. 1 preoccupation, and we're pleased to report that all our employees are safe.” Montreal-based La Vie en Rose has five stores in the country. A spokesperson wasn't available to comment, though the company said in an e-mail that it is planning to add two more, to bring its total to seven by the end of this year. Others are also looking to expand their presence. IMW Industries, which makes equipment for natural gas fuelling stations, has a technician stranded in Cairo. “It is stressful – he can hear gunfire from his hotel,” said Brad Miller, president of the Chilliwack, B.C.-based firm. “Egypt is actually one of the countries we were looking at setting up a presence in. I'm a little surprised – I didn't expect to see this.” Disruptions have also hit the tourism sector. Transat A.T. Inc. says it has a dozen Canadian vacationers on tour packages in Egypt now, some of whom are on their way home. New bookings continued last week through Wednesday and Thursday, before halting on Friday. Now, the company is steering people to Morocco. Other companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange with a presence in the country include gold producer Centamin Egypt . It says staff and operations so far “have not been impacted in any way” by the recent events in the country. Methanex Corp. , whose shares have skidded in recent days, said the commissioning of its new 1.3-million-tonne-a-year methanol facility in Egypt is on schedule despite the protests. Among global companies, Statoil ASA , Norway's biggest oil producer, halted drilling offshore, while London's GlaxoSmithKline PLC , which has about 900 employees in the country, closed offices and plants yesterday. The unrest, which erupted across Egypt a week ago, has threatened the government's stability, disrupted Internet access and increased the risk of looting for retailers. Thousands of demonstrators gathered again today in central Cairo after defying a curfew during a night of looting and gunfire. As many as 150 people may have died in the protests. For now, most company executives are watching events unfold with concern, and hope. “We don't see this as a reason to stop doing business in Egypt,” said Mr. Anton of Sea Dragon. “They're going through a bit of a hard time right now. But down the road, hopefully the upcoming elections will reflect the desire of the people. It's something we all aspire for, and it's reasonable for them to be demanding it.”"
Campaign Trail.,Norway,"JAMIE SMYTH'Ssideways look at Election 2011 Fianna Fáil takes a pasting from US publications The US media can’t seem to get enough of our economic problems or the looming general election. Fresh from Michael Lewis’s 13,000-word forensic examination of Ireland’s boom to bust in Vanity Fair, the New York Timespenned a strongly worded editorial on Friday savaging Fianna Fáil’s management of the economy and urging a new government to renegotiate its debts with the EU. “Voters rightly blame Fianna Fáil for the reckless policies of recent years, when the ‘Celtic Tiger’ investment boom gave way to a speculative housing bubble fed by lax regulation and cozy ties between bankers and politicians.” “When that bubble burst in 2008, Fianna Fáil pledged more than the government could afford to rescue its banker friends. The bankers emerged nearly whole. Ireland emerged nearly broken,” said an editorial by the newspaper. But the New York Timesdidn’t stop there. It went on to lambast the EU for imposing austerity conditions so strict that they leave Ireland with little chance of paying off its debt. And to the horror of all Fianna Fáil subscribers to the influential US paper, it gave a ringing endorsement to a future Fine Gael/ Labour Government. “Irish opposition parties want to revisit the bailout terms. The Fine Gael party, on the centre-right, wants to negotiate down the 6 per cent interest rate. The Labour Party, its usual centre-left ally, wants time to phase in spending cuts and tax increases. Those positions make economic sense,” said the paper. Quote of the day: Trevor Sargent"" In the case of Fine Gael, the Galway tent has been replaced by the Castlebar campsite and there is no shortage of corporate donations when it comes to larger political partiesGreen TD Trevor Sargent, who is a candidate in the Dublin North constituency, speaking at the party's launch of its plan to ban corporate donations to political partiesWeathering the political storm made easy in poster-free havenThe gale-force winds sweeping the country are causing havoc in towns and villages across the country with pedestrians forced to dodge fast-flying election posters, which have been ripped from lampposts by the stormy weather.Not so in the village of Newmarket on Fergus in Co Clare, where a 12-year-old prohibition on election posters has created an atmosphere of electoral calm rarely seen in other places.“It was decided that election posters in around Newmarket on Fergus and on the approach roads to the village looked very tacky,” says the environmental services manager Brendan McInerney of community group Obair, which organised the initiative with the local tidy towns committee.“If candidates erect posters inside the boundary we have set, we contact them and ask them to remove them or we take them down and put them into storage so that the candidates can collect them. We don’t destroy them because we know they cost money to make but we do remove them.”McInerney admits that the local poster ban has no legal standing but says it has been very successful.If the country suffers another weekend of windy weather like the last one, health and safety officials may float the idea of poster bans in other areas. In the meantime, those seeking a moment of calm from the political storm can seek solace in Newmarket on Fergus.Policy Proposal of the Day: Transforming the state’s “ghost estates’’There wouldn't be ghost estates any more if there were tourists staying in them.

Make tiger soup to give politicians from any of those parties a jolly good scalding if they have the cheek to come to your door,” she said.Ms Sweeney, who pulled out of the Donegal South West byelection at the 11th hour last November, says she believes there is enough oil and gas off the Irish coast to get the economy back in the black.“There’s about €600 billion of it there in the lifetime of the Corrib field and Bertie Ahern signed it over to Norway, Shell, Statoil and a Canadian conglomerate on a 25-year retrospective tax break.”“Norway now has a universal healthcare service on those profits and we can’t even get a doctor unless you pay through some insurance company,” she said.Strong words from a candidate, who has the small print “B....x to the bailout” embossed on one of her campaign posters.Words from the leaders . . . “I accept where you are coming from in the sense that you are angry and so on and you have your own perspective on it and the only way we can sort out this country is to get involved and change the system and make it work better for the people. - Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin “There are two Irelands . . .

"Oslo blocks Arctic oil impact study, ducks crisis",Norway,"Norway's government will not probe the possibility of oil exploration around the idyllic Arctic archipelago of Lofoten, the prime minister said Friday, thereby avoiding the implosion of his centre-left coalition. ""There won't be an impact study"" during the current legislative term which ends in 2013, to evaluate the eventual consequences of oil exploration in the area of the archipelago, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference. An impact study, aiming to determine the opportunities and challenges for the search and extraction of natural resources, is considered the first step towards opening up an area to exploration. The government said it would still however collect some information which could be relevent to an eventual impact study in the future, the prime minister said. Stoltenberg's Labour Party, the lead coalition partner that has long been undecided on the issue, has thus sided with its political allies, the Centre and Socialist Left parties, which are adamantly opposed to all oil activities in the region due to its fragile ecosystem and its importance to the country's fishing and tourism industries. The government's decision comes as a hard blow to oil companies facing a rapid depletion of their existing North Sea reserves and eager to explore new and untapped areas. ""These maritime areas ... are the most promising for the industry and those where we could launch production the most quickly,"" Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF) head Gro Braekken said. ""We are very unhappy about this new delay,"" she said in a statement, stressing the region contained some 1.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent, which amounts to ""the Norwegian production for one year,"" according to Environment Minister Erik Solheim. State-owned energy giant Statoil meanwhile stressed the government's decision was not a major roadblock for the industry. ""The government’s decision is not the one that Statoil and the Norwegian oil and gas industry have argued,"" chief executive Helge Lund said. ""However, the fact-finding process now being initiated means that, once a decision to carry out an impact assessment has been taken, less time is needed to open up for exploration activity,"" he said, adding: ""That is positive."" Many observers had cautioned that a Labour Party ""yes"" to an impact study would have plunged the government into deep crisis. The government however announced that it does intend to open up new zones in the Barents Sea to prospection and to launch an impact study on waters now attributed to Norway after a border deal was signed with Russia. The rightwing opposition parties, which favour opening up Lofoten to oil exploration, stressed that the archipelago was not being placed off limits indefinitely and that the debate could be resumed after the next general elections in 2013. Norwegian opposition to Arctic oil exploration swelled following the BP Deepwater Horizon accident last year that killed 11 people and caused a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. phy/nl-rdm/pvh"
Heated seats in a frozen wonderland; A luxurious Porsche SUV takes the chill off a trip to the end of the highway at Prudhoe Bay,Norway,"DEADHORSE, ALASKA -- DEADHORSE, ALASKA - The old guy loading supplies onto the snow machine's trailer nodded toward our cars and asked the inevitable question. ""I saw you down at the Safeway in Fairbanks. You're driving up to Prudhoe? Why do you want to do that?"" Because it's an adventure, we told him. Because it's the end of the Alaska road. Because it's as far north as anyone can drive in North America, farther even than Inuvik or Tuktoyaktuk in Canada. Because it's there. ""Okay,"" he said, and paused for a moment. ""But why do you want to do that?"" If anyone could understand, it should be this guy - a man intimately acquainted with the lure of the far north. We met him at a turn-off from the fabled Dalton Highway, just an hour's drive below the Arctic Circle. He was loading fresh fruit and vegetables onto the trailer to take to his roadless community 30 kilometres up the Yukon River. But he did not understand. He smiled, shook his head politely and returned to the task, and we walked back through the crisp April air to the four Porsche Cayennes with their heated seats, heated steering wheels and thick, contoured leather. If truth be told, none of us could really answer the question, either. I've been accompanying a group of nine Italians who love Porsches and cold places, and who flew into Vancouver late last month from their homes at Pesaro in balmy central Italy to make this drive. All own Porsche Cayenne SUVs and love them so much that they make annual winter excursions to challenging places: northern Scotland, Iceland, Norway's Nordkap. This month, after two years of preparation, they left Europe for this cold drive north to America's Arctic coast. Porsche Canada supplied the vehicles and some logistic help, and I'm tagging along for the ride. I've always wanted to drive to Prudhoe Bay. Not sure why. The convoy headed north through British Columbia and the Yukon before crossing into central Alaska and reaching Fairbanks Tuesday, where we stocked up on decent coffee and junk food. The Dalton Highway starts 135 km north of town and the road turns immediately to hard-packed gravel, perhaps to deter whimsical tourists. This is the Haul Road, not a sightseeing route but a supply highway to the oil field communities of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, and a maintenance highway for the northern half of the 1,300 km Alaska pipeline. It doesn't take long for the pipeline to show itself, running raised above the ground and close to the road. Almost half is buried, whenever there's no danger of it warming the permafrost, and a dozen giant pumping stations along the way provide the pressure to keep the oil moving. There are mountains here, white and jagged against the blue sky, and the road twists and curves at their base. It's wide enough for two trucks to pass comfortably and the surface soon changes back to smooth asphalt. though with the occasional dip that keeps you awake. It's built mostly above the surface on a bed of raised gravel, partly to better drain itself as protection from frost heaves and to insulate the permafrost below, but also to provide a buffer that prevents snow from sweeping directly across the surface. It can snow here on any day of the year, and although it's such a dry climate that true storms are infrequent, what snow there is doesn't melt but just accumulates until late May. We pressed on north from the Yukon River and soon reached the Arctic Circle, where there's a turn-off and a large sign that thrilled the visitors. Most vacationers on this road visit from May to September and few will see the deep snow that blocks the washrooms and the picnic tables, but for us, the strong, windless sun felt almost warm and it was comfortable to read the information posters. The Italians unfurled a large sign to pose for photos, and then we drove north for another hour to our beds for the night. The beds were at Coldfoot, a former mining community that is the only public source for fuel and food along the 666 km of the road. After construction of the highway was completed in just the five summer months of 1974, and the pipeline was completed three years later, the workers' house trailers from a nearby camp were moved here and turned into lodging, alongside a restaurant and saloon; we stayed in comfortable prefabricated and connected rooms and chatted to truckers till late into the night. Those professional drivers couldn't understand the appeal of driving without getting paid for it, either, but they were angry with us that one of our party - another Canadian guest driving the Cayenne that towed the trailer - had been travelling too fast for their liking. At least twice, he'd not moved properly over to the side of the road to let them pass. We assured them that somebody else would be driving the trailer the next day. Just as well, they said - we'll run him off the road next time. And they were serious. You don't mess around up here. In fact, the next day brought the most challenging section of the drive by far, when we reached the 4,800-foot Atigun Pass - this is the Continental Divide and the highest highway pass in Alaska. If you watch Ice Road Truckers on TV, this is where much of the action takes place. The road has a 12 per cent grade and trucks must stop before the long climb to chain up their driving tires. The only way to get through is to take it slow and steady, and we followed a pair of heavy haulers that were themselves escorted by chase pickups to prepare the way. With four-wheel drive, Pirelli winter tires and hundreds of horsepower, we had a much easier time of it than those transport trucks. And on the other side, after dropping steeply onto the Arctic watershed, we saw the trees had disappeared and the temperature had dropped to -20 C. The guidebook warned that these last 275 km have the worst weather on the highway, which means the snow blows across the clear tundra and sweeps the road.High posts to each side mark the route for the plows and we stayed between those posts, with nothing now to see except flat white on each side, blurring into a white sky. The road here is hard-pack again, iced in the winter to protect it from the heavy tires and coated in the summer with calcium chloride to keep down the dust, which makes it both corrosive and slippery. But it's still worth it on the machinery if it means the trucks can complete the long haul to supply the oil fields at the ocean. For us, though - was it worth it? For tourists with no reason to visit except to look around and then return south? We pulled up to the town's solitary working gas pump this evening, where the price of unleaded wasn't even marked but sells for about $5 a U.S. gallon, and looked around to ask ourselves the same question. Was it worth it? We're still a couple of kilometres short of the Arctic Ocean here, and cannot pass the oilfield security gates to get to the frozen water. We went there and were turned back. There's nothing else to see at this time of year except prefab buildings and white expanse - the small lake and summer wildflowers are nothing but flat snow and ice. This truly is the end of the road. Soon, we'll return south and retrace our route down to Fairbanks, and then to Anchorage. But when we're home and we next look at the map, and our eyes trace that red line that slides to the top of the paper, or slips off the top of the screen, we'll nod and perhaps even smile. Another mystery will have been answered. Maybe not explained, but answered nonetheless. Mark Richardson is the editor of Wheels. mrichardson@thestar.ca.

Would you swap your kingdom for a Norse?,Norway,"WHAT must be the Norwegians think of us? It’s a rhetorical question, meaning I can answer it myself, comprehensively and authoritatively. I answer thus: they look down on us. You’re shocked but, when you think about it, they’re right to do so. They look on our grey houses, grey pies and grey faces distorted by damp winds, and they titter. As untutored teutons, they also buy into the myth that we are mean, and will quite happily say that to your grey face when you meet them. Even after you’ve wrestled them to the ground and are twisting their earlobes, they insist on deploying such stereotypes, which include the one that Norwegians aren’t racist. But, in many other respects, their tittering is the correct response to our Scottishness. They see us as comical. Of course, we do ourselves no favours wearing kilts and so forth. How bewildered they look when you say: “Would you excuse me a moment? There is a breeze swirling round my Cairngorms, so I would fain repair indoors to sit by the fireside with my legs crossed. Och aye at the moment!” I have worn a kilt once, at a wedding in France, and rather enjoyed the experience. It’s the nearest I’ve come to sexual perversion. The kilt makes us stand out from other countries, with their new-fangled “trousers”, and separates the men from the boys, while simultaneously confusing the men with the women. I do not wish to stray far from my point, particularly as I am unclear what it is. However, I can feel it being delivered now by vacuum-tube from the basement of my mind to the director’s office whence I make the following announcement: a Norwegian in, surprisingly enough, Norway bent down at the seashore in excitement as he spied a message in a bottle. The bottle had come all the way from Scotland. What would it say? Hi? Greetings from bonny Scotia? Good luck to you? No. None of the above. It said: “You smell.” True, it was sent by a child but, all the same, how embarrassing. The Norwegian under advisement, Magne-Nenrik Velde, shook his head in bewilderment and said: “This is not an everyday experience.” He was wearing a checked shirt, as many of them do – and you know my positive views on that subject. To fully apprise you of the situation, I should add that there was more to the message. Prior to the olfactory allegation, the sender had inquired: “Hello, how’s you?” This curious deployment of English will have confused the Norskie – for such is how they are known –as they tend to do things by the book. The sender revealed him or herself to be from the Aberdeen area, which may well be sufficient explanation for most of you. But I remain uneasy. In his innocent, foreign way, Monsieur Velde opined of the bottle-bunger: “It would be fun for them to know the letter has been found.” But, deep inside, he must be hurting, and I feel his pain. Norwegians are used only to praise, and they get quite upset when you tell them that they smell or that, on the whole, they are a boring and prosaic people, lacking the sparkling poetry and unpredictable violence of the Celt. Such allegations lead to sustained self-examination, a vice at which they excel. Still, on the whole, they need only look at us to feel cheered up. They see what we have in common. Roughly similar latitudes in north-western Europe, mountains, fishing, tourism, oil, same size of population. They’re routinely name-checked as the richest or even happiest country in the world. We’re routinely name-checked for worst health, poverty, yada and, on some indices, yada-yada. Suffice to say, it’s sad but true, we Scots are not as other men. The Norwegians are free, independent men and women in checked shirts and attractive blouses. We, meanwhile, are a dependent people in tracksuit bottoms, timidly letting others plunder our wealth then becoming addicted to their handouts. Accordingly, Mr Velde would be entitled to say: “Thanks for the message. I always knew you Scots were good at bottling it.”"
Arctic countries seek cooperation as ice melts,Norway,"Top diplomats from eight Arctic countries will meet Thursday to set down rules for opening the vast region to fishing, tourism, oil and mineral exploration as global warming melts the ice. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her colleagues from Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden will gather in Greenland's tiny capital of Nuuk to discuss how to manage the area's development while protecting its fragile ecosystem. With its capital of 16,000 people, Greenland will be represented by Denmark, which handles foreign affairs for the sprawling self-ruled territory of 65,000 inhabitants neighboring northeastern Canada. Heather Conley, an Arctic expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the gathering is historic, in part because it is the first time a US secretary of state will attend the ministerial talks. It ""is a historic turning point to deepen and strengthen international cooperation in the Arctic as we seek to meet the dramatic challenges of the equivalent of a melting continent over the next several decades,"" she said. Clinton's deputy Jim Steinberg said the seventh biennial ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council -- composed of the eight countries and the region's indigenous groups -- also marks another step away from the Cold War. ""We want to send a strong message that in the post-Cold War world the Arctic is a region of cooperation, not conflict,"" he told a gathering hosted by the CSIS think tank in Washington. ""By working together to ensure the safety of human life in a newly emerging region of human activity we can show in particular that Russia and the United States are key actors in helping to propel cooperation on core issues."" Clinton and her counterparts are due to sign an Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement, which the State Department said will be the first binding international agreement among the eight Arctic states. During talks in Iceland in December, the ministers drafted an agreement that divides the Arctic into specific search and rescue areas, with each nation legally responsible for its own territory. Icelandic officials said such an agreement was all the more important as an increasing number of people now sail through the Arctic as waterways open up with the melting ice. In August last year, a Russian oil tanker set off for China on a previously impassable route through the Arctic Ocean. Cruises with tourists are also venturing into the Arctic, particularly around the US state of Alaska. Earlier this month scientists said that warming in the Arctic is occurring at twice the global average and is on track to lift sea levels by up to 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) by 2100, a far steeper jump than predicted a few years ago. Steinberg said Washington wants the Nuuk talks to launch a task force designed to negotiate an instrument for handling Arctic oil spills. ""We know that there are significant deposits of oil and gas that were in the past difficult to access and may become more accessible over time,"" he said. The United States wants the Arctic countries to be prepared to both prevent oil spills or other disasters and to create ""effective mechanisms to deal with accidents should they happen,"" Steinberg said. More than one fifth of the world's undiscovered but technically recoverable reserves of hydrocarbons are located north of the Arctic Circle, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The region accounts for about 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas, USGS data shows. About 84 percent of the resources are offshore. Exploration off Greenland has yet to produce any commercially exploitable reserves, but that did not stop British firm Cairn from boosting its investment there by one billion dollars on the back of ""encouraging"" first results. Alaska, where the Prudhoe Bay oil field has been operating since 1977, is currently the most exploited area of the Arctic and its wells are responsible for more than one tenth of US oil production. Washington also sees the potential for new fisheries to emerge as the ice retreats, according to David Balton, the US deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries. The meeting in Nuuk aims to establish a permanent secretariat for the Arctic Council, with Iceland offering to host it in Reykjavik and Norway proposing its northern city of Tromso, Balton said. Clinton, who leaves for Nuuk on Wednesday, will be accompanied by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other officials, a testament to the importance Washington attaches to the meeting. Clinton and the ministers will gather for dinner Wednesday evening. lc/jk/ss"
Leaked cables show tension over Arctic: Greenpeace,Norway,"A rush for the Arctic's resources is sparking military tension in the region, Greenpeace said Thursday quoting leaked diplomatic cables, as foreign ministers from Arctic countries gathered in Greenland. ""New revelations by... WikiLeaks show how the scramble for resources in the Arctic is sparking military tension in the region -- with NATO sources worried about the potential for armed conflict between the alliance and Russia,"" it said. According to the environmental group, cables obtained by WikiLeaks show how ""Russia is maneuvering to claim ownership over huge swathes of the Arctic,"" while the United States desires to take a strong position in Greenland and tensions are mounting within NATO. A US diplomatic note reads ""our intensified outreach to the Greenlanders will encourage them to resist any false choice between the United States and Europe."" Another dispatch from Canada said Prime Minister Stephen Harper was quoted by diplomats as saying a NATO presence in the Arctic would ""give non-Arctic members of the Western alliance too much influence in an area where 'they don’t belong',"" Greenpeace said. The environmental group charged the cables' revelations ""expose something profoundly concerning."" ""Instead of seeing the melting of the Arctic ice cap as a spur to action on climate change, the leaders of the Arctic nations are instead investing in military hardware to fight for the oil beneath it,"" campaigner Ben Ayliffe said. ""They’re preparing to fight to extract the very fossil fuels that caused the melting in the first place. It’s like pouring gasoline on a fire,"" he added. Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met Thursday in Greenland's tiny capital to set down rules for opening the Arctic to fishing, tourism, oil and mineral exploration as global warming melts the ice. rdm/cw"
Salmond's plan to cut North Sea tax on jobs,Norway,"ALEX Salmond yesterday launched a new bid to persuade the UK Government to ditch a North Sea oil and gas tax grab which could cost 15,000 jobs. Chancellor George Osborne delivered a sharp hike in the supplementary tax on production from 20 per cent to 32 per cent to pay for a 1p cut in fuel duty. Mr Osborne has previously ruled out a U-turn on that decision, which will raise an extra £2billion a year for the Treasury coffers, despite a backlash from industry chiefs. Norwegian giant Statoil almost immediately halted investment plans while others, including gas firm Centrica, announced they were reviewing investments worth tens of millions. Mr Salmond, who failed to persuade the Chancellor to change course at a meeting last month, yesterday unveiled his own ""Plan B"" proposals. The SNP leader said: ""It is in no one's interest to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, and if he's not exactly killing it, then he's in danger of severely disabling it, therefore I hope and believe he will listen to the arguments. ""If nothing was done about the supplementary charge, then the likelihood is there will be 15,000 less jobs than would have been the case without the supplementary charge. What that means in revenue terms is that over the next 10 years there will be one billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent less."" The First Minister's plan is called UK Continental Shelf Tax Regime - Options For Reform and is based on proposals made by Aberdeen University professor Alex Kemp. It sets out three measures to make the tax regime ""more progressive"" and reduce tax on less profitable projects which would otherwise be shelved. Mr Salmond's preferred option is the ""investment rate of return allowance"" which guarantees oil and gas companies a minimum rate of return on their investment. The second option is ""investment uplift allowance"" which would also guarantee companies a minimum rate of return on investments before the supplementary charge was applied. The third is ""extended field allowances"" which would reduce the amount of tax the firms pay on their profits. Industry chiefs claim at least 25 projects, accounting for more than a billion barrels of oil and gas are likely to be axed because of the levy. Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray endorsed the proposed reform. He said: ""This tax was ill-thought out and introduced without proper consideration and consultation."" But a Treasury spokesman said: ""The Government does not believe the tax changes in the Budget will have a significant effect on future investment in the North Sea. ""The Government is continuing its dialogue with the industry on supporting investment in marginal cases."" ?North Sea oil and gas is worth at least twice the value of tourism to Scotland's economy, according to a new study. The Survey of International Activity in the Oil and Gas Sector said sales from Scottish firms hit a new record of nearly £16billion in 2009. Tourism is worth about £7billion a year."
Stavanger,Norway,"Travel | 48 hours Midsummer bestows added illumination on this Norwegian harbour city, extending the opportunity to explore its cultural and maritime heritage. By Simon Calder Travel essentials Why go now? Midsummer is when Norway's oil capital is at its brightest. Near-continuous daylight illuminates this fascinating harbour city, with its mix of pretty wooden structures draped over the hills and along the quaysides, augmented by modern trappings. And as the oil business is not so slick in July, hotels offer bargains. Touch down Stavanger's Sola airport is served non-stop from Heathrow by BMI (0870 60 70 555; flybmi.com) and SAS (0870 60 727 727; flysas.co.uk); from Gatwick by Norwegian (020-8099 7254; norwegian.no); and from Aberdeen and Newcastle by SAS and its partner Wideroe in competition with Eastern Airways (08703 669100; eastern airways.co.uk). Airport buses (00 47 51 59 90 60; flybussen.no) leave the terminal every 20 minutes, covering the 14km to the centre in about 20 minutes and serving a number of points in the city, including the railway/bus station (1) and Fiskepirterminalen (2) ferry terminal. A one-way trip costs Nkr95 (£11); returns, valid a month, Nkr150 (£17.50). Get your bearings Stavanger is splendidly compact and attractive, and focused on the twin harbours of Vagen to the west and Ostre Havn to the east. The oldest part is Gamle Stavanger, also known as Straen, rising west of Vagen and decorated by 173 wooden buildings. Today, the kernel of the city is the thumb of land extending between the harbours. Inland from here, the buildings get younger - with the exception of the mighty cathedral (3), on the north shore of the city lake. The railway station (1) is on the south side. Stavanger has an efficient bus service, with each stop in the city numbered, and traffic is never a problem; a network of tunnels keeps cars out of the centre. The tourist office (4) is just above the cathedral at Domkirkeplassen 3 (00 47 51 85 92 00; regionstavanger.com). It opens 9am-8pm daily until the end of August. Besides maps and information, bikes are available to rent. Check in Room rates may be high, but so too is value - a breakfast buffet and free Wi-Fi are standard in Stavanger. Plumb on the quayside, the plum-coloured Victoria (5) at Skansegaten 1 (00 47 51 86 70 00; victoria-hotel.no) is the most atmospheric place to stay - a grand 19th-century creation that has been updated without losing its ambience. It is offering summer bargains: a standard double room in a fortnight's time costs as little as Nkr795 (£88). Of Stavanger's many modern alternatives, the Thon Hotel Maritim (6) at Kongsgata 32 (00 47 51 85 0500; thonhotels.no) is probably the most appealing: a central and comfortable business hotel that, in July and at weekends, offers some deals starting at around Nkr1,902 (£221) including unlimited free coffee while lounging about in the stylish reception. The lowest rates year-round can usually be found in the south of the city at Stavanger St Svithun (7) (00 47 51 51 26 00; hihostels.no), part of the national youth hostel network but unlike any hostel you may have stayed in. It is actually part of the university hospital complex, and is mostly occupied by the relatives of patients. The nightly rate for a comfortable triple room is Nkr950 (£110), with a 10 per cent discount for YHA members. Day one Take a hike Walk up to Valberg Tower (8) (00 47 90 72 63 94), built in 1850 as a watchtower intended to guard against fires in the city and aboard ships moored in the harbour. Even from the surrounds of the tower you get excellent views across the city; wait until 11am, when the tower opens, and for Nkr30 (£3.50) you get a splendid panorama from the top (to 3pm daily). Window shopping The main retail area spills prettily through the winding streets beneath Valberg Tower, with a concentration of boutiques on Ovre Holmegate. For large purchases, you can reclaim tax - Norway is outside the EU. For British visitors feeling the financial pinch, Europe's most upmarket charity shop is Fretex (9) - the Salvation Army Store at the corner of Ovre Holmegate and Ostervag. And Tilbords (10), a friendly gift shop on Valberget, dispenses free coffee to passers-by. Lunch on the run Planted handily amid the shopping district, Ostehuset (11) at Hospitalsgaten 6 (00 47 51 86 40 10; ostehuset.no) is a bright, modern location serving soups, salads and sandwiches at reasonable prices in relaxed surroundings. Cultural afternoon Forty years ago this month, Norway's first oil field opened - and began the process of turning the nation into one of Europe's richest. The benefits - and costs - of this precious commodity are told in spectacular fashion at the Norwegian Petroleum Museum (12), which dominates the quayside at Havneringen (00 47 51 93 93 00; norskolje.museum.no). The chronicle begins with an official 1960s pronouncement that Norway will never have a viable oil industry, and does not shirk the dangers associated with exploitation of oil and gas; you can even test out an oil rig escape chute. In summer it opens 10am-7pm daily; admission is Nkr100 (£11.50). As a 2008 European Capital of Culture, Stavanger is so serious about its heritage that it even has a museum devoted to promoting some of its other two-dozen museums. The MUST Infosenter (13) at Nedre Strandgate 21 (museumstavanger.no) occupies a lovely former warehouse on the quayside; the upper floor has been transformed into a sailing museum explaining life on board a transatlantic sailing ship in 1899. Open 10am-5pm daily, admission free. An aperitif Boker og Borst (14) at Holmegata 32 (00 47 51 86 04 76; bokerogborst.com) is a colourful venue which does what its name suggests (it translates as ""Books and Booze""). You can sip beer or cocktails while browsing through the shelves. Dining with the locals Timbuktu Sushi (15), by the waterside at Nedre Strandgate 15 (00 47 51 84 37 40; herlige-restauranter.no), sounds like the ultimate fusion restaurant. The sharing menus offer a taste of much of the menu - for Nkr490 (£57) you get to sample all the main courses - butterfish, halibut, duck and sirloin - plus all the starters or desserts. Day two Sunday morning: go to church The Domkirken cathederal (3) dominates the city centre: a bulky, austere structure from the outside, but when it opens (for the 11am service on Sundays, erratically at other times) you discover a cavernous, atmospheric location that feels as though it is the work of giants. It is Norway's oldest church, with origins in the 12th century; the most striking sight is the baroque pulpit, resembling a ship's figurehead. Take a hike From the Domkirken (3), make a clockwise circuit of the lake, then go off at a tangent into Gamle Stavanger - the old part of the city that comprises a jumble of white clapboard structures set on cobbled lanes. Not all of these are cottages and shops: the Norwegian Canning Museum (16) at Ovre Strandgate 88 (00 47 51 84 27 00; stavanger.museum.no) occupies one of the dozens of former canning factories that dominated the city a century ago. It tells the messy but profitable story of sardine canning, and has a gallery of sardine-tin art: more compelling than it may sound. You can also try your hand at packing sardines. Next, descend to Vagen, then walk around the magnificent harbour - which may well have one or two massive cruise ships in port. At the point where the Atlantic reaches deepest inland, watch out for one of Antony Gormley's bronze self-sculptures, planted here as part of a disjointed column stretching down from the Art Museum. Continue around the shore, following the ""Blue Promenade"" footpath to the Geopark - the bizarre concrete park outside the Norwegian Petroleum Museum (12), filled with redundant relics of the oil exploration business. Out to brunch Set on the ground floor of the Petroleum Museum (12), Bolgen & Moi (00 47 51 93 93 51; bolgenogmoi.no) is part of an upmarket chain, and ideally appreciated in the middle of the day, when its spectacular location shines at its best (11am-5pm daily). Seafood is the main strength, but you can opt for something simple such as soup or salad, served with panache. Take a ride Even under grey skies, it is worth taking the three-hour boat excursion from Stavanger to the spectacular Lysefjord. This is a journey that allows you to see the city from the sea, then to pass beneath one of the spectacular bridges created as a result of oil wealth, which marks the beginning of Lysefjord. The main focus for many passengers is Pulpit Rock, the wedge of rock 600m above the water. But the stories of settlements on the fjord are equally intriguing, and if the captain is game - and the water is flowing - you can get happily drenched as the ship almost dips beneath a spectacular waterfall. Two companies compete: Tide (00 47 51 86 87 88; tide.no) from the Fiskepirterminalen (2) at noon, for Nkr360 (£42); and Rodne (00 47 51 89 52 70; rodne.no) from Skagen-kaien (17) at 10.30am and 2.30pm, in July and August; Nkr390 (£45).

Thawing Arctic opens up new shipping routes on the 'roof of the world',Norway,"An increasing amount of seaborne traffic is moving along a new Siberian coastal route, cutting journey time and boosting trade prospects Cold is the new hot in shipping circles as melting sea ice opens up prospects for trade between China and the west to move across the roof of the world. An increasing amount of seaborne traffic is beginning to move on the so-called Northern Sea Route which traverses the Siberian coast. There are also hopes of opening up more of the North West Passage above Canada. The attraction of the voyage is that it is one-third of the distance of more traditional routes through the Suez Canal. This means less carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions and less fuel. It also means less pirates. Attacks on ships off Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden have become so severe that some owners are already using longer sea routes around South Africa to avoid conflict. Christian Bonfils, the managing director of Nordic Barents operator Nordic Bulk Carriers, claims it will save him $180,000 in fuel costs. New Arctic voyages are starting all the time. Russian oil company, Novatek is currently carrying a trial shipment of 60,000 tonnes of oil products to China via northern Siberia on the vessel, Perseverance. Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel producer, has just broken new ground by carrying ore from the Arctic port of Dudinka to Rotterdam in Holland. Two tankers owned by Murmansk Shipping, the Varzuga and Indiga, loaded with 27,000 tonnes of petroleum, recently moved through the ice-thinned passage from Murmansk to Chukotka in the Russian far east. Sovcomflot, Russia's major shipowner, took one of its 70,000-dead weight tonnage tankers from Russia to the far east on this route. And another state-owned Russian company, Atomflot, says it is handling more inquiries than ever before for east-to-west voyages transiting the north coast of Siberia. Atomflot provides the nuclear-powered icebreakers that are currently required by the Russian government to escort the growing number of cargo vessels braving the journey. But it is not all plain sailing. Quite a lot of the Arctic routes are not properly mapped and surveyed while there is a serious dispute in Canada over whether the famous North West Passage is international water or sovereign territory. Meanwhile the Russian authorities are still trying to decide what to do about dumped radioactive materials left along the route. The Tsivolka Inlet on Novaya Zemyla has been used as a burial ground for nuclear reactors such as the one from the first atomic-powered icebreaker, the Lenin. The gathering interest in the Northern Sea Route is being generated by a political as well as a physical thaw. Global warming is reducing the thickness and immovability of the ice but Moscow is changing too. Russia under Dmitry Medvedev is an increasingly outward-looking country willing to compromise and co-operate. Last week in Murmansk, the Russian president signed a bilateral agreement with Norway after a 40-year row over sea boundaries. It started with arguments over fish but has become a negotiation largely driven by prospects for oil and gas in the Barents Sea and beyond. Wider political changes are happening as the Arctic increasingly becomes a hunting ground for minerals rather than the seals of the past. The shipowners believe that this route could gradually be open for transit up to four months per year as air and sea temperatures increase. But they also foresee a world ahead when vessels can take a direct east-west route right across the north pole. Viktor Basargin, Russian regional development minister, has said that cargo shipments via the North Sea Route could rise from its current level of 3m tonnes annually to 30m ""in the near future."" Canadian and American maritime experts say 2% of global shipping could be diverted to the Arctic by 2030, rising to 5% by 2050. Already cruise ships are bringing tourists and income to countries such as Greenland. But they are also raising concerns about safety and pollution from oil spills. There is a widespread view that it is only a matter of time before there is a potential emergency: a passenger ship in trouble and potential evacuation into freezing seas. Even with the best of intentions, the wider shipping industry will have accidents. Collisions are certainly more likely in areas of thick fog and where some navigational equipment might malfunction in extreme cold. Accidents are also more likely where mapping of the seabed is extremely patchy – as it is throughout the polar region. This summer an ice-strengthened cruise ship, the Clipper Adventurer, hit an uncharted ""underwater cliff"" off Nunavut, northern Canada. Yet this is an area where an extensive search-and-rescue capability is only just being planned for inside the Arctic Council, where Russia, Canada and other coastal states discuss issues of the day. The International Maritime Organisation has a set of ""guidelines"" for cruise ship operators and others about how to proceed in the area but it is only that – advice. A wider polar code is now being developed by the UN organisation but it must be formulated, agreed and then ratified. That is a process that usually takes many years but even then there will still be issues outside its scope. For instance, risks to indigenous communities in the Arctic must be considered, along with threats to biodiversity in the region? The movement of vessels from one side of the world to another can bring unexpected and unwanted results: sea creatures attach to the bottom of boats or are carried in water needed as ballast to balance a ship. Aggressive, new species arriving from one region can have a devastating impact elsewhere. The Finnish government warned in a study published this summer into the potential impact of shipping that ""combating oil spills in icy water is almost impossible with the current technology"". And scientists have warned that emissions from cargo ships using the Arctic will accelerate global warming. ""One of the most potent 'short-lived climate forcers' in diesel emissions is black carbon, or soot,"" says James Corbett, a marine scientist at the University of Delaware who has worked with Canadian colleagues to look at the impact of shipping in the far north. ""Ships operating in or near the Arctic use advanced diesel engines that release black carbon into one of the most sensitive regions for climate change,"" he says in a study first published in the journal, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. The study team's key conclusion, based on the modelling of future emissions in the region, is that ""short-lived forcing of about 4.5 gigatons of black carbon from Arctic shipping may increase the global warming potential due to ships' carbon dioxide emissions by some 17 to 78%."" guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2011"
Northwest Passage: Who needs Suez? Thaw opens up new route,Norway,"Cold is the new hot in shipping circles as melting sea ice opens up prospects for trade between China and the west to move across the roof of the world. An increasing amount of seaborne traffic is beginning to move on the so-called Northern Sea Route, which traverses the Siberian coast. There are also hopes of opening up more of the Northwest Passage above Canada. The attraction of the voyage is that it is a third of the distance of more traditional routes through the Suez Canal. This means lower CO2 emissions, less fuel - and fewer pirates. Attacks on ships off Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden have become so severe that some owners already use longer sea routes around South Africa to avoid conflict. Christian Bonfils, the managing director of Nordic Barents operator Nordic Bulk Carriers, claims it will save him $180,000 (pounds 112,000) in fuel costs. New Arctic voyages are starting all the time. A Russian oil company, Novatek, is currently carrying a trial shipment of 60,000 tonnes of oil products to China via northern Siberia on the vessel Perseverance. Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel producer, has just broken new ground by carrying ore from the Arctic port of Dudinka to Rotterdam in Holland. Two tankers owned by Murmansk Shipping, the Varzuga and Indiga, loaded with 27,000 tonnes of petroleum, recently moved through the ice-thinned passage from Murmansk to Chukotka in the Russian far east. But it is not all plain sailing. Quite a lot of the Arctic routes are not properly mapped and surveyed while there is a serious dispute in Canada over whether the famous Northwest Passage is international water or sovereign territory. Meanwhile the Russian authorities are still trying to decide what to do about dumped radioactive materials left along the route. The Tsivolka Inlet on Novaya Zemyla has been used as a burial ground for nuclear reactors such as the one from the first atomic-powered icebreaker, the Lenin. The gathering interest in the Northern Sea Route is being generated by a political as well as a physical thaw. Global warming is reducing the thickness and immovability of the ice but Moscow is changing too. Russia under Dmitry Medvedev is an increasingly outward-looking country . Last week in Murmansk, the Russian president signed a bilateral agreement with Norway after a 40-year row over sea boundaries. It started with arguments over fish but has become a negotiation largely driven by prospects for oil and gas in the Barents Sea and beyond. Wider political changes are happening as the Arctic increasingly becomes a hunting ground for minerals rather than the seals of the past. The shipowners believe that this route could gradually be open for transit up to four months per year as air and sea temperatures increase. But they also foresee a world ahead when vessels can take a direct east-west route right across the north pole. Canadian and American maritime experts say 2% of global shipping could be diverted to the Arctic by 2030, rising to 5% by 2050. Already cruise ships are bringing tourists and income to countries such as Greenland. But they are also raising concerns about safety and pollution from oil spills. There is a widespread view that it is only a matter of time before there is an emergency: a passenger ship in trouble and potential evacuation into freezing seas. Even with the best of intentions, the wider shipping industry will have accidents. Collisions are more likely in areas of thick fog and where some navigational equipment might malfunction in extreme cold. The International Maritime Organisation has a set of ""guidelines"" for cruise ship operators and others about how to proceed in the area but it is only that - advice. A wider polar code is now being developed by the UN organisation but it must be formulated, agreed and then ratified."
Comment : Sovereign debt crisis is the real story in the rest of the world,Norway,"Murdoch dominated the headlines but the real story of the week remained the international debt crisis. Equities went down while oil, gold and sovereign interest rate spreads went shooting up. The cause was not new economic data, though the US recovery still looks alarmingly weak after poor trade figures on Tuesday. Rather, it was the continuing inability of politicians on both sides of the Atlantic to show leadership on the debt crisis. In Europe, the latest EU plan to bail out Greece began unravelling because the Germans are insisting that private investors take a haircut on their loans. Predictably, the markets responded by forcing up spreads on Spanish and Italian bonds. In America, Republicans and Democrats continued their game of chicken over raising US Federal borrowing limits. The US government needs to raise its mandatory dollars 1.3 trillion (GBP810 million) debt ceiling so it can borrow to... er, pay its existing debt commitments. No wonder S&P; and Moody's, the credit agencies, repeated warnings they will downgrade US creditworthiness. Of course, the Republicans and Democrats will do a deal - at the last minute, as always - and America won't default. That's not the point. America's unwillingness to agree a plan to reduce its debt mountain means a credit downgrade is inevitable. A downgrade will end US Treasury bills being the world's financial safe haven and send shockwaves through global investment markets. Equally, EU dithering over Greece has made a default - however managed, dressed-up or spun - inevitable. Even yesterday's European Central Bank (ECB) stress tests will not give the markets comfort. This latest ECB health check on Europe's main banks factors in only a 15 per cent haircut on Greek bonds. Perhaps 50 per cent would be nearer the mark. Why are politicians being so ham-fisted in dealing with sovereign debt? Western governments were seduced into borrowing in the nineties when cheap and seemingly boundless credit became available through a unique combination of financial deregulation and the withering of inflationary risks. But sovereign borrowing limits have been reached, inflation is back, and the interconnectedness of the new global financial system means that a fire in one part soon spreads to the rest. Now the game is up. America needs to raise taxes while Europe requires mandatory fiscal limits on any country staying in the eurozone. My hunch is this will only come after further credit downgrades persuade politicians we really are living in riskier times. Something Murdoch knows already. But there's Norway they will be suffering I've escaped the credit crisis for a holiday in sunny Norway. I'm in Bergen and the town is knee-deep in tourists from passing cruise ships, despite Norway's legendary high prices. The Norwegian economy is a paradox. Keeping its oil and gas wealth in state ownership has created national wealth and highly-paid domestic employment. For the past 35 years, Norway has assiduously invested its oil revenues in a sovereign wealth fund that now owns around 1 per cent of global equity markets. No sovereign debt crisis here. However, all is not green in the fjords. The main reason the Norwegian political class invests the country's oil wealth abroad is not out of an uncommon ability to think beyond winning the next election, but because it remains petrified of stoking inflation. The result is the handlingsregelen, a policy rule that limits use of oil revenues to 4 per cent of the total assets in the oil fund. On average only 11 per cent of national budget expenditures are funded from oil. But this means Norway has not used its oil wealth to invest in local infrastructure to world-class levels. Norway also has a labour market problem. Not only does it not have enough workers, but ethnic Norwegians remain wedded to a traditional lifestyle that prioritises family, weekends and holidays. True, Norwegians are ferociously hard-working. But they use their productivity to work fewer hours than the rest of us.Wage inflation would long since have wrecked the Norwegian economy but for the fact that there are now 500,000 foreign immigrants in a population of only 4.9 million. Which is why the Russian and American tourists in Bergen are being served by folk from Africa and Asia, while ethnic Norwegians are lying on a Spanish beach."
Terror returns to hit Norway,Norway,"News | At least 17 dead in attacks on Oslo and island youth camp Trapped on the island - dozens of youths forced to swim for their lives A METICULOUSLY planned terrorist attack hit Norway yesterday when a bomb blast in Oslo and a lone gunman killed at least 17 people in the country's worst atrocity since the Second World War. A devastating bomb ripped through the capital killing at least seven people close to the offices of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Hours later a gunman posing as a policeman rampaged through an island 20 miles away after infiltrating a youth camp organised by the ruling Labour party and attended by 600 people, some as young as 13. Campers fled as the gunman, confirmed as Anders Behring Breivik, 32, last night, fired at groups of youngsters. Many of them fled into the sea to try to escape and others scrambled to hide in the buildings and undergrowth. One witness said he saw at least 20 people lying dead in the water. The Norwegian gunman was wounded and is in custody. Initial suspicion fell on Islamist militants angered by Norway's military role in Afghanistan though the nationality of the gunman raised the possibility of an attack by far-right extremists or someone with a domestic agenda and possibly working on his own. Police said they did not believe that it was international terrorism, according to officials cited by Norwegian news agency NTB. The apparent targets, government buildings and a youth political rally, also pointed to a domestic grudge rather than the focus on mass casualties adopted by al-Qa'ida and other militant groups. The attacks - the deadliest in Western Europe since the 2005 London bombings which killed 52 people - were carefully planned. Police believe that the gunman was in Oslo before the bomb attack before heading to the island and tricking his way past security to get on to the island where the premier was thought to have been due to speak to the campers. According to a Norwegian TV station, he has links to domestic far-right groups. Mr Stoltenberg appeared to be a possible target of the attacks as the bomb exploded just outside his office, blowing out most of the windows in the multi-storey block. The prime minister was at home at the time of the attack and was not harmed. ""Co-workers have lost their lives today,"" he said. ""It's frightening. That's not how we want things in our country. But it's important that we don't let ourselves be scared. Because the purpose of that kind of violence is to create fear."" The army established a cordon around Oslo following the bomb attack that injured scores of people. The United States, European Union, NATO and the UK, all quickly condemned the bombing, which Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague called ""horrific"" and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen deemed a ""heinous act"". ""It's a reminder that the entire international community has a stake in preventing this kind of terror from occurring,"" President Barack Obama said. The central part of the city yesterday resembled a battlefield with dozens of windows blown out by the huge explosion while shell-shocked inhabitants and tourists wandered through broken glass and rubble, blood-smeared and bleeding from their wounds. Two people were badly wounded in the blast, police said. There was no warning given for the attack but the Norwegian authorities were yesterday reported to have only recently warned about the possibility of terrorist attacks because of the country's military role in Afghanistan. There were initial claims of responsibility for the attacks from Ansar al-Jihad al-Alami (the Helpers of the Global Jihad), according to Will McCants a terrorism analyst cited by The New York Times. But it could not be confirmed. Whoever was behind the attacks, Islamic fundamentalist internet forums were yesterday reported to have described the Oslo blast as ""cheering news"". One user was quoted as saying: ""Get your troops out of Afghanistan or you will see blood on the streets."" Since the publication of cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper five years ago, al-Qa'ida has declared its intention to carry out an act of revenge on a Scandinavian country. The centre of Oslo was rapidly sealed off by police because of fears of another blast, while bomb disposal experts scoured the area in search of possible bombs. ""Some people covered with blood are lying in the street. There is glass everywhere. It is total chaos. The windows of all the surrounding buildings have been blown out,"" said Igunn Andersen, an eyewitness and journalist with Norwegian public radio reporting from the scene. As the injured were being treated, reports detailed a second attack on the island of Utoya, some 20 miles to the northwest. Police said the gunman pulled out a gun and started firing into crowds of youths at the came. ""I saw a lot of people running and screaming so I ran to the nearest building and hid under a bed,"" Emilie Bersaas, 19, told Sky News. ""At one point the shooting was very, very close ... the people in the next room screamed really loud. We're all a bit shaken up right now because we don't know who is fine and who is not fine. I'm a little worried about my friends and the other people on the island."" Grethe Helen Larre told The Independent that she watched the drama from the mainland across the water from Utoya when she first heard the shooting. ""There were bodies hiding behind bushes. A lot of people were in the water. They were swimming and trying to get away,"" she said. Television images showed victims swimming from the beaches of the small island. Police teams were still searching the waters last night for people missing with the toll expected to rise. A Norwegian police official said there is at least one unexploded device at the youth camp The gunman is believed to have travelled to the island by boat. A guard Simen Braende Mortensen told VG newspaper that he saw a man aged in his 30s with a bulletproof vest and a uniform drive on to the boat. NORWAY’S LEADER * Jens Stoltenberg has been a key figure in the Norwegian Labour Party over the past 10 years, serving as Prime Minister three times. * His age, 52, his electoral success and his centre-left background have led to comparisons with Tony Blair. * His first stint as Prime Minister was short, lasting only a year until the next general election in 2001. But his reformist approach to social welfare proved unpopular with voters. * He returned as Prime Minister in 2005, promising to improve Norway's already healthy public services. His coalition government has used a growing oil price to maintain Norway's high standards of life. * Since 2005, Stoltenberg has committed Norway to pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan. It currently has almost 700 soldiers in the NATO-led ISAF force."
An insular country that was clinging to its idyll; Commentary,Norway,"NORWAY IS like a heartachingly beautiful village the size of a country, with a quality of life, wealth and social equality that few in Britain could dream of. But this idyll — repeatedly recognised by the United Nations as the best country on Earth to live — has been utterly, incomprehensibly shattered. The four million Norwegians are flag-wavingly proud of their country, and proud above all of doing good in the world. They are always the peace-brokers and peacekeepers, the givers of Nobel Prizes, the biggest donors of foreign aid per capita on the planet. Unlike most European countries, they are unencumbered by any national or imperial guilt. It is a country of incredible trust, where King Harald proudly rides the Oslo tram alongside his subjects, and where crime is so low that people often don't lock their doors. When, as a small child, I got lost in Oslo with my brother and sister, it didn't really matter — strangers are never a threat, but a helping hand. There is no class system. It has such a generous welfare state, it is basically impossible to be poor. In short, it is difficult to think of a place less likely to suffer the worst mass shooting in history — nor a place more likely to have its innocence shattered by it. If the killer had been a foreigner — an utlendling — they might have found it more easily explicable. But a blond Norwegian farmer? What has happened to the country? Today, I am going to a huge family reunion in Norway, which includes a cousin who felt the blast of the bomb in her suburban Oslo home. I know the country I arrive in will be very different from the one I have known all my life — and the one where my father met my Norwegian mother half a century ago. Norwegians are not normally given to anguished introspection about their nation. The annual UN report singing its praises is greeted with a shrug of the shoulders, because they are all conscious that they have been living in an astonishing golden age. For most of its history, Norway was under the control of Sweden or Denmark, with Norwegians very much second-class citizens. Even after independence — celebrated with fervour every year — the country was still poor and isolated, with little but fish to live off. Things weren't helped by the Nazi occupation, during which my grandfather was imprisoned for working for the resistance. So until the 1960s, Norway was a poor, backwards country. Then it struck oil, and never looked back. The government's main budget problem is what to do with its huge surpluses — apart from add to the vast sovereign wealth fund built up for its citizens. Billions of krone are spent on building long road tunnels through granite rock to tiny, remote communities. The electricity is all hydroelectric, but the power stations are buried tastefully inside the mountains. It is the most beautiful country in Europe, although it gets few tourists because its petrocurrency makes it excruciatingly expensive. Yet as the attacks show, the country has a dark side. Norwegians have, until very recently, had very little contact with the outside world - they couldn't afford to travel, and no one went to visit. In recent years, however, Norway started receiving immigration from around the world, and Islam has become the second biggest religion. Given Norway's homogenous insularity, the impact of such different cultures has been even bigger than it was in Britain in the 1960s. Casual racism is rife. Only in Norway have I heard someone order a taxi and request that the driver is white. News reports can display an unwitting racism that is shocking to British ears. There is a widespread unease about the way the country is changing, which even mainstream politicians play on, with antiimmigration rhetoric more inflammatory than anything you will hear in Britain. Many Norwegians don't want their idyll spoiled, by either joining the EU, or by turning multicultural — and it is this nativist side of the country that has now turned horrifyingly murderous. Clearly, Norway must confront its racist demons, in much the same way that Britain has. But the shock of the attack could also crystallise the fears of many Norwegians that they don't like the way the country is going, and actually spur antiimmigration sentiment. Either way, Norway's innocence has come to a tragic and horrifying end.

A culinary capital to relish; Alan Hamilton offers a taste of Stavanger in our final report,Norway,"Stavanger was once the capital of the Vikings before becoming the centre of Norway's herring fishery industry and its oil business. But now it stakes another claim — as the country's undisputed capital of gastronomy. The fourth largest city is also the most cosmopolitan, with almost one in 12 of its 120,000 population a foreigner, attracted largely by the black gold of the North Sea. Within a short walk of the charming centre, with its wooden houses and cobbled streets, more than 100 restaurants offer every imaginable cuisine, from Thai and classic French to Indian, Italian and American burgers. But in a country that catches or farms more than three times as much fish as the UK, there can be only one speciality. Stavanger's classic fish restaurant is the renowned Straen, with its comfortable early 20th-century interior, where diners can sample the exotic lutefisk — dried whitefish which has been soaked in potash and is much enjoyed by (some) Norwegians at Christmas. Those who prefer more conventional and wondrously fresh seafood, accompanied by fresh vegetables from Norway's most productive farmland near by, will find Straen expensive but no more so than, say, Rick Stein's seafood restaurant at Padstow; in both cases main courses hover on the upper side of £30. First settled 10,000 years ago, Stavanger's location on the same latitude as John O'Groats is infinitely more attractive than a major port and industrial centre deserves to be. It is set between long sandy beaches and the soaring hinterland of mountains and fjords, and attracts about 100 cruise ships every year, daily disgorging tourists by the thousand. They come for the scenery but also for the charm of the city itself, with its traditional Scandinavian architecture, its 12th-century cathedral, its large and small festivals and to hear the renowned Stavanger Symphony Orchestra. The city is also home to a fascinating array of museums, two of which you will not find in many other cities. The Norwegian Canning Museum, housed in a old cannery, tells the story of what was a huge industry a century ago, when the northern seas swarmed with herring. Every Tuesday and Thursday visitors can taste sprats straight from the smoking ovens. The oil museum explains Stavanger's modern wealth and how Norway is now one of the world's top oil exporters; it has the added attraction of a fine brasserie. The city is also a good starting point to explore the country's heritage, with the Viking Village at Avaldsnes a little more than an hour's drive to the north. Good food is never far away, even though Stavanger's annual food festival has just finished. Only a 20-minute boat ride away is Flor & Fjaere, a botanic garden filled with exotic plants and palm trees, where André, the resident chef, rounds off your guided tour with an offering of the finest seafood. Stavanger nights may be short at this time of year but being a city of oilmen, students and fun-seeking Norwegians of all ages it has a vibrant nightlife with bars to suit all tastes. There is, needless to say, an Irish theme pub, but that chimes perfectly with the city's heritage. Dublin, after all, was founded by Vikings."
"Jeg elsker dere', it said in Norwegian - 'I love you all'; These were the last words texted by Nick meo reports from Alsund, Norway",Norway,"The conversation was brief and reassuring, a father phoning his son an hour after the massive explosion in faraway Oslo. ""Sverre said, 'Don't worry, Dad, everything is OK here,' "" recalls Bjarte Bjorkavag, a stocky, grey-haired 54-year-old who has just been through the worst week of his life. ""Those were the last words of his that I ever heard. ""After the bomb, we didn't think for a minute that there was anything to worry about. It's just your instinct as a parent to check at a time like that and we were all in shock after the bombing. This is Norway. Bad things like that don't happen here. ""He was a long way from Oslo, safe on the island at camp. We talked for a minute about how he was going to get home the next day, with all the travel disruption there was bound to be."" Sitting in his airy living room, full of flowers from sympathisers, Mr Bjorkavag, a civil servant, is remembering his boy, and explaining in heavily accented English how his very ordinary Norwegian family has been touched by an extraordinary evil. Sverre grew up in the neat weatherboard family home, with antlers mounted above the door and a magnificent view from the living room of a peaceful fjord below and forest-covered mountains beyond. Generations of his family have lived in the village. Although Sverre was aged 28, he still had a self-contained flat in the family home, and he ate his meals in the kitchen with his mother and two younger brothers, Tore and Ivar. Such an arrangement is typical in the closeknit rural communities of the region, eight hours' drive north of Oslo. Their little village is just outside the city of Alesund, population 40,000, famous for its cod-fishing port and for the cruise ships that stop there. It is a place where nothing much ever happens; a traditional community, one of the wealthiest in Europe with fish, oil, tourism and forestry supporting an enviable lifestyle in a pristine environment. Like most Norwegians, its population enjoys almost full employment. They have big cars, lakeside holiday homes, and holidays abroad to escape Norway's cold winters. In the town's neat shops and cosy cafés, staff are without fail polite and friendly. Gun sprees, political madness and bomb plots were horrors that only happened in faraway countries. In Alesund itself crime is so unusual that few people think of locking their doors at night, and murder is almost unknown. Yet this week the district is mourning three young people who died in the shooting on Utoya island, and another killed in the bombing in Oslo city centre. One of them is Mr Bjorkavag's son. For weeks beforehand, Sverre had been looking forward to spending five days on the island, where he spoke at a meeting for his union and mingled with old friends in the Labour party whom he had met at previous camps. The Sunday Telegraph presented his father with what is probably the last photo taken of Sverre, at an outdoors meeting on the island the day before the massacre (pictured above left). It shows a giant of a man with a round, cherubic face, sitting at the back of a huge, happy crowd gathered in the bright sunshine. Sverre is unmistakeable, and the family look at the photograph with delight. ""That's my boy,"" Mr Bjorkavag says, grinning hugely. Still, the strain of the past week is etched on his face, and on that of his wife Torild Flate, 53, a primary school teacher. On the day of the attacks, after the quick phone call to their son, they went back to watching television like the rest of the nation, and were horrified when a newsflash told of a gun attack on Utoya. About 20 minutes later, a text message flashed up from Sverre. ""Shooting here, we are running, hiding on the lakeshore."" They decided not to respond, fearing that they could distract him or that a beeping phone could give him away. About 20 minutes later, there was one more text message, the one that they will always remember. ""Jeg elsker dere"", it said in Norwegian - ""I love you all"". It was clear from the message that Sverre believed he was in terrible danger, but his family, hundreds of miles away, hoped against hope that somehow he would not be among the victims, reported late on Friday night as 10 out of 650 young people at the summer camp. They tried to call but his phone did not answer. As Friday night turned into Saturday, and the death toll jumped from 10 to 80, real fear started to take hold. ""We hoped he was in a hospital somewhere, or had lost his phone. Or we thought he was too busy helping others to call us - he was a nurse, and trained in first aid, and it would be typical of him,"" says his father. ""He was an idealist who always thought of others before himself."" Gradually, as the day wore on, his parents realised their son had probably been killed. But when a list of wounded was made available to the families of those who had been on the island, his name was not on it. It wasn't until last Thursday that police were finally able to confirm what the family already knew; their son was dead. Police have told them that he was shot, and did not drown like so many of the young people who tried to swim to safety in the lake's freezing waters. Sverre's parents have asked police not to tell them details of how he died yet, because it would be too upsetting. ""He was a big man and brave,"" says his father. ""I am sure he died trying to shield others from the gunman. It must have been terrible for him at the end, as it was for all of them; they must have had a terrible fear."" The family have tried to avoid reading the harrowing descriptions from survivors of how the gunman methodically hunted down terrified teenagers, shooting them and laughing as he did so. Hours earlier, the young people had been enjoying themselves, looking forward to a summer of parties, or planning careers and lives. The family cannot, however, stop themselves from guessing enough about their son's end for it to haunt their nightmares. ""Nobody should have to go through that fear,"" says Mr Bjorkavag. They plan to pay a private visit to Utoya after the funeral on Friday. ""I'm sure it will be hard to be there. But perhaps it will help us."" At least Sverre left behind plenty of happy memories for his family from his short life. He spent a happy boyhood with a group of six close friends from the village, fishing and hiking in the lakes and hills around their home. His life had drifted aimlessly for a while after he finished his compulsory national service, then he got a job as a psychiatric nurse. It gave him a purpose and he found that he loved helping people. His family are proud that he chose a tough job. He was devoted to his patients, and befriended local teenagers with problems. People in his community looked up to him. Joining the union led him into local politics, not out of personal ambition but because he wanted to try to shape a better world. It was a very Norwegian ambition, in a nation that values idealism above all else. ""He was a rock for his community, and a good friend to his colleagues at work,"" says his father. On Friday night there was a memorial service for Sverre. Three hundred people crammed into the tiny village church: elderly neighbours, Sverre's friends and colleagues, and families with young children. There was a long queue to sign the condolence book and the church was so full they had to put chairs in the entrance hall. Discussing the murderer, Breivik, is difficult for his family, as it is for many people with links to the island. One survivor told The Sunday Telegraph last week that he would not utter his name, and others have expressed deep concerns that Breivik's massacre has won him the publicity in the world's press that he clearly craved. Sverre's parents say they have avoided thinking deeply about the gunman. ""We don't understand him,"" says his mother. ""There is something missing in him,"" adds her husband. At one point in the conversation he refers to Breivik as ""that devil"", but his wife quickly shushes him. As she later explains, she is determined not to show anger. ""We have to learn from what happened to engage more, to care more about each other instead of being angry, so the world can be a better place,"" she says. ""Perhaps that can stop people like Breivik who are on their own, who develop the kind of thoughts he did."" Her husband adds: ""In the pictures, he doesn't look like a healthy man. I am worried that there will be other people who feel inspired by Breivik."" They are the kind of strong family that has been able to find something positive in all the pain they have been through. ""We have had so much support. People have been so kind, our friends and neighbours and even total strangers."" Sverre's mother says she feels no anger for Anders Breivik, even as she prepares for her son's funeral next Friday. ""I don't want the legacy of those idealistic young people to be anger - that's what drove the killer,"" she says. ""Instead, we want the world to know that the young people on Utoya were innocent. Their example should be an inspiration for us. Making the world a better place, as they wanted, should be their legacy. That is what Norwegians are determined to do now."" The family's grief has been terrible. They know worse is to come in the next few weeks as the tragedy of what happened really hits them. But they are Norwegians, and they still have an unshakeable faith in the essential goodness of human nature. Breivik may have murdered their son, and rocked their happy, safe nation to its core. But he has not been able to take that away from them. ""He was a big man and brave. I am sure he died trying to shield others from the gunman"

Through icy waters,Norway,"Ateam of Canadian archaeologists and oceanographers will mount a fresh search next week to solve a great mystery of the British empire: what fate befell the 19th-century expedition led by Sir John Franklin in search of the North-West Passage ? When Sir John and his 134-man crew set sail from Greenhithe, England, in 1845, hopes were high that they would open a new trade route between Europe and Asia, returning with a cornucopia of zoological, botanical and geological discoveries. Their instructions were to sail home across the Pacific Ocean. But their two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, disappeared months later among the maze of islands and sea channels that dot the Canadian Arctic . Neither wreckage nor the men's remains has been found. Yet the promise of the Franklin expedition is now being fulfilled in a dramatic way. Global warming is rapidly expanding access to the North-West Passage as well as to other parts of the Arctic region, not only opening trade routes but providing access to a treasure trove of natural resources. Louis Fortier, scientific director of ArcticNet, a network of Canadian researchers based at Laval University in Quebec City, says ""things are moving much faster than I expected in the Arctic, whether we're talking about climate warming or industrialisation or the difficulties in the physical and mental health of the Inuit"". The transformation of the once inaccessible north is raising tricky strategic, legal and logistical issues, especially for the five nations - Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US - with jurisdiction over all the Arctic's land and much of its water. Indigenous people of the area also face wrenching economic and social changes to their already threatened traditional way of life. According to Michael Byers, international law professor at the University of British Columbia, ""at the moment there's an extraordinary amount of co-operation. That does give me some optimism"". However, Prof Byers adds: ""It is possible that this move towards co-operation could be derailed. From time to time, the politicians of Arctic countries, most notably Russia and Canada, seek to mislead their publics by reaching for old nationalist symbols and sentiments concerning Arctic sovereignty. The contrast between what is said in public and what happens in private is sometimes quite stark."" The Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first to succeed where Franklin had failed in threading his way through the North-West Passage. In the first 100 years after Amundsen's 1906 voyage, just 69 vessels followed in his wake. Yet the same number completed the trip in the five years from 2006 to 2010, not counting numerous private mega-yachts that are thought to have followed one of several routes now free of ice during the summer months. The long coast of northern Siberia has become even busier. In 2009 Russian authorities began to charge fees on vessels using the northern route to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific. With the ice cap receding , ship operators are now eyeing an even more northerly route across the North Pole that would shave as much as 7,000km off the existing sailing distance between Rotterdam and Tokyo via the Suez Canal. Two German cargo vessels, helped by icebreakers, completed the short polar voyage in 2009. Experts caution, however, that even though the top of the world is becoming more accessible, it may be at least two decades before these routes are widely used. Despite global warming, the Arctic remains an inhospitable environment, marked not only by severe cold and months of darkness but far away from search and rescue facilities and other amenities. Icebergs and high insurance costs will also make shipowners think twice. Yet such risks have not dampened interest in the Arctic's vast untapped resources. The US Geological Survey, a government agency, estimates 13 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and almost a third of natural gas deposits lie under the Arctic. Several western European energy companies have eyed acquisitions and joint ventures in northern Russia as a way of gaining access to untapped oil and gas reserves. For example, BP acquired a stake this year in Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, which has extensive interests in the region. Elsewhere, a bidding war erupted last winter for a big iron ore deposit being developed south of Pond Inlet on Canada's Baffin Island, about 700km north of the Arctic Circle. ArcelorMittal, the steelmaker, ended up paying $590m for a 70 per cent stake. Fish from the Arctic are set to emerge as a huge resource, but also a potential source of friction. Experts predict mass migration of marine life to warming Arctic waters, coupled with the growing shortage of fish elsewhere, will attract trawlers from Japan, South Korea and China, among others. ""The barriers to commercial fishing are falling pretty rapidly,"" says Scott Highleyman, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' international Arctic programme, based in Bellingham, Washington state. Trawlers could appear around the Chukchi Plateau, north-west of Alaska, within the next five years, he predicts. A Chinese vessel has already conducted marine research in the area. Michel Rocard, a former French prime minister and now the country's ambassador for polar affairs, foresees ""a splendid conflict"" between coastal states and non-Arctic fishing nations. The US closed its Arctic waters to industrial fishing in late 2009. Pew, among others, is now urging Canada, Russia and the US to spearhead a multilateral agreement that would limit fishing in international waters, stretching over an area the size of the Mediterranean Sea. Such a pact would underline the international collaboration that has so far marked the opening up of the Arctic. ""The Arctic is not a wild west zone,"" Prof Byers says. ""It's not a place of conflict or threat of conflict."" The only land in dispute in the region is a tiny uninhabited island off Greenland claimed by both Denmark and Canada. Prof Byers dismisses this dispute and Russia's much-publicised move in 2007 to plant a flag in the seabed far below the North Pole as ""mostly domestic political noise"". Co-operation in managing the region's development took a big step forward in 1996 with the creation of the eight-nation Arctic Council . (Members comprise the five Arctic countries plus Finland, Iceland and Sweden.) According to Mr Rocard, the council ""is the place where Russia co-operates best with the rest of the world"". A reason for its success, Mr Highleyman says, is the inclusion of six indigenous groups from across the region as ""permanent participants"". The council agreed this year to set up a permanent secretariat in Tromsø, Norway, and its members signed a binding search and rescue treaty. But as Arctic issues take on a higher profile with more scope for friction, Mr Highleyman says that ""everybody is watching to see whether [the council] changes into a different kind of body"". The pursuit of national interest is never far below the surface. Canada, with tacit support from Denmark, has blocked an application by the European Union for permanent observer status on the council because of the EU's stand against seal hunting, a staple of indigenous communities. Norway moved its military command centre last year to Bodø, just inside the Arctic Circle. Russia unveiled plans in June to create two army brigades to defend its polar territory. Stephen Harper , Canada's prime minister, has made the Arctic a signature issue since his Conservative party took office in 2006, repeatedly asserting that ""we either use it or lose it"". The Tories' campaign platform in last year's election asserted: "" Canada's north is at the heart of our Canadian identity . . . Our presence in Canada's north is also an increasingly important factor in defending our national sovereignty"". A small tent city has sprung up this month near the hamlet of Resolute on Cornwallis Island for Canada's biggest-ever military exercise in the north, involving about 1,200 troops. In a sign of the Arctic's growing accessibility, the operation includes a simulated rescue of passengers stranded on a grounded cruise ship. The Arctic nations are also pushing to expand their offshore economic zones beyond the 200-mile limit traditionally recognised under international law. Article 76 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea allows states to claim rights up to 350 miles offshore if the geology of the seabed indicates a ""natural prolongation"" of the continental shelf. Applications are vetted by a group of scientists. Norway has already secured an extension, Russia has applied for one and Canada is preparing an application. Mr Byers predicts that some of the claims could overlap. The co-operation that has marked Arctic issues so far is also in evidence in next week's search for the remains of the Franklin expedition. Parks Canada, a government agency coordinating the effort, will use an unmanned submarine for the first time, concentrating on an area around Victoria Strait and the west coast of King William Island, about 700km north of the Arctic Circle. While the UK theoretically still owns the Erebus and the Terror, it has told Ottawa that if the ships are found, it will lay claim only to any gold bullion on board. It also wants human remains to be treated with appropriate respect. As Andrew Pocock, the UK high commissioner in Ottawa, puts it: ""Both sides trust each other to behave in an honest and straightforward manner."" The question is whether that spirit will continue to apply as the dossier of more weighty Arctic issues grows thicker. 'Worse and more complex than we imagined' Michel Bourdeau, captain of the Canadian coastguard ship Amundsen, spotted tourists this month kayaking close to his ship off the coast of Pond Inlet, 800km north of the Arctic Circle. ""You wouldn't have seen that 20 years ago,"" Mr Bourdeau says. According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the surface area of the Arctic ice pack shrank to a record low of 7.92m sq km in July, 22 per cent less than the 1979-2000 average and beneath its previous low set in 2007, one of the warmest years on record. A slight recovery in recent weeks has brought it back a little above that level. But the centre warned on Tuesday that ""Arctic ice extent is again declining at a brisk pace . . . With about a month left in the sea ice melt season, the amount of further ice loss will depend mostly on weather patterns."" John Smol, a biologist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, uses an everyday metaphor to explain why climate change is wreaking more damage on the Arctic than on just about any other part of the world. Put your hands on a white car and a black car in a parking lot on a summer's day, he says. The black one is hotter because it has a lower albedo, or surface reflectivity, causing it to absorb more of the sun's energy. ""Arctic lands and oceans, covered in snow and ice, are like the white car - a high albedo and reflecting the sun,"" Mr Smol says. ""Once we start warming the Arctic and start melting the snow and ice it becomes more like the black car. It absorbs even more heat, gets hotter and melts even more snow and ice."" Arctic research has grown as the global warming threat has become more apparent. Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Sweden and the US among others now operate icebreakers devoted mainly to scientific work. The Amundsen, operating in conjunction with ArcticNet, a research network based at Laval University in Quebec City, takes 42 scientists to the Arctic each summer. Its equipment includes a remote-controlled subsea vehicle that can collect samples as far as 2km below the surface. Mr Smol says his research suggests that ""things are generally worse and more complicated than we initially imagined"". Wetlands in the Arctic that were once carbon sinks have turned into producers of greenhouse gases. Using sediment samples, Mr Smol and his colleagues have tracked a dramatic evaporation of ponds in the high Arctic that were permanent water bodies for thousands of years but are now dry. Higher precipitation has been no match for faster evaporation caused by rising temperatures. The warming atmosphere has also triggered a ""grasshopper effect"" transporting toxic substances, such as mercury and pesticides, from the south. Mr Smol has found that even seabirds - of which there are an estimated 10m in the Canadian Arctic alone - have contributed to the pollution by bringing contaminants from the south. Melting glaciers and permafrost are another source of contaminants."
Airport lands new link to the fjords of Norway,Norway,"GLASGOW Airport is to offer flights to Stavanger in Norway from next month. The new destination will be serviced by Eastern Airways, who will operate three flights a week to the Scandinavian city, a hub for the oil and gas industry. Kay Ryan, Eastern Airways’ commercial director, said: “A new convenient route to Stavanger from Glasgow will not only benefit offshore workers who live in central Scotland, but also Norwegian contractors and businesses with links in Glasgow and the surrounding region. We will monitor the service and look to increase frequency if there’s high demand for more flights.” Amanda McMillan, managing director at Glasgow Airport said, “We are absolutely thrilled to welcome Eastern Airways to Glasgow. “The new route is fantastic news for leisure travellers who would like to visit Norway’s spectacular fjords and waterfalls and for business travellers who want easier access to Stavanger, one of Europe’s most important oil and gas capitals. “I look forward to working with the team at Eastern and wish the airline great success for the future.” Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau said: “This is fantastic news for Glasgow and our airport. The Stavanger service adds yet another valuable route to our network of flights around the world and is a boost for both business and the short break tourist market. Even in these tough times Glasgow is constantly improving its air links and we will continue to work hard to build on this latest success.” Norway is one of the largest exporters of oil in the world and most major energy companies have bases in Stavanger on the country’s south west coast. The new Stavanger service, which will begin on September 12, will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Fares will start from £99 one way, including taxes and charges. Monday and Wednesday flights will leave Stavanger at 9.20am and arrive in Glasgow at 9.50am Services on Mondays and Wednesdays will depart Glasgow at 10.20am and arrive in Stavanger at 1.20pm. On Fridays, flights will depart Stavanger at 10am and arrive in Glasgow at 10.30pm. Friday services take off from Glasgow at 11am and land in Stavanger at 1.30pm. Although the new service will suit business travellers, as a former European Capital of Culture, with breath-taking fjords and mountains, the Stavanger region is also an ideal destination for tourists. ewan.fergus@ eveningtimes.co.uk ‘"
The struggle for Greenland's oil,Norway,"Downtown Nuuk on a rainy evening in July has the air of a town wanting to be somewhere else. Cars wait patiently at the town's two traffic lights while teenagers on BMX bikes ride aimlessly round the shopping precinct. The temperature hovers around 10C, the leaden skies touched by the faint hue of the midnight sun. It is high summer in the capital of Greenland, 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle. On the streets, Inuit traders display their wares in cardboard boxes, selling anything from cut-price DVDs to fur hats. Large Soviet-style apartment blocks loom up behind - reminders of a misguided attempt in the 1950s and 1960s to urbanise the country's population. Towards the old harbour and the rocky fringes of the grassy shoreline, wooden, two-storey houses painted blue, red and yellow are dots of colour in the grey. All this could be about to change. About 750km north-west of Nuuk, out to sea, a Scottish company is drilling for oil. Greenland, the world's largest island, with its tiny population of 56,000, is standing on the brink of an oil rush. The potential wealth that lies off its shores is turning the country - an empty wilderness three times the size of Texas - into a battleground. The global oil industry, striving to feed the world's hunger for energy, is engaged in a struggle against environmental groups who believe that this delicate Arctic landscape should remain untouched. A spill in such cold waters, they warn, would be calamitous, not least for fishing, currently Greenland's main source of domestic income. But that fear must compete with the hope, shared by some of the biggest players in the energy industry, that the sea floor around Greenland holds one of the world's largest remaining undiscovered oil finds. In 2008, a study of the basins of the Arctic by the US Geological Survey estimated that three provinces off the coast of Greenland combined could yield up to 52 billion barrels of oil equivalent (which includes natural gas) - as much as has been drilled out of the North Sea in the past 40 years. This caught the attention of companies including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, and it is why Scotland's Cairn Energy is now prospecting there. The numbers also stuck in the mind of Kuupik Kleist, Greenland's prime minister and leader of the country's Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Kleist sees oil as a possible way finally to achieve Greenland's economic independence. Although self-governing since 2009, the country remains a dependency of Denmark. Each year the island receives an annual subsidy of about DKK3.2bn (£375m) from Denmark, which helps fund social services. The export of fish brings in revenues of about DKK2bn (£235m). Everything else is imported. The irony of Greenland becoming a major producer of hydrocarbons, and contributing to the climate change that is helping to melt its own glaciers, is not lost on Kleist. But the root of the problem, he says, is in the failure of the rest of the world to curb its appetite for energy. ""The western press is focusing on whether Greenland should or should not exploit its natural resources,"" he says. ""They don't focus on the consumption of energy."" The country's potential hydrocarbon wealth ""holds a very big economic potential,"" says Kleist. He is sitting at an elegant glass table in his office in the centre of Nuuk. Dressed in an unprepossessing blue T-shirt and jumper - he is about to go on his summer holiday (""hunting and fishing"") - Kleist does not give the impression of a man burdened by what critics describe as a Faustian pact with the oil industry. For him, the argument is clear: the government wants to diversify the economy, and oil and gas present an enormous opportunity. Kleist also rejects opinions from abroad about what he regards as Greenland's sovereign prerogative to exploit its resources. ""We claim our right to economic development,"" he says, ""and we claim our right to be independent from former colonial powers."" Although oil has not yet been found in commercial quantities, Greenland's government has set up a sovereign wealth fund similar to Norway's. It would hold revenues in trust for the nation. Denmark, Kleist explains, has no claim to any oil revenues. He says he is well aware that rapid wealth can bring risks, especially to a society that has been provided for from the outside for what he describes as ""a very long time and for too long a time"". If his vision is clear, the future does not appear quite as straightforward to the country's mostly Inuit inhabitants. Inuits make up some 85 per cent of the population of Greenland - the rest are Danes - and while there appears to be broad local support for the oil industry, particularly its revenues, many are wary of moving too quickly. Blowing bubbles for his baby daughter while waiting for the bus, Uusaqqak Kristensen, a 32-year-old school teacher, says the arrival of the energy industry is ""the start of something"" for Greenland. Investment in infrastructure is badly needed. Henrik Leth, general manager of the Employers' Association of Greenland, agrees, but he also wants to see new work opportunities for local inhabitants. There is already a sharp disparity between the incomes of Greenlanders and those who come from overseas to work in the Arctic for a year or two. Leth worries that the lack of relevant skills among Greenlanders means they could become mere ""spectators"" amid the oil rush. The country's leaders, he says, are seeing ""only the money part of it"" and should force international energy companies to make a lasting investment in the local workforce. The government insists it is doing this. Cairn Energy, for instance, has signed an ""impact benefit agreement"", under which it must invest a certain amount in the local economy. Leth remains cautious: ""If we don't do it right, it's a failure, no matter what happens."" . . . It is a month earlier, late June, and huddled above the engine room of the Esperanza, a Greenpeace vessel floating some 80 miles off the coast of Greenland, 18 activists are about to embark on ""Operation Foreigner"". Frank Hewetson, also known as The Colonel, raises a hand for silence. ""The swell is significant, so I want you to mentally prepare yourselves for the ladders,"" he says. ""Just don't slip."" Seventeen volunteers beam back at him, alight with nerves. They are the other face of Greenland's energy rush. Among the professional eco-types (unkempt facial hair, socks, sandals) are an anthropologist, a sous-chef and a professional bass guitarist. ""It's a lifelong activist's dream to be on a Greenpeace ship like this,"" says Iris Cheng, an environmental policy co-ordinator from Hong Kong. The group - all dressed in orange, body-hugging dry suits - waddle down the Esperanza's port side on a rope ladder. Negotiating the rise and fall of the frigid ocean below, they drop into dinghies. Some 15 minutes later a sleepy voice crackles over the Esperanza's radio. It is a policeman from Greenland onboard a battleship charged with maintaining a 500m exclusion zone around the Leiv Eiriksson, one of the exploration rigs hired by Cairn Energy for the summer drilling season. He says the activists - who by this point are climbing the rig's steel legs - are breaking the law. He orders the captain to call them back. Madeleine Habib, the Esperanza's silver-haired captain, politely dismisses the request. ""What do you expect us to do?"" she says. ""Sit around and sing 'Kumbaya'?"" Officially, the Greenpeace activists are storming the rig to search for Cairn's ""spill response plan"" - a mandatory document that sets out what action an oil company will take in the event of a spill - and which Greenpeace says was initially not being made public by the Greenlandic government. The protest, or ""non-violent direct action"" in Greenpeace jargon, is the largest the organisation has staged at sea and part of what it has called ""the defining environmental battle of our age"". For international climate-change campaigners, drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic is the final insult. ""We are drawing a line in the ice,"" says Nick Young, a volunteer and blogger from New Zealand. ""If we see the melting of the ice caps as an opportunity to drill for oil, then what hope is there?"" A showdown in Greenland is also a welcome fillip for an organisation, which, for the past 15 years, has struggled with fluctuating membership and accusations that on its journey from the fringe to the mainstream it has lost some of its pioneering spirit. The Arctic's melting seascape provides the perfect backdrop for a revival: for many Greenpeace is still associated with its campaigns to protect whales and seals in the 1970s and 1980s. ""It's a return to our roots,"" says Ben Ayliffe, a senior campaigner for Greenpeace. ""And you have it in an area which tugs on people's heartstrings. They understand its beauty and the threat companies like Cairn pose. It's classic David and Goliath."" Not that, financially speaking, Greenpeace is a puny opponent. The group has an annual budget of €206m, out of which it has been able to rent a helicopter for the use of the media to cover its activities in Greenland, and pay the €16,000-a-day necessary to keep the Esperanza and its sister ship, Arctic Sunrise, out at sea. The activists' ambition is to take the fight to all corners of the high Arctic. ""We're not just bearded blokes in inflatable boats,"" says John Sauven, Greenpeace's executive director in London. He likens the group's direct action in Greenland to throwing a stone into a pond. ""There's a ripple effect. It makes conversations happen and the risk-factor [for oil companies] climbs dramatically."" . . . Many of the risks, of course, have always been there. The Arctic oil rush has been a long time coming. Since 1945, more than 10,500 wells, onshore and offshore, have been drilled within the Arctic Circle, with Russia responsible for most of the exploratory wells. Greenland granted its first offshore licences as far back as the 1970s. Five wells were drilled, as well as one more in 2000, but none was successful. Interest dried up and the remaining licences were surrendered in 2001. The government came up with a new plan, and the result - a map showing the 20 licences the country has since awarded - is displayed at its Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum in Nuuk. Jørn Skov Nielsen, the Danish deputy minister at the bureau, explains what changed. In 2001, the government decided to woo the oil and gas industry by holding more regular licensing rounds and using public money to buy seismic data and to commission environmental impact studies. Licence rounds followed in 2002 and 2004. But the real breakthrough came in 2006-2007, when the government offered licences in Greenland's northern Disko-Nuussuaq region, attracting the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron and Canada's Husky Energy. The lure is now such that last May - as anxiety over the dangers of offshore drilling reached its height during BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill - Greenland received more than 17 applications for its Baffin Bay area. The companies included ConocoPhillips, Shell and Cairn. And what is happening in Greenland is only part of the story. The Arctic is hot. BP's proposed alliance with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company that collapsed in May, was about getting the group into the Russian Arctic. Shell is next year hoping to drill exploration wells in Alaska's Beaufort Sea. Statoil, the Norwegian state-controlled group, already has a project in the Barents Sea. Twelve offshore wells have been drilled in the Arctic since 2010. The physical challenges are immense. Drilling can only take place in the summer months when the ice has melted. There is little infrastructure and wells are expensive. But today's rush is supported by oil prices of more than $100 a barrel. It is no surprise to find Cairn Energy in the race. The company has form: founded by Sir Bill Gammell, a former Scotland rugby international and childhood friend of former US President George W Bush, Cairn struck oil in India at a field where Shell had previously failed to find anything. In 2002, Cairn bought Shell's 50 per cent share in the concession for a mere $7.25m before hitting the jackpot and becoming a FTSE100 company almost over night. The three wells Cairn drilled off Greenland last summer failed to find commercial quantities of oil and gas but showed signs of their presence. The programme this summer, which is supported by a fleet of four helicopters, six ice-management vessels to help tow icebergs out of the path of the drilling rigs and two emergency response ships, will cost $600m. Earlier this month, Cairn announced its fourth well was also dry but said it remains undeterred. The company insists that despite the high costs, drilling off Greenland will be economical even at lower oil prices. A discovery that yields 500 million barrels would turn a profit from prices of $40 a barrel, they say, while anything from 250 million barrels would make money at $60 a barrel. It is a huge exercise in logistics. Every 28 days, the company transports dozens of workers and contractors from its base in Edinburgh to Greenland and then on to its two drilling rigs, the Leiv Eiriksson and the Corcovado. As soon as the workers land in Nuuk, they are given a safety briefing in a hangar that belongs to the airport's fire service. A well-thumbed copy of a thriller, Blowout, about a drilling ship that is sabotaged and then spills millions of gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean, lies on one of the tables. Experienced oil workers are in demand in Greenland, and their time is precious. After a cup of tea or coffee, they are searched to make sure they are taking nothing illicit offshore - workers must be teetotal during their stay - and then it is into a survival suit before taking a helicopter to the rig. Out in the vastness of the Arctic, the only activity is the never-ending rhythm of the rig's operations. The Greenpeace protest in June was an extremely rare interruption. Simon Thomson, Cairn's CEO, says that he respects the right of the campaigners to express their opinion, but the company objects when ""the way that voicing is expressed potentially compromises safety"". As a result, Cairn now has an injunction in a Dutch court against Greenpeace, which forbids activists from disrupting its operations and breaking through the exclusion zone surrounding its ships. More broadly, Thomson insists that Cairn is doing nothing wrong. The company works in strict accordance with Greenland's safety standards, which are modelled on Norway's. It is employing two rigs. In the event of an accident on the seabed, the second rig is on hand to drill a relief well, which would intersect with the damaged well and pump cement down it. The company also has insurance and sufficient funding to deal with any potential incidents, he claims. In his Nuuk office, Nielsen, the deputy minister, is equally adamant that Greenland's safety rules are among the toughest in the world and insists much of Cairn's oil spill response plan is public. But Greenpeace can claim to be making an impression. In August, Cairn's plan - whose absence from public view was the official pretext for the protest in June - was published in full by the government. The government said it was able to publish full details after tighter legal restrictions were imposed on how close campaigners can go to the drilling rigs. The role of Greenpeace in Greenland remains complicated. Mikkel Myrup, the chairman of Avataq, a local environment group, says that his 50 members have a more nuanced attitude towards the oil industry than international pressure groups. Myrup, who works as a curator at Greenland's National Museum and Archives, says his group is not absolutely opposed to Cairn's drilling, rather that it has sparked ""a different kind of awareness about what this exploration could mean for the environment and marine life"". Greenpeace, in particular, makes for an unlikely ally. Myrup credits the group with making ""some good points"" in its campaign against Cairn, but the group is generally disliked in Greenland. Its opposition to the seal trade in the 1980s had a big impact on people's livelihoods. More important, says Myrup, is ""for this young democracy to have a qualified discussion about the issues"". . . . The sun has finally broken through the clouds and Nuuk shows its brighter side. The centre is bustling with shoppers. Groups of middle-aged tourists just off a cruise ship and dressed in the latest outdoor gear, wander through the streets taking pictures. But the debate about Greenland's oil-based future goes on. In his office overlooking the harbour, Alfred Jakobsen, managing director of the country's Organisation of Fishermen and Hunters, is poring over statistics. The organisation has recently commissioned research to compare its fish prices with those of competitors in Canada. Jakobsen says he is against offshore oil development, because ""you cannot control the environmental conditions"" and he worries about what a spill would do to his members' livelihoods. ""We don't know anything,"" he says. ""They send us lots of documents in English. We have to be given a chance to really listen to what this is all about and then consider."" Carl Christian Olsen, president of Greenland's Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), the international non-government organisation that represents around 150,000 Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Chukotka (Russia) and Greenland, is more optimistic. He says the government is recognising that it needs to take into account ""the view of the public society"". The ICC, he says, has been focused on emphasising ""a human dimension"" to the debate about drilling in the Arctic, not just the environmental one. These are the various conflicting demands that Greenland's new administration must find a way to accommodate. The premier, Kleist, remains pragmatic and he is one of the few who cautions that Greenland's oil dream remains just that. Executives at the major oil companies, meanwhile, are looking forward to the next licensing round, planned for early 2012, for sites off the island's north-east coast, now considered the most promising area. Whatever happens, says Kleist, Greenland will play a very significant role in shaping the politics of the Arctic, which, if nothing else, must put the people of the high north at the centre of their changing world. ""Now we are focusing on human beings more strongly,"" he says. ""We always had to yell, 'We are people living the Arctic'. Today, I think, the message has been received and understood.""

A love affair that is still going strong; Gabriella Le Breton focuses on Stavanger and the enduring appeal of the fjords,Norway,"Legend has it that British tourists first visited southwest Norway in 1870, inspired by the owner of a London gentlemen's club, who sourced clear blue ice from the glaciers with which to chill his drinks. Returning with tales of wildly beautiful fjords, white sand beaches and bountiful salmon fishing, his members followed in his footsteps. Britain's love affair with the region was cemented in 1875 when Thomas Cook launched a weekly cruise to the fjords, a trip that proved to be one of the most popular itineraries in the company's history. Britons still head for the fjords, with Stavanger the focus for many of them. Hugging a peninsula on the ruggedly beautiful southwest coast, Stavanger is known as the Pearl of Norway by both Norwegians and the expatriate oil industry community centred on the city. However, it shot into the spotlight in 2008 when it was crowned European Capital of Culture, alongside Liverpool. Stavanger's history comes to life in its 12th-century cathedral, the wonderfully preserved 17th-century Old Town and the bustling Vågen fishing harbour, while the compelling canning and petroleum museums bring to life the more recent past. This rich heritage, combined with a busy schedule of music, art and culinary festivals, warrants Stavanger's culture tag. And, thanks to its lucrative title, petroleum capital of Norway, it has developed into the country's most international city (English is spoken everywhere), filled with boutiques, cafés and world-class restaurants, the latter earning it another title — Norway's culinary capital. Stavanger is also the gateway to a wealth of outdoor activities — kite-surfing on the white sand beaches of the Jaeren coast, cruising on the Lysefjord and hiking up to the famous Pulpit Rock are all within a short drive of the city. As such, Stavanger and its surroundings make a perfect short break destination, being only a two-hour flight from London. Wander round the Old Town with its dazzling white clapboard houses, explore the brightly painted quirky shops and cafés of Øvre Holmegate and taste the excellent seafood at Bølgen & Moi, overlooking the harbour. Take a cruise to the Lysefjord and trek up to the Kjeragbolten, a huge boulder wedged in a crevasse. You can grab a bag of fresh shrimps from a fisherman at Vågen to enjoy as you watch the boats come and go. Or head to Sandnes (11 minutes by train) for brunch at the Charles & De brasserie (the small open sandwiches — snitter — are the stuff of local legend), before strolling along the lively Langgata shopping street. To appreciate the scale of the Lysefjord's 1,000m (3,000ft) granite walls take a kayak trip along the 37km (23 miles) separating Forsand and Lysebotn, the villages at opposite ends of the fjord. Finally head for the island of Sør-Hidle, home to the Flor & Fjære botanical gardens. The remarkably tropical island is a riot of colour in summer and home to a celebrated restaurant. Despite being only 20 minutes from Stavanger by boat, the island feels a world away from the city. regionstavanger.com"
Some home truths for 'on location' TV chiefs,Norway,"Last week I saw a lot of locationism. It's a concept I came up with when conducting RTE television training courses. Locationism is the delusion that going on location will solve most of your story problems. The truth is that you have to take the story with you. That is why locationism is one of the Seven Deadly Sins committed by clueless television chiefs. As I hope to prove. * * * I learned to avoid locationism while making a film on manic depression called Darkness Visible featuring the singer Johnny McEvoy. I needed to recreate his epiphany on the stage of Manchester Free Trade Hall, where he felt he was about to fallbut found the courage to carry on. My budget was big enough to take a crew to Manchester. But the location was not the point of the sequence, which would cost thousands, and with only one camera, the shots would be confined by the proscenium arch and the demands of the caretaking staff. So I said no tothe trip. Instead I bookedStudio One in Montrose, stood McEvoy on asmall stage of boxes,stuck a red bulb overhis head, hired a Steadicam for two hours and let lighting cameraman Godfrey Graham loosewith complete freedomto move 360 degrees.It looked a lot betterthan anything we would have got on location. * * * Going on location without your own story leaves you at the mercy of the first local chancer you meet. Anyone who has found a special holiday spot knows this. On the second visit you will often find the local ""character"" who first charmed you has no character, and now annoys you as much as he annoys his neighbours. The Indian writer Ved Mehta in her hilarious book Karma Cola recounts how German hippies looking for gurus usually found the local Lothario-cum-criminal. Likewise, if you go to Libya without the language or a local guide whose political affiliations are acknowledged, you are like a lost tourist at the mercy of a local taxi driver. * * * Last Tuesday, RTE News chiefs committed a major crime of locationism by flying its foreign editor Margaret Ward to what we were told was Tripoli. But it could have been anywhere.Ward stood with perfectly coiffed hair and a cerisetop with a scooped neckline in front of a peaceful skyline that looked like a still picture. Two nights later, possibly fearing charges of another Charlie Bird in Kuwait, they moved Ward, in brand new press bib and perfectly pressed white trousers, to a cosmetic checkpoint complete with characters from central casting shooting rifles aimlessly in the air. What was the point? Ward was arriving far too late, does not speak the language and is not an expert on the issues involved. Sending this fine RTE reporter to stay in a safe hotel for health and safety reasons was a waste of public money. Far better to buy some good footage from fair-minded British reporters on Al Jazeera, or talk to a Libyan expert/exile in London who is in regular email contact with rebel leaders, andis not distracted by thekind of chancers whoman checkpoints. Better still, RTE News should have kept Margaret Ward in Dublin and let her talk on a link to a frontline reporter like Mary Fitzgerald of the Irish Times, who has spent weeks in Libya and can tell real rebels from the chancers in cosmetic scarves who hang around checkpoints. * * * The BBC is even worse than RTE when it comes to crimes of locationism. Last Thursday, Seven Wonders of the Buddhist World, presented by Bettany Hughes on BBC2, took us to endless exotic locations but never stopped to spell out Buddha's teachings in simple terms. Like this. Buddha taught a bleak but bracing truth. Life is suffering. The root cause of suffering is our ego, which encourages us to grasp at the twin ghosts of hope and fear. This entanglement hides the reality of our true nature. He also taught that bad habits are usually beloved habits. Or as Shakespeare says, it is hard to root out ""one fond offence"".Like locationism. * * * Although locationism is bad, locations can be good.But only if the place is pregnant with the past. Like Beal na Blath. Last Sunday Professor Ed Walsh spoke where Michael Collins was shot. Like all his predecessors he pondered what Collins might have made of contemporary events. But while such speculationsare pointless, there was plenty of other red meat in his speech. The reddest part was his polemic against the high salaries we pay our public sector. Alas, RTE and the print media redacted that part. This was a pity in a week in which we found out that four members of the UCC staff were paid a salary of over €200,000. * * * The Rose of Tralee is also a good use of a location. Technically it could come from the National Convention Centre in Dublin. But then we would receive it with different cultural receptors. Because it comes from Tralee we respect its decent provincial desire to celebrate charm and character. Apart from a few sneery attention seekers, most of us switch off our metropolitan scanners and get behind Daithi O Se's rough banter. Later on, switching over to TV3 to watch Tonight with Sarah Carey I caught a shot of Claire Daly and Phil Hogan. For one magic millisecond I thought I was watching a red-haired Tralee contestant with her large male escort. Deputy Daly made a lot of sense on mortgage relief. To annoy her, let me add she is also a very attractive woman who would win my fantasy festival. It's called the Red Rose of Traleeand is presented byIvan Yates. Yates takes over from Sarah Carey next week.Any man who is politically incorrect enough to call paternity leave ""sitting around watching Sky Sports with a few cans"" is not to be missed. So get a few cans and enjoy yourself. * * * Let me leave you with a word about the alleged oil and gas deposits along our Atlantic seaboard. Alleged because in a letter tothe Irish Times lastweek John Doyle askeda leading question: ""If our oil and gas is being given away, why is the Atlantic seaboard of Ireland not over-run with prospectors drilling holes for oil and gas like there is along the Atlantic coast of Norway?"" Failing an answer, Fintan O'Toole's fretting about whether we should let Norway run oil and gas which we don't have yet seems as fruitless as the old Buddhist parable about the man who stayed awake all night worrying about a snake that turned out to be a piece of old rope. Rinpoche Rabbitte rightly reminded O'Toole that instead of the state spending billions on prospecting -- as Norway does -- it is more sensible to let the Shell snake take the risks and let the Republic collect themoney for old rope."
"Breathtaking polar wonderland you'll never forget; SVALBARD Svalbard is another world of haunting landscapes and warm hospitality. And it's just a few hours from Britain, says Roger Norum",Norway,"Many travellers planning a once–in–a–lifetime journey to the Earth's extremities will choose Antarctica. But why spend tens of thousands of pounds and use several weeks' holiday when you can visit the polar wonderland of the Arctic, just a few hours' flight from the UK? A trip to the Svalbard archipelago is in effect a journey to one of the ends of the Earth. This breathtaking glacial island, 400 miles north of the Norwegian mainland and 800 miles from the North Pole, is where Prince Harry trained for the BBC series Harry's Arctic Heroes. During the depth of winter, the sun stays a full eight degrees below the horizon during the 112–day polar night but the amount of sunlight per day rapidly increases as spring approaches. There are few roads in this land of extremes: one rides snowmobiles, dogsleds, boats and aircraft to get around. But despite the hostile environment, Svalbard is a devastatingly gorgeous place to visit, especially in the colder months when a magical blue haze engulfs a Bergmanesque landscape and the Arctic winter opens itself up to curious visitors. The warming gulf stream helps keep the coastal waters ice–free and navigable, as passengers head out on a range of excursions, including snowmobile journeys to fjord coves and husky–driving across the tundra. As the world's most northerly settled land, Svalbard easily lends itself to geographical superlatives – even the world's most northerly kebab outlet and souvenir shop! Experiences up here are as otherworldly as the environment. Have you ever engaged in a staring contest with a trio of portly reindeer? Or sailed along a completely untouched fjord? How about hiking on a permafrost landscape strewn with antlers and whalebones, where your guide's dog is fetching rocks, not sticks? Or perhaps you like the idea of kicking back on a snowy beach opposite soaring mountains as you dine on campfire–cooked ox stew and fjord–chilled champagne before donning an orange drysuit to float around in icy waters? A trip up here is hardly your average holiday. Of course, no mention of Svalbard and its main island of Spitsbergen in particular can pass without mention of the encounter with a polar bear that led to the tragic death of a young British adventurer a few weeks ago. The fact is that although Svalbard has a healthy population of this endangered species, attacks on humans are extremely rare. It is not permitted to actively seek polar bears in Svalbard and if visitors do see them, it is likely to be at a safe distance on an organised activity with the services of a professional guide. Willem Barents made the first recorded discovery of Svalbard in 1596. The Vikings had been here earlier but found little to pillage and soon left for pastures more fertile. It was the third year in a row that Barents had come in search of the Northeast Passage and when his Dutch crew saw the icy peaks of Svalbard, they believed they had arrived in Greenland. A decade later, an English ship landed to hunt walrus, followed by French and Danish whalers, Russian polar bear and fox trappers and, at the beginning of the 20th century, Norwegian coal miners. Mining burgeoned after the 1900s and pits and collieries are strewn about a number of island settlements. As well as its role as a hotbed for adventure tourism, Svalbard today exists largely for Arctic research purposes. It is, for example, home to the Global Seed Vault, which stores seeds from thousands of crop varieties and their botanical wild relatives from all over the world. The mythology of early exploration continues to be central to life here. The region's place names, for example, read like an encyclopaedia of Arctic discoverers and explorers. There is Taylorfjellet, a mountain named after the editor of the Scottish Geographical Magazine, WA Taylor; Murraypynten, a cape named after the 19th–century Scottish oceanographer Sir John Murray; and Thomas Smithøyane, a group of islands named after 16th–century English merchant and adventurer Thomas Smythe. This sense of adventure regularly infuses journeys with both a hint of nostalgia and a strong sense of being in a place where few others have been. Take a trip up to Svalbard and it will be impossible to leave disappointed. Remember: Norway is not your average country. It's a country where people are extremely respectful of a person's silence and personal space and yet they readily volunteer their time to help others. And in my opinion Norway also happens to be the most beautiful destination on the planet. Nowhere is this more evident than on Svalbard, where the activities available for travellers comprise some of the most unforgettable experiences you will ever find. Yet there's no need to rough it. Despite its remote location, Svalbard – especially in the biggest settlement, Longyearbyen – has good quality hotels and lodgings, restaurants serving top–class Arctic cuisine and a number of bars, some with live music. ADVENTUROUS ACTIVITIES One of the most invigorating experiences you can sign up for during the winter months is a snowmobile safari with Svalbard Snøscooterutleie (www.svalbardbooking.com[http://www.svalbardbooking.com]). As there are few roads outside Longyearbyen, snowmobiles often serve as the sole means of transport in the winter across the island. They also let you visit otherwise inaccessible places: wooded hills, steep mountains and seemingly endless plateaus and glaciers – such as the Longyear glacier, whose peaks offer gorgeous views of the Arctic hinterlands. Outside the capital's protective River Bed Route and its 30mph speed limit, the islands are your oyster. You can speed off across frozen waterways, lakes and fjords to explore remote settlements such as Cape Linné on the western coast, loomed over by a massive radio tower and a dilapidated satellite dish. Established in 1933, the cape's Isfjord Radio Station was the sole telecommunications link between Svalbard and mainland Europe. The settlement has now been re–envisioned as a rustic–chic base for explorations into the Arctic wilderness, with swish rooms furnished with exposed wood, large beds, goatskin blankets and driftwood sculptures, with high–powered binoculars that await you on the window sill (the station looks out on a protected bird area). If your interest extends to the unique history of the Arctic, you could try venturing out to explore some of the abandoned settlements of the archipelago that have played seminal roles in the history of the region. Adventure group Spitsbergen Travel (www.spitsbergentravel.no[http://www.spitsbergentravel.no]) organises visits to some of Svalbard's more remote areas, including a handful of Russian settlements whose few residents eke out a meagre living in coal mining. The quintessential example is Barentsburg, a small community sold by Norway to Russia in 1932, where several hundred residents largely cling to the hope that oil will one day be found here – a dream that may not be entirely foolhardy, given Norway's luck with oil in recent decades. Alternatively, you could head further south to the southern edge of the majestic Isfjorden, where you can visit all–but–left–for–dead Pyramiden, another Russian settlement that is as much a ghost town as you'll come across anywhere. The outpost's snowy fjord once attracted French, Dutch and English whalers in the 16th century, but today all is quiet. If it is anywhere, this is the wild, wild North. There are other ways to experience the wild, too. The moment you arrive at Svalbard Reiseliv's husky lodge (www.svalbard.net[http://www.svalbard.net]), you'll find a team of powder–white Siberian huskies yelping and howling in their pens, with mushers rigging, feeding and prepping the pack for your day–long safari. Once the dogs are ready, you'll spring off through Svalbard's silent taiga. The only sound to break the eerie silence of the North is when tall pine trees send blankets of snow crashing down on to the trails, covering fresh fox tracks. While few non–Norwegians ever make it this far, Svalbard is one of the country's most magical places to explore by husky and sled. Come evening, as the dogs are chomping down outside on bones, you'll sit down to a nourishing meat–and–potatoes dish of sautéed reindeer, thinly sliced in a thick cream sauce. Dining on Rudolph may not be the first thing you'll want to tell your children about, but the semi–wild reindeer has been a fundamental part of life here for centuries: its skin and fur is used for clothing and blankets, its antlers fashioned into handicrafts and housewares. The beasts are free to roam the northern plateaus in large herds, producing a finetextured, flavourful meat that is much leaner than that of farmed animals. While visiting certain parts of Norway, you might hear someone throw out the term koselig, a Scandinavian sensibility translated as ""cosy"", ""comfortable"" or ""friendly''. Koselig is when you're sitting around a fireplace drinking aquavit; a koselig home usually has a fire, candles, yummy smells and good friends. Koselig is certainly what you experience when you're kicking back on Mary–Ann's Polarrigg (www.polarriggen.com[http://www.polarriggen.com]), the most spectacular and authentic place to stay in the archipelago. Known locally as The Rig, this special destination first opened its doors several decades ago as a small wooden barracks built for local miners and workers. With three separate buildings, 41 cosy rooms and a comfy lounge filled with books and curiosities, it has become a unique place to spend a few nights. There are exposed beams and rustic amenities, and a stay here gives one a taste of what Svalbard was like for the miners and trappers who came here a century ago. The only thing that might seem out of place is the restorative Thai spa – though you're unlikely to complain. It is the perfect place to linger over a bottle of wine with friends, meet fellow travellers, or just kick back and reflect on what a memorable place is Svalbard.

Norway route oils the wheels of trade and tourism,Norway,"AIRLINE chiefs hope to strike black gold after launching direct flights between Glasgow and Stavanger in Norway, the world’s third largest oil exporter. Several major energy companies have a base in Stavanger and Eastern Airways has decided to introduce the only direct service which will link the Norwegian city with Central Scotland. Based at Humberside Airport, Britain’s second biggest regional airline already flies to Stavanger from Aberdeen and Newcastle and has provided air services to the North Sea offshore industry for the last 13 years. The maiden flight from Glasgow took off yesterday morning. Eastern Airways will operate flights to and from Norway on a Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Commercial director Kay Ryan said: “This new Glasgow service is great news for offshore workers who live in Central Scotland as it is the most convenient way for them to reach Norway’s oil capital. “Norwegian companies and contractors with connections in Glasgow and the region will also save valuable time using this service while tourists can take advantage of city breaks.” The launch of new flights was also welcomed by Glasgow City Council Leader Gordon Matheson, who also chairs the Glasgow City Marketing Bureau. He said: “The new Stavanger service adds yet another valuable route to our network of flights and is a boost for both business and the short break tourist market. “Even in these tough times Glasgow is constantly improving its air links and we will continue to work hard to build on this latest success.” Single fares on the 50-seater flights start at £99. There are no extra charges for check-in, baggage, choice of seat or onboard drinks and snacks and passengers will use a dedicated fast track security channel to avoid queues."
Getting a New Fleet to Keep Costs Down --- Norwegian Air Shuttle CEO Banks on Boeing 787 Dreamliners to Cut Operating Expenses and Fuel Growth,Norway,"Corrections & Amplifications Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA posted a net loss of 239.5 million kroner in the first half of 2011. A Management article about the company Tuesday incorrectly said the loss was for the second quarter. (WSJE October 19, 2011) (END) Budget airlines may have been the air transport industry's great success story of the past decade but they have yet to make their no-frills, low-cost models work for long-haul travel. While Easyjet's Sir Stelios Haji-Iannou has said in a recent interview that he plans to launch a new long-haul trans-Atlantic air service, and Ryan Air boss Michael O'Leary has been talking about offering cheap flights from Europe to the U.S. for three years, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA is likely to be first off the tarmac as it plans to launch long-haul flights from Scandinavia to New York and Bangkok in late 2012 or early 2013. Low-cost trans-Atlantic services, long seen as airlines' Holy Grail, have proved elusive: failed attempts include Freddie Laker's Skytrain and more recently Canada's Zoom Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. But Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian's 65-year-old chief executive, thinks these earlier attempts failed because they weren't, in fact, low-cost. ""They were low-price flights. But not low-cost,"" he says. ""Anybody can fly low-price, you just cut the price tag."" Low-cost doesn't just mean low prices for the passenger, but minimizing costs to the carrier, says Mr. Kjos. To his rivals he asks: ""But can you operate long-haul flights within a low-cost model?"" adding confidently: ""We can."" In addition to a business model that has made his company Scandinavia's second-biggest airline, in terms of passengers, since its start-up 17 years ago, Mr. Kjos has a secret weapon: the six Boeing 787 Dreamliners the company recently ordered. Mr. Kjos estimates the Dreamliners cost about 30% less to operate than other aircraft. ""So we're starting out with 30% lower costs from the get-go, and intend to fly at half the cost that present trans-Atlantic carriers have. And the Dreamliners are the key. You can't fly low-cost with old airplanes,"" he says. Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. last month was the first company to take delivery of the Dreamliner, with its first commercial flights scheduled to start Nov. 1. The plane is a wide-body design, the first commercial jet made largely of plastic-composite materials instead of aluminum. Design and production glitches, including substantial quality-control problems in its supply chain, delayed the plane's commercial rollout for three years. But Boeing now says the supply chain for the Dreamliner is in ""very good shape."" This is good news for Mr. Kjos, who thinks the next decade will see a boom in low-cost intercontinental travel. ""There will be a lot more travel between continents in 10 years' time. And this will mainly be driven by tourism,"" he says. Looking further ahead, Mr. Kjos believes the flow of tourists will change direction and that a majority of the tourists in the future will be flying from Asia to Europe and not the other way around. ""That is where we'll see growth going forward,"" he says. Mr. Kjos also mentions India, Vietnam and Africa as possible future destinations for Norwegian. Mr. Kjos, who is also the airline's biggest shareholder, has been with the company since it was established from the remains of bankrupt Norwegian airline Busy Bee in 1993. Last year, Norwegian transported 13 million passengers. But it started out as a regional airline in western Norway, operating routes on behalf of Braathens SAFE airline. This contract was canceled in 2001 when Braathens was bought by Scandinavian airline SAS. Norwegian couldn't compete with SAS on the regional routes it had previously operated and the only way to save the jobs of its 130 employees was, Mr. Kjos says, simply to start over from scratch. Re-established as a low-cost carrier in 2002, Norwegian followed bravely in the footsteps of Norway's first low-cost pioneer, Color Air, which had gone bankrupt in 1999 after just one year of operation, with losses totaling 400 million Norwegian kroner ($71 million). ""SAS had a monopoly situation when we started our business in 2002 and Norway had the highest air fares in the world,"" Mr. Kjos says. Norwegian initially competed with SAS on four routes, but didn't fare much better than Color Air. Operating losses ended up at 71.7 million kroner in 2002 and the company had a total of 1.2 million passengers that year. ""The only way we would make it was if we managed to keep our costs very low,"" Mr. Kjos says. He says Norwegian started to expand in order to lower its costs and that the airline also started to fly directly to Europe using provincial airports. ""We didn't fly into Copenhagen or Oslo, but straight from destinations such as Bergen and Trondheim out into Europe,"" he says. ""That way we managed to get volume and cut our costs."" But oil prices kept climbing, more than doubling during the company's first five years as a low-cost carrier. Looking into the future Mr. Kjos says he had to assume oil prices would double yet again, ending up somewhere around $120 a barrel in 2012. ""We had to ask ourselves if we could continue to make money flying the aircraft we had, and the answer was no,"" he says, noting that old aircraft need more maintenance and use more fuel than newer ones. ""The only way to keep the costs down is to have a new fleet."" Buying new planes was the only way for the company to avoid bankruptcy, Mr. Kjos says, and in 2007 Norwegian ordered 42 Boeing aircraft, with a list price of more than 18 billion kroner. The order has since been increased to a total of 78 planes to be delivered up until 2018. Norwegian's fleet of 59 planes -- 42 Boeing 737-800s and 17 Boeing 737-300s -- will be streamlined into a unitary fleet of 737-800s in 2012, with an average age of three years. The company expects to have 73 aircraft by 2015, not counting the six Dreamliners, the first of which are expected to be delivered during the fall and winter of 2012-2013. Aviation has been a central part of Mr. Kjos's life ever since he was a child. His father owned a small airplane, which he used to photograph farms from the air, and he allowed his son to accompany him. ""Flying has been a great interest of mine ever since I was seven or eight years old,"" he says. He later became a jet fighter pilot in the Norwegian Royal Air Force. He was stationed in Bodo in the north of Norway between 1970 and 1975, guarding Norwegian airspace against Soviet intruders. ""It was a very exciting time during the Cold War,"" he says. ""We were on stand-by to intercept [Soviet aircraft] every day."" After leaving the air force, Mr. Kjos went on to get a law degree from Oslo University and it was as a lawyer he first came in contact with Busy Bee and helped create Norwegian Air Shuttle. Today he controls about 27% of the company, which was listed on the Oslo stock exchange in 2003. European airlines have seen their margins shrink as a result of increased competition and high fuel prices. Norwegian posted a net loss of 239.5 million kroner in the second quarter of 2011, but Mr. Kjos still believes the price pressure in the European aviation market is healthy. Norwegian will post its third-quarter figures Thursday. A Factset survey of eight analysts showed expectations that it will post a net profit of around 470 million kroner. ""Competition is a positive thing for consumers. Prices are high enough as it is, it's the costs that need to be addressed,"" he says. ""If someone had told me then what the prices would be like today, I would never have started an airline, I would not have believed them.""

CLIMATE RISK TO POLAR BEAR HABITATS,Norway,"Climate change is set to drive a dramatic reduction in polar bear habitats in coming decades, conservationists warned today as they called for action to help the species. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), recent trends for the extent and thickness of the marine sea ice that polar bears rely on suggests it is set to dramatically shrink over the next 50 to 100 years. The Arctic could see annual sea ice decline by between 10% and 50% by 2100, hitting polar bear populations, the IUCN said. Research from the Norwegian Polar Institute suggests the ice is thinning to such an extent that it could almost completely melt in a summer with favourable conditions and might leave the Arctic ice-free in summer within a decade. The Norwegian Polar Institute's Dag Vongraven, who is chairman of the IUCN's polar bear specialist group, warned: ""Now is the time to act in order to save the waning polar bear population. ""If we fail to make a stand to save this species we risk having the population become severely decimated, and quite certainly they will have disappeared from many areas where they're found today."" Polar bears, whose predicament has become a symbol of climate change, reside largely on sea ice throughout Canada, Greenland, Norway, Russia and Alaska. Some have continuous access to ice and are able to hunt all year, while others in areas where the ice melts completely in the summer then spend several months on land fasting until the sea freezes again. The species is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List for threatened species, with populations thought to be decreasing. Numbers could fall by as much as 30% by 2050. Simon Stuart, chairman of IUCN's species survival commission, said: ""Climate change will be one of the major drivers of species extinctions in the 21st century. ""In order to slow the pace the adverse effects of climate change are having on species around the world, we must work to reduce use of energy from fossil fuels and ensure that our leaders make and adhere to strong commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions now."" Other factors which also affect the species include toxic contaminants, shipping, oil and gas exploration and polar bear watching by tourists. end"
"At the beginning of the Earth: the lonely life at 79 degrees north; Gavin Bell travels from Scotland to the harsh and beguiling frozen world of the Arctic, where it pays to carry a gun",Norway,"The old trapper's hut beneath Singing Mountain bears the scars of an unwelcome visitor. The door is barred with stout wooden poles and the windows are boarded with planks and protruding nails, but great gashes have been clawed in the tarred felt cladding the walls. Nearby there are paw prints in the snow, the unmistakable spoor of polar bear. This is as wild and lonely as life gets pretty much anywhere on the planet. The hut stands at the foot of a near vertical wall of rock in an icy fjord in the high Arctic, a week away by dog sled from the nearest human settlement. Generations of Russian and Norwegian hunters have lived in Hornsund, the most southerly fjord in Spitsbergen, shooting and trapping bear, walrus and Arctic fox until their prey became protected or undesirable. Now the driftwood hut is a relic of a bygone age, in a wilderness of breathtaking beauty. The only practical way of reaching it is by sea, which is how we come ashore on a voyage from Scotland. We are accompanied by guides armed with flash pistols and hunting rifles, scanning the snowfields for polar bears for whom this is a seasonal migration route. Above us towers Horn Peak, its 4,695ft summit lost in clouds and vertiginous cliffs, alive with thousands of fulmars, kittiwakes and guillemots whose incessant din gives the mountain its nickname. A guide removes the door barricades, and inside ice and snow have invaded the first room, but a rear room with bunk beds and an iron stove is surprisingly warm and cosy. On a shelf there are herb and spice jars with Polish names, probably left by members of a Polish research station in the fjord, and a dog–eared copy of Robinson Crusoe, which seems appropriate. ""Many of the hunters were loners,"" our Swedish guide, Olle, says. ""They were a bit anti–social. They didn't fit in."" They would have been kindred spirits of the Greenlandic explorer Knud Rasmussen, who memorably summed up the call of the Arctic wild: ""Give me winter, give me dogs, and you can have the rest."" There is a sense of privilege in being able to wander around this historic outpost of hardy pioneers in comfort and security. Then a prowling visitor arrives. We are back on the ship when an alert officer spots him on a distant shore, a fully grown male bear heading towards the hut. We speed off in zodiac inflatable boats, and watch in silence from barely 50 yards away as the apex predator ambles along with lazy, powerful strides. He scents our presence, lifts his head, and regards us intently with black eyes. If we had been on land, this would have been a good time to check life assurance policies. But our bear has no interest in gawping tourists, and resumes his steady progress. At one point, he crests a rise, spreads his legs and glides down the other side on his stomach, then rolls over with his legs in the air for the fun of it. In a zoo he would be a star attraction; here he is in his element as an emblem of Arctic wildlife. Next we visit a colony of sabretoothed monsters that used to attack ships. At least those were the tales spun by early mariners who first sighted walrus. We find a furry mound of them lolling on a beach on a remote island, but they are more intent on sleeping and scratching themselves with their flippers than making a concerted assault on our zodiacs. This is where Olle demonstrates the Swedish pastime of ""democratic snowball fighting"" with half a dozen volunteers. The idea is you gather in a tight circle, throw snowballs straight up and bend forward. Almost everybody gets hit, but since nobody knows by whom, there is no anger or retaliation. The sabretoothed monsters are unimpressed. Spitsbergen is the largest island in the frozen archipelago of Svalbard, halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole. It is our final destination on a two–week cruise from Aberdeen that has had its ups and downs. Most of them occurred on the first two days, when stormy weather forced the captain to abandon plans to visit Orkney and Shetland, and make a run for the calmer waters of the Norwegian fjords. They were so tranquil and clear that Olle thought he saw a bird drowning in one, when it was actually the reflection of a gull gliding above the surface. Viking earls and their vassals used to batter each other in turf wars in these Nordic glens, now their descendants coexist more peaceably by small acre farming in between shifts on North Sea oil rigs. The dramatic scenery of their homeland lends itself to stirring music, as we find on a bus tour accompanied by recordings of Grieg's Peer Gynt, of a male–voice choir extolling the beauty of a valley, and of a soprano as we pass her grave in a village churchyard. Farther north, the final resting place of an Irish princess who refused to marry a Viking chief is a place of pilgrimage on an island where winds and waves brought her on a boat with no rudder, oars or sails. The tale of St Sunniva, Norway's only female saint, is the stuff of medieval legends. Her body is said to have been found incorrupt in a cave on the island of Selje in AD 996, leading to the foundation of a Benedictine monastery. Ruins of the monastery stand above a reconstructed bell tower, and worn stone steps lead to the saintly cave. A quirk of light causes a strange luminescence in its dark recesses, and as we emerge someone tolls the bell. We stand in silence, and there is an illusion of slipping back in time. Sheep are grazing on a white carpet of Arctic cotton, and it is easy to imagine hooded monks walking among them. The first place in the world – at least in most atlases – lies at the end of a road to nowhere. Beyond it lies only dark mountains and a terrifying maelstrom, but the old fishing village of Å in the Lofoten Islands has a café, two museums and a gift shop. The shoals of Arctic cod that once sustained the little community are long gone, and now the locals fish for tourists with a postcard–pretty hamlet of wooden houses and fishermen's huts huddled around a natural harbour. Our next port of call in the Lofotens was once voted the most scenic place in Norway. Reine still has a few fishing boats, ranged against a backdrop of sawtooth mountains where sea eagles fly. A couple of these magnificent birds swoop above us during a zodiac tour of the fjord, which causes some excitement and the loss of a camera. It is last seen by its rueful owner, who omitted to use a wrist strap, describing a perfect parabola on its way to the depths. This is unfortunate, as next day we encounter half a dozen fin whales blowing and waving their massive tails, with dolphins cavorting among them and playing in our bow wave. We also pass two dead whales, belly up on the surface, prompting an irreverent suggestion that we tow them to Svalbard to use as bear bait. There is no need, as the archipelago is crawling with between 2,500 and 3,000 hungry bears. This means they outnumber humans, and that most of the latter carry big guns when they leave the settlements. The polar explorer Roald Amundsen didn't need a gun on Spitsbergen, because he had an airship. The mast it was tethered to still stands at Ny Ålesund, an old coal mining camp now an international research station, from where he made the first flight over the North Pole in 1926. The other attraction for visitors here is the world's most northerly post office, where passports can be stamped to attest that the intrepid bearers have ventured to 79 degrees north. The main community of Longyearbyen, a curious mix of old mine workings, polar research institutes and adventure tourism outlets, has a modern museum that illustrates the perils and allure of life on the edge of polar pack ice. An image of a polar bear on a sign warns visitors never to leave the settlements unarmed, and recommends a high–powered hunting rifle as an appropriate weapon for self defence. There is also a quote by Odd Ivar Ruud, the last trapper to live in the hut in Hornsund in the Seventies, and whose name is carved on a wooden board above its door. He said: ""I am no god out here. I cannot make the wind blow or the snow fall. Sometimes I cannot even get my sled dogs to obey me. But I am second to a god. I am a human being, alive, due to my efforts."" Noble Caledonia has a 15–day cruise from Scotland to Spitsbergen from May 26 to June 10, 2012 from £3,695 (020 7752 0000; www.noble–caledonia.co.uk[http://www.noble–caledonia.co.uk]). Dog sleds and snipers in the North Pole Just another crazy day in Longyearbyen. A young woman with piercing blue eyes and a hunting rifle takes us to meet her friend Amoq, a veteran of North Pole expeditions. He is a Greenlandic sled dog and, together with a team of local huskies, we career over a mountain glacier above giant satellite dishes probing the aurora borealis. The summit is shrouded in freezing mist, and my wife is concerned we might have a close encounter of the scary kind with a polar bear. However, we have nothing to worry about, because our guide Eva used to be a sniper with the Latvian Special Forces. Luckily for itinerant bears we don't meet any in a couple of loops around the lower slopes of the mountain, and have time to admire panoramic views of the icy wilderness around us. The highlight comes at the end, a helter–skelter descent with Eva on the brake, my wife on the sled shrieking with excitement, and me hanging off the edge of it to keep it stable in the manner of a racing dinghy sailor. I doubt if I will ever join one of Amoq's jaunts to the North Pole, but it was fun to get a taste of it and wander off to a café for a cappuccino.

"Seeing, and smelling, oil sands is believing; One tour a week",Norway,"CONKLIN, ALTA. - It's before dawn in the oil sands and another planeload of oil sands tourists has landed. They're bussed to a plant in the boreal bush, suited up in big coveralls, walked through tidy processing facilities and wellheads, and then fed hearty Alberta beef at the staff lodge. The climax? Seeing and smelling oil sands bitumen - the sum of environmentalists' fears - in a paper coffee cup. The host is Statoil ASA, the Norwegian state-controlled oil and gas giant. Facing a huge backlash at home over its interest in the deposits - known as oljesand in Norwegian - the company has taken a practical approach to addressing critics. It has opened the door to its in-situ operation to as much of Norway as it can handle - environmentalists, politicians, bureaucrats, media, analysts, company employees. This year alone, Stavangerbased Statoil has hosted 50 tours, many of which have been led by the president of its Canadian operations, Lars Christian Bacher. At a rate of about one a week, the strategy is taking up so much staff and management time, it's a big part of its Canadian business. Yet with decades of practice defending its oil and gas activities in Norway's continental shelf to the country's environmental community, Statoil believes taking people to the source pays off. ""When people see what this is, the majority leave with a view that is 180 degrees different from the picture they had in their minds, just by reading the papers and seeing on television,"" Mr. Bacher said. The reaction of Statoil's visitors is typical of those who see so-called steam-assisted gravity drainage operations - as opposed to open-pit mines - many of them located around the community of Conklin, south of Fort McMurray. They come expecting unfettered environmental damage. What they see are neatly organized smallish plants, tank farms, pipelines, dirt roads and work camps, often hidden behind large stretches of forest. Ola Borten Moe, Norway's Energy Minister and member of a large delegation from the Norwegian government who joined a Statoil tour last week, was favourably impressed. ""It's very important to see for yourself what this is about and to see what this is not about,"" said the 35-year-old minister, once a critic of the oil sands. ""I have a good impression of what is happening here. It gives us a very different impression from the one that is presented from the international NGOs in Norway. Overall, it seems to me that Canada is managing its resources in a sustainable way."" The minister's vote of confidence comes as Canada lobbies against plans by the European Union, influenced by environmental organizations, to rank individual fuel sources so that the oil sands would be put at a disadvantage. As a major oil sands developer, Norway plans to help inform the EU's policy architects about the increasing role of unconventional oil and gas sources such as the oil sands and shale gas in energy markets in the future. ""I think that the directive has a way to go yet,"" Mr. Borten Moe said. ""If you put those kinds of systems in place, you have to make sure that the targets are objective and that the system is transparent and fair."" Statoil's own oil sands operation shows the directive is missing the mark. While its oil would be penalized under the new rules, it's no more greenhouse-gas intensive than conventional oil imported in Europe because of its efficient use of steam, Mr. Bacher said. Statoil's ramp-up in the sector has been quick and successful, in contrast to other in-situ operations such as Nexen Inc.'s Long Lake project that struggled with reservoir problems and water handling. Statoil's Leismer project is producing about 18,000 barrels a day (bpd). A second project, Corner, is in the planning stage and aims to produce 40,000 bpd. The company sold 40% of its oil sands operation to PTT Exploration and Production of Thailand in January. Yet Statoil has been dealing with criticism within Norway and from international organizations such as Greenpeace since entering the oil sands business in 2007 with the acquisition of North American Oil Sands Corp. The controversy has been a headache for the government, which owns 67% of Statoil and is dependent on oil and gas revenue to fund government programs. Statoil is a big contributor through tax and dividends to the Scandinavian country's immense sovereign wealth fund, which stands at US$600-billion. Norway has a population of five million people. Mr. Borten Moe said the oil-sands backlash is no different than the tensions over energy development that Norway has been dealing with for decades as a result of the discovery of large offshore deposits four decades ago. Like in Canada, oil and gas development has resulted in higher awareness of the environmental impacts of oil and gas. ""We debate where we are going to have oil and gas and where we are not going to have oil and gas,"" Mr. Borten Moe said. ""We debate the speed that we are developing the resources and we debate the way we spend the revenues."" As a result of those pressures, Statoil has committed to a technology plan to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 40% by 2025. Part of that reduction could come from integrating carbon capture and storage to its oil sands operation. The effort would please environmentalists worried about global warming, but not the communities around the oil sands operation because the technology would require additional water use. It's one of the many tradeoffs about the oil sands, Mr. Bacher said, and coming clean about them has worked well for Statoil. ccattaneo@nationalpost.com"
Norway: an Eden with wifi,Norway,"In Norway last week, I had breakfast with a woman with pink hair, a large ring through her nostrils, and tattoos all over her imposing forearms. She used to be a road manager for Norwegian bands touring Europe's underground scene. I asked her how that was financed. Oh, she said, the Norwegian government helped. The most broadly prosperous society in global history has money for everything. Visiting Norway during the global crisis felt like prosperity tourism, or ""wealth porn"". The world now wishes it were Norway. Yet Norwegians weren't always super rich. Going around, you ask yourself: ""How does a country cope with suddenly acquiring vast wealth?"" Norway spent centuries attached first to Denmark, then to Sweden. It was the rural hinterland, populated largely by farmers, fishermen and Lutheran pastors who weren't rich. I began my trip in the seaside village of Skudenes. I was there for an international literary festival, yet Skudenes had once been a place that the locals fled for the US after the herring ran out. More people left after 1945, when America was the future. Into the 1970s Norway remained a place where fashions arrived just a little later and people watched Swedish TV to keep up with the world. But by then the country had already struck oil. By the 1990s, the wealth was flowing to pretty much everyone. In Norway, the oil actually belongs to the people. The state-controlled oil company - called, with magnificent simplicity, Statoil - pays a marginal tax rate of 78 per cent. Add that on to a decent pre-existing economy, and the 4.9 million Norwegians can do it all: buy third homes and subsidise punk bands and save almost everything in the sovereign oil fund. Oh, and last month they found a huge new offshore oilfield. You imagine destitute Norwegian-Americans across the Midwest now scouring the attic for ancient birth certificates, dreaming of procuring Norwegian passports. Along with oil, Norway built its economy on another natural resource: its women. About three-quarters of Norwegian women now have jobs. They seem to pass from statuesque youthful splendour through a middle age spent on corporate boards before descending into rude geriatric health. The old ladies dashing about volunteer centres looked like retired winter Olympics champions, which statistically speaking many of them must be. Norway tops the all-time medals table for the winter Olympics, just as it seems to top most global rankings, except the rankings where it's more appropriate to be bottom. The upshot is an Eden with WiFi. I cannot describe Skudenes better than the tourist brochure does: ""It is quite charming to saunter amidst white picket fences, gnarled trees and winding narrow roads [etcetera]."" Outside town I goggled at the enormous houses, only to be told that many residents were adding extensions, and often had a summer house, winter cabin and boat besides. The Thai serving fast food out of a kiosk in the cold must feel his kids will owe him unto eternity for having transplanted himself here. ""It's not real!"" a fellow British visitor fumed. Admittedly ""Norway's Second-Best Preserved Small City"" was a bit boring, but that critique misses the point. Paradise is meant to be boring. The rest of us live in interesting times, while Norwegians toss us the occasional Nobel prize by way of encouragement. I asked one local how the world looked from Skudenes. ""Chaotic,"" she replied. From Norway, even Sweden now looks gritty and hardscrabble, like something out of a Stieg Larsson novel. Swedes used to tell Norwegian jokes. Now young Swedes live several to an apartment in Oslo, cooking at home so as to avoid paying £9 for a sandwich, doing lowly jobs in which they take orders in Norwegian while speaking Swedish back. Recently, Icelanders have arrived fleeing their own poverty. However, the submission of the former colonial overlords must particularly tickle Norwegians. Here's a conversation I was privy to in Bergen: ""We could buy Sweden."" ""Buy it and close it down."" ""Or use it for holiday homes."" Of course there was one snake in Eden. No Norwegian I met spontaneously mentioned Anders Breivik's massacre of 77 people this summer. When I asked about it, people called it ""the 22nd of July thing"" or ""what that guy did"". Nothing could have prepared Norwegians for this. The massacre is often described as Norway's ""loss of innocence"", but the towns I saw still looked pretty innocent. In Skudenes young children stood chatting in the street after dark. In the small towns and villages that dot this long country, the great whoosh of wealth has apparently changed relatively little. Some people have installed electricity in their winter cabins. Others regard that as cheating. Yet Norwegians cannot help but be affected by wealth. Many foreign workers here note the extraordinarily relaxed working day, often just a buildup to an evening's skiing. ""We've become spoiled,"" one Norwegian told me. ""Lazy,"" said another. ""Petroholics,"" diagnosed a third. Still, there are worse places in the world. simon.kuper@ft.com"
Plan B Deeside resort gets go-ahead,Norway,"AMBITIOUS plans for a GBP100 million golf, housing and leisure development on Royal Deeside have been approved after the developer reduced the scale of the scheme to protect the habitat of an endangered species. Nine months ago, Aberdeenshire Council threw out plans for the complex, which include a luxury five-star hotel, centred on the existing championship course at Inchmarlo Golf Club on the outskirts of Banchory. The development had been backed by both Scottish Enterprise and VisitScotland as a key development designed to boost tourism in the area. But the scheme was rejected for being ""significantly contrary"" to the local development plan and concerns that it could lead to the loss of Scots pine and Norway spruce, a vital habitat for red squirrels. Yesterday the council approved plans for a revised scheme by 30 votes to 23 after Stan Troup, the chairman of development company Frank Burnett, had launched a fierce attack in the council chamber on the scheme's opponents. Mr Troup accused opponents of mounting a campaign of ""corporate character assassination"" aimed at ""demeaning and undermining"" the application. He added: ""All of this is a co- ordinated attempt to strangle at birth an inspirational development. This development can and will be delivered."" He said the development would help diversify the local economy away from its dependence on the oil and gas industry by boosting tourism. Mr Troup revealed that detailed negotiations were already taking place with a ""global operator"" about operating the hotel planned for the site. Earlier Robert Gray, the council's head of planning, said the number of houses planned had been reduced from 125 to 80, and he was satisfied that the application could be treated as an ""exceptional case"" in terms of the development's tourism and job-creation potential. David Irvine, speaking on behalf of number of objectors, claimed that the development still represented a significant departure from the council's presumption against housing in the policies for the country- side. He warned that approval would ""drive a coach and horses"" through planning policy and ""set a dangerous precedent which will haunt you in the years ahead"". Banchory and Mid-Deeside councillor Jill Webster moved that the application be approved, subject to a series of planning conditions. ""The location is perfect,"" she said. ""It is on the approach to Royal Deeside, identified by Scottish Enterprise as one of the six key tourism locations with the greatest potential for having the greatest impact on the Scottish economy."""
Santa Claus may see you when y,Norway,"Policy analyst Heather A. Conley says the battle over Santa's back yard is heating up as the U.S., Russia and others vie for control of the melting ice caps Santa Claus may see you when you're sleeping, but NORAD makes sure it sees Santa pretty much round-the-clock. The North American Aerospace Defense Command not only follows Saint Nick's sleigh ride with its famous NORAD Tracks Santa site, but it is also involved in a struggle over resources, border control and broader military presence right in Santa's vast and magnificent home: the Arctic. In April, President Obama signed a new command plan that gives NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command greater responsibility in protecting the North Pole and U.S. Arctic territory. The Arctic region - covering more than 30 million square kilometers and stretching around the territorial borders of Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United States by way of the Alaskan coastline - is transforming before our eyes. And not just because the ice is melting. It's increasingly the site of military posturing, and the United States isn't keeping up with the rest of the world. In 2009, Norway moved its operational command to its northern territories above the Arctic Circle. Russia has plans to establish a brigade that is specially equipped and prepared for military warfare in Arctic conditions. Denmark has made it a strategic priority to form an Arctic Command. Canada is set to revitalize its Arctic fleet, including spending $33 billion to build 28 vessels over the next 30 years. Even China has entered the Arctic race; it constructed the world's largest non-nuclear icebreaker to conduct scientific research in the Arctic. September marked the lowest recorded levels of sea ice in the Northern Polar Region. The polar ice cap today is 40 percent smaller than it was in 1979, and in the summer of 2007 alone, 1 million more square miles of ice beyond the average melted, uncovering an area of open water six times the size of California. As quickly as the polar ice cap recedes, commercial opportunities in the resource-rich Arctic advance. The Arctic is governed by the U.N. convention on the Law of the Sea. That framework allows a coastal state to have exclusive economic control 200 miles off its coast - and possibly to extend authority 600 miles beyond, depending on certain scientific claims. In the 21st-century Arctic, large corporations and countries are racing to reach and capture the abundance of offshore oil and gas as well as iron ore, nickel, cooper, palladium and rare-earth minerals. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the Arctic contains 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil resources and 30 percent of its gas resources. And as the ice melts, cargo transport could increase from the 111,000 tons in 2010 to more than 1 million tons in 2012, according to some Russian estimates. It's not just a natural-resources race. Cruise ships take eco-tourists to see the North Pole, stunning Arctic coastline vistas and endangered species such as beluga whales and polar bears - for $24,000 to $35,000 a head. In addition, international scientists search for climate-change clues in Arctic permafrost conditions, ice dynamics and glaciers. Fishing trawlers hunt for lucrative fish stocks. The Arctic has always been a grounds for competition, both over and under the ice. In the early 20th century, it was a race of great explorers and visionaries. The Canadian American Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, known as the ""prophet of the North,"" had the foresight to understand the Arctic's strategic importance and economic potential despite a disastrous expedition. During World War II, the United States rushed to develop supply routes by air and by sea. The country needed to reach the Soviet front and fight off any possible Japanese invasion of Alaska. The Cold War Arctic meant racing to defend against and deter Soviet ballistic nuclear submarines, stealthily patrolling under the Arctic ice, and Soviet strategic bombers flying over it. U.S. security interests in the Arctic today are a dim reflection of that bipolar Cold War era. Yet much of the security infrastructure remaining in Alaska, rusted and largely abandoned, was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. In the Arctic, the United States has had trouble updating its strategy. The most definitive declaration of U.S. policy toward the Arctic is a presidential directive, signed by President George W. Bush in January 2009. Following an extensive interagency effort, the directive outlines some of the most pressing U.S. security interests in the region: missile defense and early-warning systems; strategic deterrence and maritime security operations; maintaining freedom of navigation; and preventing terrorist attacks. It also addresses governance of the internationally controlled region, scientific cooperation, environmental issues and economic developments. But the U.S. strategies and policy statements about the Arctic are poor substitutes for action in the Arctic. And that's where the United States falls flat. The Coast Guard has no operating bases or stations above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. That means that any search-and-rescue or maritime deployment in the U.S. Arctic Sea is delayed by at least eight hours by air and days by sea. Today, the United States has only one medium-duty operational icebreaker in commission, the Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The Coast Guard's entire inventory of such vessels includes two heavy icebreakers, Polar Sea and Polar Star, both of which are not operational. The future of this fleet is in Congress's hands, where the House and Senate are wrangling over funding decisions. The security cost of the limited capability of the United States in the Arctic became clear this month. Officials in Nome, Alaska, needed a Russian tanker to deliver an emergency shipment of fuel when the city was blocked by sea ice, shifted by a strong winter storm. To escort the tanker, the Coast Guard ship Healy had to be diverted from a scientific mission. It is scheduled to break an ice channel for the tanker once the Russian vessel is cleared to enter the Alaskan port and will facilitate the tanker's return to open water. This past summer, Sweden decided to recall its icebreaker, which was leased to the U.S. government, leaving the United States unable to reach and resupply its scientific station in the other polar region, the Antarctic. Alaskan Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell (R) recently told Congress that ""without action, America is putting its national security on the line, and we are going to miss the opportunities of the Arctic while watching other nations advance."" Treadwell isn't just being alarmist. Five years ago, Russia fired cruise missiles over the Arctic in a summer military exercise, resumed surface naval patrols in Arctic waters in 2008, reinforced its strategic nuclear forces in the North, and is currently building eight ballistic missile submarines planned to be completed by 2015. Last year, two Russian strategic bombers carried out a routine patrol mission over the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and were shadowed by a large number of NATO jet fighters, the first time in recent memory that such a large NATO response occurred. The 21st-century Arctic will require strong coordination among the Arctic coastal states, other nations in close proximity to the Arctic such as Sweden, Iceland and Finland, and Arctic indigenous populations. That is why those countries created the Arctic Council in 1996 to support international cooperation on environmental protection and sustainable development. However, the council's mandate forbids it to discuss military or security matters. Although four out of the five coastal states are members of NATO, that is the last organization that Russia would like to see enhance its presence in the Arctic. Yet the longer there is an ad-hoc approach to Arctic security, the greater the risk of misunderstandings, miscommunications and accidents in this dark, ice-covered and hostile region. An Inuit proverb suggests that ""only when the ice breaks will you truly know who is your friend and who is your enemy."" The United States will find out who its allies and rivals will be in the Arctic sooner rather than later. Fifty years ago, securing and controlling the Arctic was a national imperative. In the 21st-century Arctic, the challenges are just as relevant and real, although quite different from preventing a Japanese invasion or stopping a Soviet missile. And the United States needs to act before the opportunity, like the ice, melts away. Heather A. Conley is the director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former deputy assistant secretary of state. She is the author of ""A New Security Architecture for the Arctic: An American Perspective,"" forthcoming from CSIS. "
A Mini-Eden for Endangered Orangutans; Green,Norway,"People are hunting orangutans for food or to protect their crops from orangutans that have already been pushed from the forest. In November, the Indonesian police arrested palm oil plantation workers in East Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo who reported that their supervisor had paid a bounty of $110 for each orangutan they killed. Last month two Indonesian plantation companies - PT Smart, a major palm oil producer, and PT Lontar Papyrus, a wood-pulp supplier - pledged to train workers not to kill or injure orangutans. All life is precious, but the demise of the orangutan hits especially close to home. One of our closest relatives - human and orangutan genomes are 97 percent identical, a study published last year in Nature found - their population has dwindled to somewhere around 50,000. Their range, once spanning much of Southeast Asia, has shrunk to mainly just a couple of islands in Indonesia: Borneo, home to Pongo pygmaeus, and Sumatra, where its critically endangered counterpart, Pongo abelii, hangs on with a population of only around 7,000. All great apes are threatened, but the orangutan - in the Malay language, the word means ""person of the forest"" - is going extinct. The main issue that orangutans face is the loss of their tropical rain forest habitat. In Indonesia, much of it has been erased by palm oil plantations. Illegal logging and gold and zircon mining are other threats. According to a study led by a researcher at South Dakota State University, Borneo and Sumatra lost 9.2 percent of their forest cover from 2000 to 2008. Last summer Indonesia approved a two-year moratorium on granting new licenses for clearing peatlands and primary forests, the result of a $1 billion climate deal with Norway, but critics say the ban is riddled with exemptions and breaches. As their forest shrinks, orangutans are coming into closer contact with humans - a potentially perilous encounter. The Nature Conservancy and 19 other private organizations recently found the rate at which orangutans in Indonesian Borneo are being killed to be higher than previously thought. From 1,970 to 3,100 are killed annually, on average, enough to drive the species toward extinction in 10 to 15 years, their survey found. Orangutan populations do not recover quickly: the average interval between births is about eight years. But it is clear that enforcement remains lax, and the survey's authors concluded that the only effective solution was likely to be cultural and social persuasion. If the orangutans have an Eden, it is Tanjung Puting National Park, 1,174 square miles of peat and freshwater swamp forest on the southern coast of central Kalimantan. Last month I traveled there and visited Camp Leakey, founded inside the park in 1971 by Birute Mary Galdikas, a student of the paleo-anthropologist Louis Leakey and the world's foremost authority on the orangutan, and shot this photo essay for The New York Times. (An expanded version is here.) The camp, a research and conservation center, was used throughout the 1980s to rehabilitate and then release orangutans that had been held captive. (Today orphaned orangutans are brought to a care center outside the park founded by Dr. Galdikas's organization, Orangutan Foundation International, before being returned to the wild elsewhere.) Camp Leakey draws about 2,000 international tourists a year. At a viewable feeding platform, the camp staff leaves bananas for the ex-captive orangutans and their offspring. The handouts provide these semi-wild orangutans with a supplemental diet and minimize competition with the wild orangutan population in the park. Longtime resident orangutans of the Camp Leakey area have become all too familiar with people - many have been given names by the staff - and pass through not just for the bananas but a bit of human company. * After 8 Decades, Tiny Toad Resurfaces in Asia * On Our Radar: A Satellite Tour of a Threatened Rain Forest * Malaysian Forest Ebbing at Rapid Rate, Report Says * 1,000 Words * The Race to Document Biodiversity"
WHAT IF SCOTLAND DID GO IT ALONE?,Norway,"By ANDREW ROBERTS The SNP victory in the independence referendum of Tuesday, June 24, 2014 was impressive by any standards. Despite being held on the 700th anniversary of the battle of Bannockburn ó where Scotland's Robert the Bruce defeated the English forces under Edward II ó few independent commentators thought that as many as 60.4 per cent of Scots would vote Yes to the question 'Do you think Scotland should become independent and leave the United Kingdom?' Only 38.4 per cent voted No. The personal success this represented for Alex Salmond was acknowledged by British premier David Cameron with characteristic generosity: 'Mr Salmond has won a famous victory, and now we in the UK thank the Scottish people for our three centuries of union with them. We wish Scotland well, and hope it has a bright future.' Sadly, it was not to be. The first problem the new Prime Minister of Scotland faced ó 'First Minister' was dropped for being a 'condescending English phrase' ó was the downgrading of the new Scottish currency, the groat, by the international markets. Unlike the Union flag, which was quickly replaced by the blue and white of the saltire, Salmond had originally hoped to keep the pound sterling. But the British Chancellor George Osborne explained that all decisions concerning money supply would be taken solely with consideration for UK, not Scottish, interests. Salmond's hopes that the groat might enjoy parity with sterling, even perhaps 'track it' as sterling once did the deutschmark, were destroyed by speculators' concerted attacks on it on the international stock exchanges. The United Kingdom ó which kept its name as it still united England, Wales and Ulster ó had the Bank of England to step in and support the pound, buying enough sterling to deter such bullying tactics by the markets. But all the Salmond government could do was to raise interest rates, with its own disastrous effect on the rest of the economy. Small wonder, then, that after Scotland lost its AAA credit rating from the agency Standard & Poor's, it quickly looked to Brussels to help it out. Yet it was to be bitterly disappointed. Under normal circumstances the European Union would have been delighted to have a new member state such as Scotland, especially a refugee state from the UK, but the economic circumstances of the summer of 2014 were not normal. With Greece having left the eurozone, and Portugal and Italy still seen as economic basket cases, neither Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany nor President Francois Hollande of France (the Socialist elected to replace Nicolas Sarkozy two years earlier) wanted to take on another small country. Especially as the exact breakdown of national debt between Scotland and the rest of the UK had still not been finally ratified by either parliament. Proportionately by population, Scotland was set to inherit £110 billion of Britain's £1.4 trillion national debt, which would cost it £3.2 billion a year to service at 4 per cent interest. But the World Bank and the IMF ó asked to broker a deal on debt between London and Edinburgh ó were profoundly split on whether population or economic performance should be the criterion. The uncertainty meant EU membership for Scotland looked just too risky a proposition, so the Scots were put behind the Croats in the queue to join. Before independence it was argued by SNP constitutional lawyers that Scotland would somehow automatically 'inherit' its place in the EU because they'd been a member when part of the United Kingdom. But that was not accepted by the powers in Brussels, and the six Scottish MEPs were expelled from the Strasbourg parliament on the same day 72 Scottish MPs said farewell to Westminster. As it turned out, Scotland's representation in other counsels of the world also suffered. She was not admitted into Nato, as her aggressive de-nuclearisation programme and inability to meet the necessary spending requirements on defence disqualified her. At the same time the UK began to recruit Englishmen, Welshmen and Ulstermen to fill gaps in the armed forces previously occupied by Scots. Scotland was welcomed into the Commonwealth, of course, but found no place at the G7, G8 or G20, as she had while part of the United Kingdom. Her seat in the United Nations was also delayed for a long time by the Russians, who objected to their having a place when the Kurds, Palestinians, Tibetans and other ethnic groups did not. When Alex Salmond pointed out that unlike them the Scots had a state of their own, President Putin merely shrugged and was overheard to make a racially offensive remark about haggis. The inability to attain early EU membership meant passport controls were erected along the border between Scotland and England, as well as at the former domestic arrivals areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. A million Scots living and working in the UK and 400,000 Anglo-Scots living in England, as well as the half of the Scottish population with relatives in England, found it highly inconvenient. It also meant taxes levied on 'non-doms' ó rich foreigners working in the UK ó included any Scot who earned enough. And when it was realised there were now customs, immigration and money-changing issues attendant on visiting Scotland, the popularity of the independence movement really waned. Especially when it led to millions of tourists opting for drier climes, which badly hit the tourist trade, Scotland's second biggest foreign currency earner. In retrospect, the moment in June 2015 when the Orkney and Shetland Islands declared their own independence from Scotland, and their intention to become part of Norway, taking with them 23 per cent of Scotland's North Sea Oil revenues, was the turning point. The Edinburgh parliament, having done the same thing to Westminster the previous year, could not stop the referendum taking place, in which the Hebrideans voted by 71 per cent to leave Scotland the following March. As an autonomous region of Norway, the Hebrides soon turned out to be among the richest people per capita in the Northern Hemisphere. Further talk about the Highlands splitting off from the Lowlands placed the Scottish Royal Family ó the Queen had agreed to remain monarch of Scotland ó in a difficult political dilemma. Her Majesty the Queen did well to ignore it all by continuing her trips to Balmoral unaltered. 'We had to put up with this kind of thing a lot with Quebec [and its attempts to secede from Canada] in the 1970s,' she remarked to Alex Salmond at the Braemar Games, to his obvious irritation. Though foolhardy in the long-run, it was brave of Salmond to deliver on his pre-independence promises to increase spending on pensions and higher education, despite it plunging his new country further into the red. With a population of 5.2 million and an economy worth just over £120 billion in 2016, Scotland faced a nerve-racking moment when the price of oil dropped to $45 a barrel as a result of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's death, Libyan oil production coming on-stream and Saudi Arabia increasing production after the fall of President Assad in Syria. Always something of a single-product economy, the Scottish balance of payments was knocked wildly off course by these events, which the Scots could have taken in their stride if they were still part of a larger economic entity, as they had been for 300 years previously. It was lucky for Scotland that Gordon Brown's Labour government had sunk more than £70 billion into Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS in October 2008, something an independent Scotland could never have afforded. Taken together, the assets of those banks amounted to more than 13 times Scotland's annual economic output by 2012. But when in 2014 George Osborne insisted on Scotland picking up its fair share of the £1.25 trillion of total liabilities taken on by the UK in rescuing the banking sector, Scotland's balance sheet looked as rocky as the Highland mountains. Soon, the country found it needed more than rapidly-dwindling North Sea Oil to keep it afloat. Scottish oil production had peaked more than a decade and a half before, and significant further declines in production were forecast by most analysts. The bleak picture moved Alex Salmond to take the greatest risk of his career in the autumn of 2016. He offered to sell 20 years of future oil production to the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, in return for it paying off Scotland's entire national debt and being given a £82 billion sovereign wealth fund ó and two more pandas for Edinburgh Zoo. Yet for the Chinese deal to go through, Salmond needed the support of the Holyrood parliament in Edinburgh, but Scottish National Party members, as well as Labour and Lib-Dems MPs, opposed having the saltire flag dragged down from the oilrigs so soon after it had been raised over them, to be replaced by Beijing's red flag. The cry: 'Better the Commies than the Sassenachs' was heard from some Clydesdale members, but Scottish patriotism prevailed. When it was pointed out Scotland had no navy to enforce the agreement and Nato would not help, let alone the UK, Salmond argued he would appeal to the Council of Europe if Beijing misbehaved in the North Sea at the end of the deal. Salmond's defeat in the 2018 elections, and his replacement as Prime Minister of Scotland by Labour's Wendy Alexander, the former MSP for Paisley North, was perhaps inevitable. After only four years of independence, in June 2018, Wendy Alexander made a momentous visit to Downing Street, where she was greeted by the new British Prime Minister George Osborne. 'You'll know why I've come, George,' said Mrs Alexander once inside. 'I'm afraid I can't begin to imagine,' joked No 10's new occupant. 'Do enlighten me.' 'It seems our forefathers knew more than we guessed when they united our countries for 300 years,' replied Wendy Alexander somewhat grandiloquently. 'Scotland would formally like to request re-admittance into the United Kingdom. Let us restore the blue to the Union Jack; let Scottish passports be consigned to the dustbin of history.' Osborne looked at Mrs Alexander for a moment, considering hard the effects of another 5.2 million people on the books of the NHS and the huge increase in Britain's welfare and benefits bill ó let alone having an extra 41 Labour MPs sitting opposite him in the Commons. He answered: 'I would love to help you rejoin the Union, Mrs Alexander, but the British people ó without Scotland ó would have to vote for it in a referendum. At present they seem happy with the status quoÖ' Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond says Westminster should not interfere in any referendum on independence. But has he really considered what could happen if he breaks up the Union? Historian ANDREW ROBERTS imagines the consequences. © Daily Mail"
Interfax Ukraine Business Daily,Norway,"Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Verkhovna Rada Deputy Head Mykola Tomenko has said he believes that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych should replace the current government and that in relations with Russia, he should learn how to protect the economic interests of the Ukrainian state. He said that the story of ""gas confrontation,"" which has turned into ""a cheese confrontation,"" means in a political sense that ""the Ukrainian government has failed to offer a format of relations with Russia so that our state could be regarded as an independent state with its own interests, and the current Ukrainian government as one that could protect our interests."" ""It's paradoxical and to a large extent tragic for Ukraine that a high-ranking Russian official [Gennady] Onishchenko can mock the Ukrainian government, while his colleague - Ukrainian official [Oleksandr] Anischenko is afraid of defending Ukraine's actions,"" Tomenko was quoted as saying by his press office on Monday. He said that this was a good example, as ""Viktor Yanukovych's team persuaded everybody two years ago during the presidential election campaign and, apparently, it sincerely believed that it is possible to guarantee brotherly love with Russia, but as it turned out, 'Russian love' is based on the principles of the strict protection of national interests, domestic economy, and domestic producers."" In the current situation, according to Tomenko, ""today the president should at least replace the government and officials who cannot defend the Ukrainian economy, and strategically, he should change [his] policy in relations with Russia, in which it's unnecessary to report on the opening of another Russian-speaking school or kindergarten and the publication of a correct textbook in terms of Russian history textbook, but to act from the position of law and the protection of national interests."" Tomenko was elected to the Verkhovna Rada on the election list of the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko. Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has said he doesn't rule out that the national budget for 2012 maybe reviewed in the second quarter this year. ""We've agreed we'll review the existing budget most likely after the first quarter,"" he said on Friday at a meeting with candidates running for the posts of district administration heads. According to the president, he has several issues in the budget he cannot agree to. However, he said, the budget has to be fulfilled. ""You have to see that budget as the one that has to be fulfilled. And all the issues that crop up will be resolved through that budget,"" he added. The president said in particular that representatives of both the central and local authorities should do their best to develop social infrastructure in the regions in 2012. You should complete socially [important] facilities – hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and repair some housing and utilities facilities,"" he said. Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Ukraine's gross public (direct) and guaranteed debt in 2011 shrank from 39.6% to 36.2% of GDP, the Ukrainian Finance Ministry has reported. ""In 2012, the figure is to be kept at the level of 2011,"" the ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site on Monday. The ministry said that direct public debt last year fell from 29.9% of GDP to 27.4% of GDP, including direct foreign debt - from 16.8% of GDP to 15% of GDP, and domestic debt – from 13.1% of GDP to 12.4% of GDP. Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Revenues to Ukraine's national budget from privatization and state-owned property management in 2011-2014 will come to UAH 50-70 billion, the government has forecast. The government expects the said results from the implementation of the privatization program for 2011-2014, which was approved by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, on January 13. According to the document, when the program is realized, the share of the state sector in the economy will fall to 25-30% of GDP (in 2010 the share was assessed at 37% by the State Property Fund of Ukraine). The government said that privatization has been going on for 20 years in the country, so the program aims to finish it. The sale of all small and medium facilities is scheduled for the second stage of the program, set for the second half of 2012 and 2013. The first stage is fixed for the first half of 2012 and is designed for the preparation of the required legislative and organizational base to switch over to privatization on the principles stipulated in the program. It is proposed to accelerate privatization thanks to the facilitation of procedures for preparing the facilities for sale and the ways of selling them. It is planned to lift restrictions on prices, divide them into smaller stakes, sell on the exchanges and put up for sale without announcing their price, in order to sell unattractive stakes. During the privatization of over 50% of the shares in strategic companies (group D), requirements for buyers and the conditions of the post-privatization use of the facilities will be forwarded. The state will retain controlling stakes in group D companies, with the sale of the rest of shares in small stakes on exchanges, at the same time, the size of a controlling stake has been raised from 50% plus one share to 60% plus one share. ""During the third stage (2014), privatization will end as a large-scale social and economic project, and proposals will be drawn up to amend Ukrainian law with regard to defining the functions of management bodies to provide for a transition from the privatization process to the sale of the state facilities as a function of managing state-owned facilities,"" reads the document. The program says that funds to participate in secondary share issues and prevent bankruptcy will be allocated so as to manage corporate rights that remain in state ownership. In 2011, privatization receipts to the national budget totaled UAH 11.49 billion, with the target figure being set at UAH 10 billion. The bulk of the receipts came from the sale of a 92.79% stake in telecoms giant Ukrtelecom for UAH 10.575 billion and a 25% stake in Kyivenergo for UAH 450 million. Privatization receipts from the beginning of 2012 have already totaled UAH 2.4 billion, or a quarter of the annual target, due to the acquisition by DTEK, controlled by Rinat Akhmetov, of a 40.061% stake in Donetskoblenergo for UAH 467.6 million and a 45.103% stake in Zakhidenergo for UAH 1.932 billion. Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) in 2011 sold $ 3.739 billion more than it bought on the interbank forex market, according to a posting on the Web site of the National Bank of Ukraine . Over the year the central bank bought $9.918 billion and sold $13.657 billion, reads the posting. As reported, in 2010, the NBU purchased $1.327 billion more than it sold on the interbank market, keeping the hryvnia from strengthening. According to the NBU, it bought euros, British pounds and Australian dollars worth a total of $625.8 million on the interbank market in December 2011, while it sold U.S. dollars to the tune of $456.2 million. As a result of this, the surplus of NBU interventions in December 2011 amounted to $169 6 million, while after November 2011 there was a deficit of $702.8 million. As reported, the negative balance of NBU interventions in December 2010 was $613.1 million. According to the NBU, total trading volumes on the interbank market in December 2011 decreased by 6.1% compared to November 2011, to $37.403 billion ($ 25.38 billion in December 2010). The total volume of trading in non-cash currency on the interbank market in 2011 grew by 90.6% compared to 2010, to $341.126 billion. The NBU also reported that the international reserves in 2011 shrank by 8.05%, or by $2.782 billion, to $31.795 billion.

Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – The Ukrainian Association of Investment Business (UAIB) says that stock market control procedures proposed by the National Commission for Securities and the Stock Market and sealed in a bill passed on January 10, 2012, at first reading will considerably complicate the creation and operation of its professional operators and will not bring the expected results. As the association said in a press release, it has sent a letter to Vitaliy Khomutynnyk, the chairman of the Verkhovna Rada committee on finance and banking, tax and customs policy, with a number of remarks on a bill drafted by the commission to amend some laws of Ukraine in terms of strengthening state controls over the activity of stock market operators. The association's remarks mainly concern changes in the deadline for applying sanctions, which are at variance with Article 250 of the Economic Code of Ukraine, and the list of documents that are to be submitted by a legal entity to the commission to receive a license for professional activity on the stock market. According to the association, requirements under which an applicant for a license should provide information about its organizational structure, equipment, computers, and a three-year business plan constitute interference in the applicant's activity. The association also believes that the terms stipulated in the bill for decision-making on the issuing of a license for professional activity on the stock market (three months and six months in case there is a nonresident owner or if the commission has doubts about the information provided) are groundlessly long. Moreover, the association says it is concerned over the procedure of state registration of changes in the bylaws of a legal entity engaged in professional activity on the stock market. Agreement of such changes with the commission should precede the procedure. The association claims that the requirements will considerably restrain the development of entrepreneurship in Ukraine. In addition, the association says that the announced procedure to buy or an increase a stake, which is 10% or more in a professional operator on the stock market may affect foreign companies' interest in investment in that sector. The UAIB also says it has remarks concerning the validity of a license for professional activity on the stock market. Under cabinet resolution No. 1097 dated October 26, 2011, this is unlimited. The requirement that professional stock market operators receive a new license, given that they already have existing licenses, throws doubt on the legitimacy of such licenses and the commission's licensing activity. ""Legal entities have received professional stock market operator's status under laws in effect and there is no grounds for reducing the validity of the already issued licenses,"" reads the press release. According to the UAIB, it proposes the following wording: ""The participants in the stock market that have licenses for professional activity on the stock market should carry out their activity in accordance with the issued license over the period of the validity of such a license.""

As the company said in a statement, trucks delivered to the CIS countries accounted for 71% of overall shipments, those delivered onto the domestic market accounted for 20% and the rest of the world for 9%. Seven hundred and forty trucks (82% of exports) were shipped to Russia, which was 60% up on 2010. The share of dumpers was 25% of the commodities supplied by AutoKrAZ to Russia, timber trucks and towing vehicles accounted for less than 25%, while the share of chassis was more than 50%. Thirty-nine trucks were supplied to Kazakhstan (three times up on 2010), 34 trucks to Azerbaijan, 26 trucks to Uzbekistan, and 15 trucks to Turkmenistan. As the company's press service said, in 2012 it managed to enter the markets of the Philippines and Rwanda, the countries where KrAZ haven't been supplied before, and restarted shipments to Macedonia and Thailand after a long break.

Norway is currently holding the 22nd round of licensing, which it plans to wrap up in the summer of this year. It accepted applications until January 11. The blocks that participated in the licensing round are mostly located in the border regions of Norway's continental shelf, in the Barents and Norwegian Seas.

Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov has said that the price of gas for Ukraine is five times higher than in the United States. ""An agreement on gas supplies from Russia, which is unfavorable for us, remains in effect. This price is five times higher than that in the United States.

Azarov said: ""We pay an addition $1 billion to Russia each month, but we could have spent this money on health and social needs."" Moscow, January 16 (Interfax) - The CEO of Russian gas giant Gazprom , Alexei Miller , told reporters on Monday that Kyiv's policy of seeking foreign investments for the country's gas transport system could lead to its ceasing to exist as a technical facility, and that it belongs in a ""museum."" ""If, as one hears in Ukraine, the gas transport system is a historical treasure, its place, apparently, is in a museum,"" Miller said. Asked what place Gazprom would give the Ukrainian pipe considering the construction of the South Stream pipeline passing Ukraine by, Miller said, ""That completely depends on the role Ukraine itself gives the gas-transport system."" Miller's comments come in the run-up to the next round of negotiations with Naftogaz Ukrainy slated for January 17. Kyiv is demanding new concession from Gazprom , without offering anything in return. The Russian company has never disguised its desire to take possession of Ukraine's gas-transport system, and has called that a condition for lowering prices for the country - as has already transpired with Belarus and Beltransgaz .

Kyiv, January 16 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Prices for milk on the Ukrainian market may drop by 30% if Russia introduces an embargo on Ukrainian cheese, according to President of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UAC) Alex Lissitsa. ""Private farms rather than agribusinesses will cut prices, which in turn may increase the slaughter of horned cattle,"" he said at a press conference in Kyiv on Friday. However, he says he considers the possibility of the introduction by Russia of such sanctions against Ukrainian dairy foods as slight. ""Judging from all that's happening, I don't believe they will apply any sanction against Ukraine. Now I'd call it nothing more than noise or nonsense,"" he said. According to Lissitsa, larger groups of Russian inspectors would have been sent to the Ukrainian factories whose products did not allegedly meet Russian standards if Russia intended to introduce sanctions against dairy foods from Ukraine. ""It is a fact that we're a net cheese exporting country, and of course if Russia closes the market to cheese supplied by Ukrainian enterprises, it will painfully hit our industry. Apparently, it would be the most painful hit among all the sectors of agriculture,"" he added. According to the UAC, Ukraine produced 139,000 tonnes of hard cheese in 11 months of 2011, which was 20% up on the same period of 2010. Fifty six thousand tonnes of those foods, or over 60% of overall production in Ukraine, were exported to Russia. In the first 11 months of 2011 Ukraine exported hard cheese and cheese products to Russia to the tune of $320 million, and the UAC forecasts that the amount may have reached $350 million over the whole of 2011. At the same time, Ukraine imports premium hard cheese worth $22 million. As reported, Gennady Onishchenko, the chief of the Russian Federal Consumer Protection Service (Rospotrebnadzor) and the chief state sanitary doctor of Russia, told Interfax that his agency, having analyzed the situation on the consumer market in the dairy product segment, and concluded that ""in the fourth quarter of 2011 there was a noticeable deterioration in the quality standards of the cheese supplied from Ukraine."" In particular, there was an increased level of palm oil in the cheese supplied to Russia by a number of Ukrainian manufacturers. By Russian standards, in particular, those pertaining to milk and dairy products, such products containing high levels of palm oil should be called a ""cheese product"" and not ""cheese."" ""The products from the Pyriatin cheese factory in Sumy region, the Velyky Burluk cheese factory in Kharkiv region and the Zvenyhorod cheese factory in Cherkasy region are of particular concern,"" Onishchenko said. He said that over 20 Ukrainian cheese factories supply products to the Russian market. In keeping with a ban introduced by Russia in the middle of 2012 following joint Russian and Ukrainian vet inspections, a mere 10 Ukrainian dairy producers have been authorized to supply their products to Russia. Milk Alliance, one of the largest dairy holdings in Ukraine, recently said it was perplexed at the statement made by Rospotrebnadzor's chief that the quality of cheese supplied by some Ukrainian companies to Russia, including the holding's Pyriatin cheese factory, had worsened.

"Scramble for the south Atlantic's oil; Explorers are rushing to the Falklands in the hope of more finds, reports Dominic Laurie in Port Stanley",Norway,"Until recently the only non-British voices you would hear in Stanley were passengers from visiting cruise ships, scientists about to embark on the big red British Antarctic survey ships, or migrant Chilean workers. That's no longer true. The Falkland Islands have struck oil — and the world has arrived. The Malvina House on Stanley's waterfront is an upmarket hotel and restaurant. It's a converted house that used to belong to Malvina Felton — it's not, as locals are at pains to point out, an unlikely homage to the Argentine name for the Falklands. Unsurprisingly, the hotel is where the oil workers and executives congregate. In the bar they talk about the prospects for their wells. It's a small place and hard not to overhear snippets of chat. The most common foreign accent in the bar is American. Last Wednesday evening, a group of executives from Anadarko of Texas, including one of its executive vicepresidents, Ian Cooling, dined with a team from Rockhopper, the London-listed explorer that thinks it has found nearly 500m recoverable barrels of oil to the north of the islands. Rockhopper wants a partner. Anadarko is not the only company that has met Rockhopper, but it could be significant that it was in town during the same week as Rockhopper's director of operations, Dave Bodecott, and that they discussed commercial rig operation scenarios at length the day after the dinner. Though commercial drilling is years away, the Falkland Islands is making money even from this exploration phase. Rockhopper, and other companies such as Desire Petroleum, have been using a rig tugged all the way from Aberdeen. Amazingly, Rockhopper struck lucky at its first attempt. Desire has drilled half a dozen wells and found nothing, though it does own part of another block where Rockhopper made a second discovery. The islands' government has been charging both acreage rental and, in the case of Rockhopper, discovery fees. The revenues helped turn an expected budget deficit last financial year into a surplus of £19m. Businesses have benefited too. ""We were more a seasonal hotel, now we are busy the whole year through,"" said Carl Stroud, manager of Malvina House. ""Our suppliers are happier because we are buying in more supplies — more fresh produce, meat, fish. It's one big chain really. Oil people like to spend. They like good food."" When, or if, oil starts to come out of the ground, the government will make money in two ways. First, a 9% royalty has to be paid on the market value of any oil. Second, corporation tax is payable on the profits from exploration and extraction. It is 26%. Despite the British government's large expenditure on maintaining a military base at Mount Pleasant near Stanley, its exchequer is not entitled to any of the proceeds from Falklands oil. If oil prices remain over $100 a barrel, and hundreds of millions of barrels are extracted, that's a huge windfall for a community of only 3,000. The government is looking at setting up a sovereign wealth fund, as Norway, a country with a small population but huge mineral wealth, has done to great effect. The Argentinians claim the proceeds should be theirs, and it is the growing probability that the Falklands will yield commercial quantities of oil that is behind the increase in political rhetoric in recent weeks. Stephen Luxton, director of mineral resources for the Falkland Islands, said it was ""highly unlikely there would be any kind of sharing arrangement with them"". Rockhopper said it will start commercial production in 2016. It plans to develop its Sea Lion field with a giant oil tanker moored over it. The ship will be fitted with a drilling rig and have capacity to store 2m to 3m barrels of oil, which would then be offloaded to other tankers. Most of the oil jobs, in other words, will stay offshore. Only a few dozen oil workers are expected to be ashore at the peak of operations. However, the wider onshore community is hoping for a windfall. Roger Spink, the president of the islands' chamber of commerce, said: ""The opportunities [provided by the oil industry] are enormous for all sorts of businesses, from transport companies to guest houses, the retail sector and logistics. There will be jobs all over the place."" Although the Falklands cover an area about two-thirds the size of Wales, most people live in Stanley. Last week, Rockhopper launched a social impact study, using consultants from Plexus Energy. An appeal for views was launched through an advertisement in the Penguin, the local newspaper. The firm wants to help residents to ""mitigate negative impacts"" of its arrival, and ""enhance and maximise"" the benefits. Kyle Biggs runs Endurance Tours, and takes tourists to battlefield sites, penguin colonies and other attractions on the islands. ""I think there will be a big surge in tourism if we get an oil boom,"" he said. ""It will raise the profile of the Falklands, attract more people, and thus get better facilities for the tourists."" Julie Halliday owns Studio 52, a graphic design, photography and clothing business based in a pretty white cabin on the shore at Stanley. ""When workers come off the oil rigs and spend a few days in town, they tend to want something to remind them of where they have been,"" she said. ""I think they tend to earn pretty good money, and it would be good if they come and spend some of it in my shop. I'd like a piece of that,"" she added, laughing. Spink conceded that the islanders had been disappointed before. Several companies, including Shell, explored the north Falklands basin 14 years ago but didn't come up with anything viable. Other oil explorers have found inspiration in Rockhopper's success. Two companies — Falkland Oil and Gas and Borders and Southern — have raised tens of millions to explore an area south of the islands (Rockhopper is in the north). Argos Resources, another London listed firm, has plans to drill wells on a separate block in the northern basin. Their chances of success are remote. Oil isn't the only industry on the island that faces uncertainty. Squid fishing accounts for 75% of exports and more than half of GDP. There are two main sort of squid: the smaller loligo, and the larger — and locals say less tasty — illex. The illex spawns off the coast of Argentina, and then moves into international waters as it matures. This season the Argentine government told its fishermen to begin the catch earlier than normal on December 1, potentially reducing the number of mature squid that can be caught by Falklands vessels. The 55-metre factory trawler John Cheek, crewed by 35, was moored at the jetty in Stanley harbour. On its deck, managing director Stuart Wallis was angry. He said the Argentinians were irresponsible. ""They are trying various manoeuvres to stop the mature fish reaching our zone."" One side-effect of the Falklands dispute is the lack of an international fisheries agreement in the southwest Atlantic. This has led to overfishing on a huge scale. For example, the southern blue whiting, once one of the most abundant fish there, is now commercially extinct. As for the illex squid, the government used to bank on £16m in licence fees every year from it. Now it expects nothing. John Barton, director of natural resources for the Falkland Islands, said: ""We used to have really quite good relations with Argentina on fisheries conservation for the 15 years after the conflict. We did joint research. So it's rather depressing now that, 30 years after the conflict, we don't have those relations."" He doesn't blame Argentina alone for overfishing, but adds ""having some sort of bilateral or multilateral measures to enable conservation measures to be put in place would be very helpful."" Fishing isn't the only arena in which the Argentinians are putting economic pressure on the Falklands. The islands used to have a container ship link to Uruguay and Chile. But that was lost. Islanders blame Argentine pressure on their South American neighbours. A new link has been opened to Brazil, but some business figures in the Falklands want this kept quiet, lest the Argentinians put paid to that too. There's only one scheduled flight a week, to Punta Arenas in Chile. With all this uncertainty, the islands are trying to diversify their economy. There are 500,000 sheep on the Falklands, traditionally almost all used for their wool. But the wool price fluctuates wildly, leaving farmers nervous. So, the abattoir a few miles outside Stanley has had a refit, and improved quality control and mechanisation now means thousands more Falklands lambs are eaten in European restaurants. Farmers increasingly have another option to wool, said its boss, John Ferguson. There are also plans for a new waterfront at Stanley, so the 50,000 passengers who disembark from the cruise ships every year have a better experience. The government is working on a new air charter link direct to Miami so the Falklands can be the start and end of many cruise journeys, which would be good for hotels, restaurants and taxis. It's expensive to get many goods, especially fresh produce, in the islands. Single items of fruit and vegetables often cost more than £1. Half a pineapple can cost £6. Other aspects of the cost of living are also expensive. The islands have no fibre-optic cable. Broadband is via satellite, which costs many households an eye-watering £150 a month. However, despite the rising cost of living and the political tensions, the mood is upbeat. At 0.5% at the last count, the Falklands have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world. The 15 and 16 year olds who go away to Britain to do A-levels and go to university tend to come back after their studies. The oil industry is widely welcomed.Even the environmental lobby on the islands is positive. James Fenton, chief executive of Falklands Conservation, said that to remain economically viable ""the islands need to keep as much income as possible from as many sources as possible. The oil development is going ahead regardless of whether it is environmentally good or bad"". However, despite that sense of inevitability, he felt that because the prevailing winds around the Falklands tend to blow from the southwest, the risk of disaster was low. ""The current exploration is taking place in areas that are probably the least environmentally sensitive in terms of potential spills."" This weekend another exploration rig, the self-powered Leif Erikson, arrives. Falkland Oil and Gas and Borders and Southern will use it this time in the south Falkland basin. Parts of the area have been seismically mapped but it is nonetheless a shot in the dark. Even if Rockhopper's find ends up being the first and last discovery off the Falklands, the 3,000 people in this tight-knit community could soon become rich beyond their wildest dreams. '' COMPANIES WILL PAY ISLANDERS A 9% ROYALTY ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ANY OIL THEY EXTRACT"
Brazilian equities burst back into life,Norway,"In January, the first sign that normal life was returning to São Paulo's long-suffering equities market was the reappearance of a term that investors had almost forgotten the meaning of - the initial public offering. Brasil Travel, a tourism operator, and Seabras, the Brazilian unit of Norway-based global oil services company, SeaDrill, said they planned to sell shares. Although Seabras' R$1.7bn IPO was later delayed for two months while the company worked on its regulatory filings, the announcements of the first equity offerings in months were taken as a positive sign that Latin America's largest market was finally getting back to business. After falling to a low of 48,668.29 points in August last year as the European crisis gained momentum, the benchmark Bovespa index was trading above 65,000 points on Monday - a gain of 33.6 per cent. In dollar terms, it gained 20 per cent in January alone compared with December and 11 per cent in local currency terms. ""The external scenario is improving and the domestic environment is pretty robust,"" says Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist at Banco West LB in São Paulo. ""All of this points to a rebound in the Bovespa, which since the crisis in 2008 has not recovered to its previous high of 73,000 points."" While the resurgence of the Bovespa has as much to do with global risk appetite as domestic factors, there are growing hopes that the market will sustain its recovery this year. In spite of a firm start to 2011, the year turned into an annus horribilis for the Bovespa index as global risk appetite turned against the large emerging markets, with Brazil trailing Chinese and Indian stocks down. Brazil also had its own issues to contend with. After the government reported 7.5 per cent gross domestic product growth in 2010, the highest in decades, inflation shot through the upper end of the central bank's target range of 4.5 per cent plus or minus 2 percentage points to reach a high of 7.3 per cent last September. The central bank was forced to begin a tightening cycle that raised the benchmark Selic interest rate to 12.5 per cent. Investors dumped financial sector stocks as non-performing loans and consumer delinquencies began to rise. Construction companies, particularly residential builders, once also big favourites, also took a hit. Fears over the Greek crisis shook confidence in global growth, which hit the Bovespa's biggest constituents, state-controlled oil company Petrobras and Vale, the world's second-largest miner. Concern mounted at the end of August when Brazil's central bank abruptly reversed its tightening cycle, slashing rates by 50 basis points. The bank cited uncertainty in Europe for the move. But it soon became clear that Brazil's domestic situation was also worrying. In the third quarter, the economy contracted marginally as industrial production shrank. What followed was a series of rapid interest rate cuts, culminating in the latest reduction in the Selic last month, with the central bank promising it would take interest rates into the single-digits. For investors in Brazil's stock market, the easier monetary policy is producing dividends. While Brazilian industrial production remains weak, unemployment is at record lows and the better global outlook is leading to hopes of a resurgence in the commodities sector. ""Still riding the wave of excess global liquidity with heavy flows of foreign capital into the country, the main index of [the] Brazilian stock market closed higher for the fifth consecutive week,"" said Brazilian brokerage Ativa Corretora de Valores, of last week's trade. Among the stocks that have recovered are the property, building and commodities sectors. OGX, the oil flagship of Eike Batista, Brazil's richest man, has also been an outperformer after it began pumping its first crude last week. Most analysts caution that the market may not be completely out of the woods yet. If the global economy does improve, the demon of last year - inflation - may stage a comeback. Although it finished 2011 exactly at the upper end of the central bank's range, or 6.5 per cent, it has remained stubbornly high at 6.4 per cent in January compared with a year earlier. ""The fear that the market has now is that these guys are going to have to reverse their cuts,"" says Bret Rosen, senior credit strategist with Standard Chartered. For now though things are looking up. The next question on investors' minds is whether new issuances will pick up again. After the Brasil Travel and Seabras announcements, BM&FBovespa;, the company that runs Brazil's equity market, estimates there are 40 other companies waiting to list. ""An improving economic outlook, foreign capital flows and a reduction in risk perception are again honing market appetite for equity offerings,"" said Itaú-Unibanco the large Brazilian bank."
BP ups dividend and backs drive for deeper wells,Norway,"BP has raised its dividend for the first time in a year as it continues to recover from the Deepwater Horizon disaster – and defended its ambitions to drill deeper wells than ever before. The oil major reported full–year profits for 2011 of $23.9bn (£15.1bn), compared with the $4.9bn loss it made in 2010 – the year of the accident that killed 11 men and spilled millions of barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico. The figures use the oil industry's ""replacement cost profit"" measure, which strips out changes in the value of the inventory. The 14pc dividend rise, taking payments to 8 cents per share, provided some cheer for investors who saw payouts suspended after the accident and remain at 7 cents since they resumed a year ago. However the dividend, payable on March 30, remains well below its pre–suspension levels of 14 cents, when BP accounted for about £1 in every £6 paid to UK investors. The increase surprised some analysts, who thought it could be politically unwise ahead of the trial into the Gulf of Mexico accident, due to begin on February 27. Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, reiterated that the company would be willing to settle the claims – but only on ""fair and reasonable terms"". He said: ""If this is not possible, we are preparing vigorously for trial."" BP had always had a ""bias toward settling and moving on"" he said, admitting ""uncertainty"" deterred some investors. ""We have many people who do say, 'We are interested in investing in BP but not until all this is behind you'."" Mr Dudley said BP's longterm strategy would ""play to its strengths"" in exploration, focusing on ""deep water, gas value chains and giant fields"". BP was ""actively investigating"" new technologies that could aid it in ""drilling deeper wells and overcoming the challenges of developing and exploiting ever higher pressure resources"". Questioned on the wisdom of such ambitions after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, Mr Dudley said BP ""should not stop dead in the water from progressing the very things that are at the heart of our industry"". BP's deepest well to date was Tiber in the Gulf of Mexico, at 35,055 ft in 2009. Mr Dudley also suggested BP could attempt further exploration offshore in the Arctic, after its failed tie–up with Russian oil giant Rosneft last year. ""The Arctic is a very large area, in Norway, Canada, the US and Russia, and I'm sure down the road we may be working in those places,"" he said. However Mr Dudley, who had previously expressed surprise the Gulf accident had not created more difficulties for BP in securing exploration leases, suggested that it could still hinder ambitions in the Arctic. ""There's no denying it, after our accident there will be much more focus on us if we move into the Arctic, so it is not the driver for us as we move on,"" he said. He described the attempted Rosneft deal as ""a good idea"" but added: ""We have got lots of ideas."" BP had a ""plate full of great exploration activities"" elsewhere, he said. The company was ""on the right path"" and would stick to the strategy unveiled in October, when Mr Dudley hailed a ""turning point"" and set out plans to increase shareholder returns, divest non–core assets and increase cashflow. After 2011's ""year of consolidation"", 2012 would be ""a year of increasing investment and milestones"", including doubling the number of exploration wells drilled, having eight rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico by the end of the year, and completing payments into the Gulf of Mexico trust fund. Mr Dudley highlighted progress in cleaning up the Gulf: ""The beaches are clean, the water is open, the seafood is as good as ever. 2011 has been a great year for tourism on the Gulf Coast. I would encourage all of you to visit."" BP's fourth–quarter results beat expectations with underlying replacement cost profit, excluding exceptional items such as legal settlements, of $4.99bn, against consensus of $4.87bn . The shares fell 3p to 486½p. Questor: B6 BP 650p Close 486.5p 550 450 350 2007 250 2008 2009 2010 2011"
The 'petrolization' of Canada's economy,Norway,"You know that old saying, ""When the U.S. sneezes, Canada catches a cold."" It still applies. The United States remains our biggest trading partner. What happens there affects everything from our tourism to our exports. But Canada is now facing a bigger threat to its economic health. It's called Dutch Disease - and it's complicated by Prime Minister Stephen Harper's newly acquired China syndrome. Stung by U.S. President Barack Obama's rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, Harper is looking to China's government-owned oil companies. Dutch Disease isn't about tulips or wooden shoes or even sick elm trees. It's about Canada's steady conversion to a petro-state, fuelled by the rapid development of Alberta's oilsands. It means that, more and more, Canada's economy will be subject to the price of oil. Coined by The Economist in 1977, ""Dutch Disease"" describes what happened to the Netherlands after natural gas fields were discovered off its shores. The little country became so economically entangled with its resource industry, its manufacturing sector tanked. ""Ontario is probably the province that has suffered the most from this,"" says University of Ottawa economist Serge Coulombe, co-author of a massive study on the impact of Dutch Disease on Canadian jobs, published last fall. ""The biggest losers are typically the white males who had all those great jobs in manufacturing, much like in the U.S.,"" he says, adding Canadian salaries and environmental standards make our manufactured exports less attractive, especially as our dollar strengthens. ""If we want to compete with China we have to be very, very smart. It is very, very difficult."" In his report, Coulombe and his co-researchers determined that our petro-currency was responsible for 42 per cent of job losses between 2002 and 2007. That translates to at least 140,000 manufacturing jobs gone as a direct result of the oilsands development. It didn't get any better after that. Our manufactured exports dropped another 12.6 per cent between the second quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2011. If Dutch Disease is allowed to spread, Coulombe and other economists warn, Canada's ailing manufacturing sector will face still more job losses, while consumers, farmers and non-oil producing industries will feel increasing pain through inflation and gas prices at the pump. It all started when the price of oil started rising in 2002, tripling through the decade. The long-unprofitable oilsands, which require the expensive and water-intense extraction of tarry bitumen, suddenly became economically feasible. That increased oilsands development boosted crude exports. By 2006, oil became our biggest export, displacing autos and auto parts. The loonie surged against the weakening U.S. dollar. That made our manufactured exports - long dependent on a low Canadian dollar - more expensive. And that cost factory workers jobs. Over the past year, alarm bells have been sounding about Dutch Disease. Last April, Montreal-based MRB Partners (Macro Research Board), an independent global investment research firm, warned of the ""petrolization"" of Canada. ""Canada has often been referred to in jest as the 51st state, due to its historical reliance on the U.S. as a key export market,"" wrote MRB partner Phillip Colmar. ""However, it is becoming more accurate to regard Canada as another province of China."" ""You have 1.3 billion people right now that are growing at an unprecedented rate,"" explains Coulombe. ""That creates a huge demand for natural resources."" And Harper is eager to meet that demand, saying it is ""increasingly clear that it is in Canada's national interest to diversify our energy markets."" Over the past two years, China has invested some $15 billion in Alberta's oilsands. It wants the bitumen moved via the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline to the B.C. coast, where it will be loaded into tankers. That crude, rated the dirtiest on earth, will travel through our most environmentally sensitive areas, critics charge. Earlier this month, economist Robyn Allan submitted a 74-page analysis of the Northern Gateway proposal to the National Energy Board Joint Review Panel considering the project. Allan, a former Insurance Corporation of British Columbia CEO, makes a case that if the project is approved, the Canadian economy will be hit by ""an inflationary oil price shock"" - as well as interprovincial conflicts. ""Right now 95 per cent of the oil is in Alberta but 75 per cent of the manufacturing jobs are in Ontario and Quebec,"" she says. ""If you have a policy that deliberately supports Alberta at the expense of Eastern Canada, then you're stretching the national fabric. ""The jobs are not there, the benefits to Canada are not there,"" she maintains. ""We are going to experience even more upward pressure on the Canadian dollar; we are going to have even more intense division between Eastern and Western Canada."" Yet another study published last fall, this time by Montreal's Institute for Research on Public Policy, emphasized that ""resource booms don't last forever"" and that Canada should maintain a competitive manufacturing industry. Economists suggest there are ways to cure Dutch Disease, or at least lessen its impact. Canada could invest in other industries, including green technologies. Or it could go the foreign currency route, by investing abroad. That's what Norway does with its oil wealth. By creating a petroleum fund with foreign currency, it also pays down its debt, which reduces the upward pressure on the krone and protects the country's exports. But, as Coulombe says, ""We cannot do that in Canada because we have a sophisticated and complicated federal and provincial system and it is the provinces that own the natural resources."" Alberta doesn't seem particularly disposed to help Eastern Canada, which, ironically, imports most of its oil from the Middle East, Mexico and Norway. ""When the federal government talks about diversifying our markets, we shouldn't be looking to northeast Asia, we should be looking to Canada,"" says Allan. ""We hear we have to diversify to Asia because Asia needs to protect its source of supply so it's not dependent on Saudi Arabia. But Canada also has a dependency on Middle Eastern countries. ""So why are our federal leaders so concerned about everybody else's oil security and not Canada's? We should be looking at what we can do to help Eastern Canada avoid the unpredictable and volatile (prices) and perhaps supply restrictions that are going to happen in the years to come."" Coulombe fears little or nothing can or will be done to protect Canadian consumers and manufacturers from the effects of Dutch Disease. ""I don't think the manufacturing sector will come back; I think we have to accept that,"" says Coulombe. ""The growth of China is like a big train. Canada will be more and more a country that will live on its natural resources."" There's another old Canadian expression, attributed to the late University of Toronto economist Harold Innis. He compared Canadians to ""hewers of wood and drawers of water"" because we were dependent for so long on exporting our raw materials to buy back value-added manufactured goods. Today, we are selling our oil to buy back gasoline, jet fuel, asphalt, plastic and other petroleum-based products. That would make us ""deliverers of crude and drawers of water."""
WISH YOU WERE HERE,Norway,"TOURISM bosses in Glasgow know there is only one way to get people to come to the city – go out and tell them what it has to offer. That’s why the city’s marketing chiefs are working in France, Spain, Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands spreading the news. Tourism is big business and those five countries alone generate a quarter of the foreign visitors who jet into Scotland’s biggest city every year. And together they spend a whopping £60million on accommodation, food, drink, shopping and nightlife. That’s a lot of money and Glasgow City Marketing Bureau would like more to boost the local economy. For that reason Glasgow’s tourism chiefs launched international marketing and communications campaigns last month in a twin effort to boost visitor numbers and support new air routes to the city. They have turned the spotlight on Glasgow’s rich tapestry of cultural attractions, major events, conference facilities and new hotels, as well as the key developments taking place as the city prepares to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Scottish music was used to woo journalists in the Netherlands when marketing chiefs arrived at the Lloyd Hotel in Amsterdam to profile easyJet’s new direct flights between the Dutch capital and Glasgow and the new Scottish Hydro Arena at the SECC. Mull singer-songwriter Sorren Maclean and Oban guitarist and singer Finlay Wells – known in musical circles as the Deadly Duo – entertained the media fresh from their appearance at Celtic Connections. The Netherlands is Glasgow’s eighth biggest foreign market. It’s estimated that 22,000 Dutch tourists come to the city every year and spend an average of £9.2m. The Spanish also love Glasgow, with 44,000 jetting to the city every year, and spending £23m. Marketing chiefs joined VisitScotland to bring writers from four Spanish media publications – with a combined 1.2 million readers – to Glasgow. Among the attractions highlighted were Jet2.com’s flights to Barcelona which begin next month and Air Nostrum’s twice-weekly flights between Glasgow and Madrid. And it wasn’t just Scots who flocked to Celtic Connections. Writers from five French fashion, lifestyle and travel magazines – with more than seven million readers – were flown in for the cultural celebration. The marketing bureau also promoted direct flights between Glasgow and France, including easyJet’s service to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Jet2.com’s links with Nice Cote d’Azur. Press advertisements are also planned in the coming weeks. Each year more than 61,000 tourists from France flock to Scotland’s biggest city, where they spend an estimated £18.4m. And Glasgow is currently being heavily marketed on the radio, in the media and online across Norway now that Eastern Airways has launched direct flights to Stavanger. Glasgow attracts 17,000 Norwegians every year who bring more than £7m into the city’s economy. Iceland is also about to get the VIP treatment with the launch of a “seeglasgow” website and TV and radio adverts after the bureau’s communications team jetted to the capital Reykjavik last month for the annual Mid-Atlantic Seminar. The event, organised by airline Icelandair, attracts more than 300 delegates from the travel industry in Europe and North America. During the year, bureau bosses will also be focusing on America, Canada and Germany, as well as Australia and New Zealand and the oil-rich Arabs of Dubai. The groundwork has already started. Canadian celebrity chef Massimo Capra has visited Glasgow to film a new Canadian TV series, Gourmet Escapes. Dubbed Canada’s Jamie Oliver, he teamed up with Glasgow chef Colin Clydesdale of West End restaurants Ubiquitous Chip and Stravaigin to discover the city’s culinary offerings. The show, to be broadcast later this year, is expected to be watched by 8.5m viewers. The drive to bring more tourists to Glasgow has the wholehearted backing of city council leader Gordon Matheson, who is also bureau chairman. He said: “These are tremendously exciting times for Glasgow with major new infrastructure and hotel developments ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games providing the city with the materials to generate significant in-bound tourism and inward investment. “It remains as important as ever that the story of Glasgow’s regeneration and metamorphosis into one of Europe’s most vibrant and stylish cities is told and it is Glasgow City Marketing Bureau’s role to ensure that this story is communicated to a global audience. “Cities across Europe are facing challenging and difficult times at present, which is why it has never been more important that Glasgow occupies its place on the global stage as one of the world’s great cities.” gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk"
Pristine Norwegian fishing area divided on prospect of oil,Norway,"Looking for oil outside your front door may sound exciting, but in the idyllic Arctic archipelago of Lofoten, one of Norway's best fishing areas, the prospect of the black gold has sparked heated debate. ""This issue has split the local community and the nation as a whole down the middle,"" said Brigt Dale, who recently completed his doctorate on the controversy at the northern Norwegian University of Tromsoe. The question of whether Norway should allow prospecting in the waters around Lofoten's 1,000 or so islands -- whose snow-dusted, jagged black mountains rise up like frozen waves in between small, colourful fishing villages -- has pitted environmentalists and some fishermen against the country's mighty energy sector. Many locals meanwhile side with the energy companies, insisting oil is needed to create work and growth in the archipelago, whose 25,000-odd inhabitants are facing a decline in jobs in the vital fishing industry, which has sustained habitation here for thousands of years. Although fishing catches have grown, Norway's total number of fishing vessels has plummeted from 120,000 in 1946 to 12,000 today. ""Everyone agrees that we can create value and jobs, and that people in Lofoten need both,"" said Erik Karlstroem, the head of North Energy, an oil and gas company focused on northern Norway, insisting: ""The fishing industry cannot maintain the residence pattern in this area."" Oil and gas production along Norway's long coastline has over the past four decades catapulted the once impoverished Scandinavian country to become one of the world's richest nations, ranking seventh in terms of oil exports and second for natural gas. But while southwestern towns bordering the prosperous North Sea fields have long boomed, and wealth has begun flooding into the Arctic region bordering Barents Sea oil and gas fields, a small area sandwiched in the middle remains off limits to prospecting. Seismic blast studies have shown the Arctic waters off Lofoten could hold around 1.3 billion barrels of oil, but it is impossible to get a real idea without test drilling. However, Norway's left-leaning government is deeply split on the prospect of Lofoten oil and the idea of an official impact study -- which comes before test drilling -- on the consequences of prospecting there is so explosive the coalition has put the decision on hold until after the next general elections in 2013. That is a good thing, according to Ranghild Gjaerum, who heads an action committee opposed to oil and gas exploration in the Norwegian Sea waters around Lofoten, and the Vesteraalen and Senja islands to the north. ""Opening up to production would be disastrous,"" she said, pointing to the fragile ecosystem in the area and its importance to Norway's fishing industry, since millions of east-Arctic cod -- the world's largest cod stock -- come here to spawn each winter. A major problem when considering oil and gas prospecting off Lofoten is the area's extremely narrow sea shelf that ends in a steep drop of about 3,000 metres. Since both fishing and potential drilling need to be done in the shallower waters on the shelf, many fear oil and gas installations would heavily encroach on fishing territory. Oil industry insiders insist seabed installations, not platforms, would be used to ensure the drilling is invisible from the Lofoten islands, which in summer crawl with tourists eager to soak up its pristine beauty, and to avoid disturbing fishing. Yet seismic blast activity on the shelf in recent years to map the topography and to try to determine what riches may lie beneath the seabed has been seen disturbing fish and has at times blocked fishermen from leaving port. ""It is really hard to imagine how the fishermen will be able to coexist with the oil industry carrying out seismic blasting on that tiny shelf... There isn't enough room,"" Gjaerum said. Oerjan Robertsen, who heads the local LoVe Petro lobbying group, acknowledged that so far the seismic blasting had not always been handled as well as it could have. ""There is a need to cooperate with the fishing industry and to find the times of year when the fishing industry is the least vulnerable,"" he said, insisting strict regulations on blast times would be introduced. Undoubtedly, the most worrying issue with pumping up oil so close to land is that in the case of a spill authorities would have less than a day to react before the toxic goo reaches shore, compared to many days if the same were to happen in the North or Barents Sea fields. ""The ocean currents are also strong here and different from anything Norway's oil industry has tackled previously,"" Dale pointed out, adding: ""The great fear on the environmental side is that we won't have the competency to handle accidents and spills this close to land."" Increased shipping activity to and from oil installations as well as well as chemicals discharged in the production phase also has environmentalists worried. North Energy's Karlstroem admitted that even though the chance of an accident was ""infinitely small"" thanks to strict regulations and top-notch technology, the possibility of a spill so close to land was frightening and the industry needed to show it was taking the issue seriously. Experts, he said, were busy working out how to significantly speed up reaction time in the case of an accident, and had found ""an obvious solution is to use the fishermen's help."" Many fishermen, who would be compensated for carrying emergency oil clean-up equipment on their vessels, were keen on the idea, he said. ""We basically need to work together and find a solution everyone can live with,"" he said. nl/po/ns"
First North Sea contracts for provider of offshore oil & gas services GSP,Norway,"Bucharest, March 12 /Agerpres / - Provider of offshore oil & gas services Grup Servicii Petroliere (GSP) won its first two offshore contracts in the North Sea, both awarded by Dutch company Wintershall Noordzee; one is an offshore drilling contract, the other a pipelay contract, daily Bursa reports on Monday. The first contract refers to the rig GSP Saturn, which is currently located on the continental shelf of Tunisia, and which will be relocated to provide offshore drilling services under a long-term contract that will develop for the beginning in the Dutch sector, reads a GSP statement. GSP Saturn is scheduled to start the drilling operations in May 2012. The agreement is for an initial 12-month period. The second contract refers to DNV class pipelay vessel GSP Falcon, which is expected to mobilize to the North Sea in June 2012 and, after the completion of a prelay survey, to begin the installation of a 30km pipeline that will reroute the production from the existing Q4-C platform and will connect subsea to the pipeline which currently connects the Q8-A platform to the port of IJmuiden. 'The recently signed contracts mark the arrival of GSP in the North Sea market, in addition to our existing markets of the Black Sea, the Mediterranean, the Russian Federation and Mexico. Working from our established offices in Rotterdam and Aberdeen we anticipate further growth of our share of this market, and plan to bring additional assets to meet the North Sea demand,' said GSP CEO Stuart Oakley. GSP, a member of the Ploiesti-based Upetrom Group (north of Bucharest), controlled by businessman Gabriel Comanescu, provides integrated offshore drilling services. According to its website, Upetrom Group companies operate in onshore and offshore drilling, offshore construction, oilfield equipment production, design engineering, as well as in the tourism sector. Today, Upetrom Group has 3,000 employees and is operating worldwide with representative offices in Romania, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Norway.

Brazil oil and gas attract foreign groups,Norway,"When Britain's Prince Harry last week rode the cable car to the top of Sugar Loaf Mountain, one of Rio de Janeiro's biggest tourist attractions, it was hardly surprising that BG Group was among the companies at the event showcasing its presence in the Latin American market. The natural gas company is the largest UK investor in Brazil, with $5bn tied up chiefly in five offshore blocks off the country's south-eastern coast. It also has a majority holding in Brazil's largest natural gas distributor, Comgás, and a stake in a gas pipeline between Latin America's largest economy and its neighbour, Bolivia. ""BG Group has been present in Brazil for over 18 years,"" the company said at the event to promote UK interests. But BG and other longstanding investors in the country no longer have the market to themselves. Since Shell became the first international operator to start oil and gas production in Brazil in 2003, ending the former monopoly of state-owned oil operator Petrobras, at least 36 foreign companies have entered the country's upstream market, according to Ernst & Young. Chinese companies, particularly oil and petrochemical group Sinopec, are now among the largest investors in Brazilian oil and gas. Sinopec in November paid a total of $5.2bn for a 30 per cent stake in the Brazilian assets of Galp Energia, the Portuguese energy company. This follows Sinopec's $7.1bn purchase of the Brazilian assets of Repsol YPF in 2010. Among the other Chinese groups, Sinochem has a $3.1bn stake in a field off Brazil's south-eastern coast operated by Norway's Statoil. Most other international oil majors are represented in Brazil as well - aside from Shell and BG, Chevron and ExxonMobil have interests in blocks in the country and BP has bought $7bn in assets from Devon Energy of the US that include interests in Brazil. But Brazil also comes with its risks, as Chevron discovered after a small oil leak at a field near Rio de Janeiro last year provoked an outcry from all levels of government accompanied by a $10.6bn lawsuit."
NEW EEA GRANTS PROGRAM PRESENTED,Norway,"TALLINN - After a long haul of planning, the programs for the EEA/Norway Grants for the new 5-year period were presented at a launch meeting in Tallinn this week. The amount to be distributed among Estonian projects is 48 million euros. For the three Baltic countries the total amount is 206 million euros. The programs will soon be presented to the public by the various program operators, inviting organizations and public entities to apply for project support, the EEA Grants secretariat told The Baltic Times. The EEA Grants and Norway Grants were established in connection with the enlargement of the EU in 2004. As non-EU members, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are obliged by the EEA (European Economic Area) agreement to give financial support in order to reduce disparities in the European Economic Area (which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The EEA Grants amount to 988 million euros in the current period and aims to support projects in the 12 newest EU member countries and Greece, Portugal and Spain. Norway contributes around 95 percent of the total funding, with Iceland and Liechtenstein contributing the remaining 5 percent. The Norway Grants represent  800 million euros in the current period. The funding is allocated to the 12 newest EU member states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, and is wholly contributed by Norway. In combination both Grants amount to 1.79 billion euros. The funding is allocated between the receiving countries, based on their population and GDP per capita. For example, Poland will receive 578 million euros and Malta 4.5 million euros. Each country has its special focus areas. For Estonia, environment and public health are the most important focus areas for the 48 million euro allocation. In Latvia and Lithuania the focus areas are environment, adaptation to climate change and cultural heritage, both countries also having substantial allocations in the sectors of justice and home affairs. All three countries focus on civil society through a special fund for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Of the new programs in Estonia, more than a quarter of the total funding (12.9 million euros) is earmarked for programs on integrated marine and inland water management and green industry innovation. The second largest priority area, public health initiatives, seeks to improve access to and quality of health services. Other programs include research and scholarships, cultural and natural heritage. In Estonia, the Ministry of Finance has the overall responsibility for issuing the grants, but each program is managed by a national program operator who announces the program and evaluates the project applications. “Each funding period is developed in steps. In 2009, the donors negotiated with the EU; country-specific negotiations followed, and in mid-2011 agreements were signed with Estonia. Next Estonia started to prepare its programs, and this is what is being presented during this week’s launch in Tallinn. The funding will run until 2016,” says Sigve Soldal Bjorstad, press contact for the EEA and Norway Grants in Brussels. Norwegian organizations and state institutions will be involved in 10 different programs. Partners from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway will also contribute to a scholarship program. “By facilitating partnerships between important institutions on both sides, such as the cooperation between the Norwegian climate and pollution agency and the Estonian Ministry of Environment, we open up a new dimension of sharing knowledge and experience across borders which both parties will benefit from,” says Bjorstad. Other institutions the Estonian program operators will co-operate with include the Norwegian Cultural Heritage Board, Norwegian Directorate of Health, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and several other institutions. EEA /Norway Grants have so far been distributed to more than 200 projects in Estonia, reports the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of renewable biofuels in the boiler house of OU Lihula Soojus, was one of many projects completed in Estonia during the last period. The 650,000 euro project, conducted by municipal heating company OU Lihula Soojus and supported with a 50 percent grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, swapped the area’s energy production from oil-shale to straw and wood, reducing estimated CO2 emissions by 98 percent. Former Estonian Minister of Finance Ivari Padar was present at the project’s formal launch. Padar commended Lihula parish for using local fuels as the source for heating. Norway’s Ambassador to Estonia was also present at the event. Renovation of 9-year-old manor houses in rural Estonia succeeded in preserving historical buildings as well as turning them into modern educational and cultural centers for the local communities. The project was supported by the Grants, which were, according to Anton Parn, undersecretary at the Estonian Ministry for Culture, vital in reaching the goals of the project. In addition to the cost-efficiency of combining several functions in the same building, the ‘Forgotten Manors’ have become an annual highlight during the tourist season. Between 2004-09 a total of 1,240 projects, programs and funds to the tune of 1.3 billion euros were supported in 15 countries by the EEA Grants and Norway Grants. Twelve external reviews and evaluations have been commissioned to external consultants, of which 11 have been concluded. Additional reviews and evaluations have been carried out by the beneficiary states.  "
Falklands looks to future amid hopes for oil revenue,Norway,"As the Falkland Islands prepares to mark Monday's 30th anniversary of a bitter war, its residents are instead looking to the future amid hopes of an oil boom. A war of words continues between Argentina and Britain, both of whom have claimed sovereignty over the islands since the British settled there in 1833. ""We want to look up, into the future, moving forward,"" Jan Cheek, a member of the Falklands Legislative Assembly, told AFP. The current tense political situation is ""an inconvenience, it's a nuisance, it will pass,"" Cheek said. She was referring to what the locals, who call themselves ""kelpers,"" say is a blockade by Argentina which has sought to persuade its neighbours to bar enter to ships bearing the Falklands flag, and against their fishing industry. It is also proposing that the weekly airline flights to the Falkland Islands from Chile should take alternate routes. The Argentine government announced this month it intends to sue oil companies operating in the archipelago. But if Argentina represents the past for the islanders, the promise of oil is raising their expectations for the future. ""Hopefully, the first barrel of Falklands oil will come out in the second quarter of 2016,"" Lewis Clifton, managing director of Byron Marine, told AFP. Clifton, whose company manages port logistics in the capital, Stanley, said five companies are doing oil exploration in waters near the Falklands. One of the companies, the British firm Rockhopper, claims to have discovered an oil reserve it estimated at more than one billion barrels, although a more definitive estimate is expected soon. The potential revenue figures are astronomical for a territory of just over 3,000 people, who until recently survived largely on wool production from the sheep which graze 12,000 square kilometers of windswept land. They appear to stand on the threshold of becoming the South Atlantic's version of the Middle East's oil-rich Qatar. Local government officials have been studying oil production methods they hope would not trample their lifestyles, or damage the islands' eco-system which supports some rare wildlife from penguins to albatross and even elephant seals. ""Oil production in the Shetland islands is very much an offshore activity, it hasn't been very intrusive in the Shetland islands,"" Governor Nigel Haywood told AFP. ""Norway could be another example."" They also are considering how millions of petrodollars might change their society, Haywood said. Some changes are already evident in Stanley. ""We all say that we are very sceptical about oil, but prices of housing in Stanley are going up already,"" said Sybie, owner of a Stanley gift shop that sells souvenirs to cruise ship passengers who arrive in the summers. Amid so many oil estimates and speculation -- not including the $30 million a year in revenue from fishing licenses that provide comfortable lifestyles on the islands -- the past has receded in the minds of many kelpers. Graham Didlick, owner of the Darwin House bed and breakfast and a tourist guide, said: ""People want to go on with their lives. We don't think of the war all the time, but we would prefer that things with Argentina were rather different."" Military cemeteries can be found at Darwin and San Carlos. Minefields and battle debris still are scattered among windy, isolated hills. Everyone questioned about the war remembers where they were at the time. Tomas Abraham, an Argentine philosopher visiting the islands this week, commented on the significance of the war today. ""Argentina has a stance that sounds anachronistic,"" he told AFP while walking through the Argentine cemetery in Darwin. ""The heroes of the Falklands are remembered because no one wants to remember that they have a bad conscience for having supported a dictatorship that led them to war and that those heroes died. ""I think the main thing now for Argentina is to concentrate on the geopolitics of the South Atlantic, on how to develop the resources there and even Antarctica, the biggest reservoir of fresh water in the world,"" he said. Abraham speculated that the next big conflict for Falkland Islanders would not be with Argentina, but with Britain. ""They'll have so much money that at some point they will go for independence, and they will have trouble with the UK over the cash,"" he said. Governor Haywood did not rule out the possibility of a bid for independence. ""England, in its history, has allowed the independence of territories under its control,"" he said. ""But I don't see any evidence of that in the near future at all."" tlb/trm/jkb"
THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS? SEX. SAUNAS AND SCENERY,Norway,"A new report lists all the Scandinavian countries as the world's most blissful. So what has made this once-morose corner of Europe smile? THERE is no better depiction of mental agony than the painting The Scream. Silently frozen in time the cartoonish figure clutches his head on either side as if his torment threatens to burst his skull. It's an image that has long struck a chord with depressives, schizophrenics and angst-ridden teenagers who think no one understands their pain. It's the work of Edvard Munch, history's second-most famous Norwegian. The most famous is Henrik Ibsen, whose gloomy plays were rivalled in misery only by those of his Swedish contemporary August Strindberg. And in the 20th century, Swedish director Ingmar Bergman was regarded as the world's most depressing film-maker. The current image of Scandinavia tends to be just as grim. From Sweden we have the Wallander novels, televised in a BBC series starring Kenneth Branagh, plus Stieg Larsson's megaselling Millennium trilogy. From Denmark we have had two series of The Killing, gory Saturday night viewing on BBC4. And from Norway we have the hard-bitten crime novels of Jo Nesbø, which are now beginning to hit our cinemas in film form. The unavoidable impression is that these are a people of unbounded misery who live most of the year in the dark and drug themselves against the pain with a diet of vodka and serial-killing. So it comes as a surprise to find that Scandinavians have been offi-cially designated the happiest people in the world by the United Nations. The first ever World Happiness Report, commissioned for this week's UN conference on happiness, found that the happiest countries on Earth are Denmark, Norway and Finland, with Sweden only slightly behind at number seven. Britain by contrast languishes at No18, while the least happy countries are Togo, Benin, the Central African Republic and Sierra Leone, all in sub-Saharan Africa. The truth may lie in the statistics not the crime fiction. Take Norway. While the rest of Europe is in debt our Nordic neighbour is sitting on a surplus. It has the world's fourth-highest gross domestic product per capita (wealth per head of population), behind only Qatar, Luxembourg and Singapore. In the UN's human development index, calculated from data on life expectancy and education as well as wealth, it leads the world. AND the key to this happy state of affairs is the North Sea oil discovered in 1969, which shows no sign of drying up. Modern Norway has an annual trade surplus of £37billion and a government pension fund worth almost £500billion - not bad for a country of five million people (about the same as Scotland) which won independence from Sweden only a century ago. ""We have a good work-life balance,"" says Hanne Knudsen of Visit Norway, the country's tourist board. ""We finish work earlier than in the UK, going home at three or four o'clock and then we have a lot of spare time when we go to see family and spend time outdoors . We have a word 'friluftsliv', which means 'outdoors living' - it defines everything Norwegians do. ""Of course a lot of the quality of life stems from the oil. It gives us a very good system for health and education - we don't have too much private schooling because most people go to state schools - and we reap the benefits from it. People still complain so it's not as if everyone is happy all of the time. But we are good at enjoying the outdoors, good weather and simple things."" And don't be surprised at the Scandinavians' liberal attitude to sex - there is universal sex education and it is not considered a taboo as in so many other countries. However Kåre Gade, a Danish journalist based in London, is sceptical about the report. ""I don't recognise the depressed, hard-drinking, suicidal, serial-killing people in the Scandi crime fiction but neither do I recognise the smug, happy-go-lucky people in the surveys,"" he says. His country has been identified as the world's least corrupt, with the highest level of press freedom, a high level of charitable giving and among the lowest number of prisoners per head of population in the world. It's also among the most equal, with one of the narrowest income gaps between the top and bottom 10 per cent. BUT he thinks social relations are the key to quality of life, noting his language also has a word that sums up the mentality: ""hygge"" or ""cosiness"". ""It's used as a verb as well as a noun so we like to say, 'I'm looking forward to cosy tonight', 'We're going to cosy together' and so on. Typically it will mean a get-together with family or friends. In the UK you don't tend to invite people home as much as we do. In Scandinavia you'd be suspected of being some sort of Norman Bates if you didn't invite guests to your house."" One of the stranger facts about Denmark is that its prime minister, the first woman to hold that office, is our own Neil Kinnock's daughter-inlaw, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Her appointment at the head of a complicated coalition was mirrored in another recent Danish drama Borgen, which included lashings of sex and glamour in the prime-ministerial bedroom. Over in Finland broadcast journalist Esa Koivio is surprised by the implication that his country is some kind of snow-covered Disneyland. ""Happiness is a state of mind and it's not the word I'd use about the country as a whole,"" he says. ""I think 'stable' is better than 'joyous'."" But he confirms one stereotype about his compatriots: they are completely addicted to saunas. ""More or less you can't have a new flat or a house built without one,"" he says. ""And it's the Finnish nation's contribution to the world of languages because 'sauna' is the Finnish word."" Back in London, Kåre Gade is sanguine about living in a country ranking only 18th in the happiness index. ""I feel quite comfortable and happy here,"" he says of life in Britain. But he adds with the cheerfulness of a man who hails from the world's happiest country even if he doesn't quite believe it: ""Then again I know I'm going back. I still have my passport."" THE EXPERT'S VIEW I WAS in Norway only last week so know just why it and the other Scandinavian countries are apparently so happy. Set foot on Norwegian soil and it strikes you immediately - a quasi-utopian feel that nags by way of comparison with impatient, broken Britain. Order, cleanliness, consideration and, yes, ubiquitous smiles. Eye contact comes readily, as does conversation, invariably with relaxed, worldly polyglots (education standards are lofty). One hesitates to generalise about physical characteristics, though I must admit that at least by my reckoning the national gene pool is in good shape. A reason to be cheerful if ever there was one. Like the country itself it's a natural, unforced beauty. From the vertiginous splendour of fjords to the dazzling ice fields of Svalbard, national pride is understandable. Prices are admittedly eye-watering although not for Norwegians whose salaries are concomitantly robust, fuelled by a booming oil and gas-buoyed economy that underpins the plumpest of welfare cushions. Life is to be enjoyed, not worried over. Employers appreciate this. Leisure time is sacrosanct, with the ""cabin culture"" widespread - every family has one, either coastal or in the mountains, imbuing the nation with a rosy-cheeked vitality. Holidaying at home is the norm, not a compromise. As one local put it: ""Why would we want to go anywhere else?"" DUNCAN CRAIG DEPUTY TRAVEL EDITOR"
Harry's haunts.,Norway,"CITY BREAK: OSLO:FORGET TRADITIONAL CITY breaks. The latest way to work a metropolis is to explore its underbelly with a crime thriller tour – a new genre of walking tour in which the city plays a principal role in the story. It’s a perspective that lets you see the sights and the lesser known bedrock of a city. Scandinavia in particular is profiting from the popularity of crime novels set there. In Stockholm, you can take the Stieg Larsson Millennium tour. In Copenhagen, the tourist board is making a killing from tours it hosts hooked on the success of TV drama The Killing. Oslo recently cashed in its crime chips with a Harry Hole tour, which ran during the winter season. In a city that ranks fifth most expensive in the world, savvy weekenders are now doing a DIY version, following for free in the footsteps of the country’s most celebrated detective. Detective Harry Hole of the Oslo Crime Squad is a character created by musician-turned-author Jo Nesbø. After the success of the Millennium trilogy, Nesbø is the latest Scandi author to become hot in Hollywood. Martin Scorsese recently signed up to direct the film version of Nesbø’s book The Snowman featuring the much-loved Hole. Headhunters, a film based on another Nesbo book, but not featuring Harry Hole, opened in cinemas here yesterday. In tourism terms, crime certainly pays. It is the fictitious Harry Hole that is Oslo’s latest attraction. To see the city through his eyes, start by ascending to the 21st floor of the Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel. From the Summit Bar you can see where Hole lives at Sofie’s Gate, as well as some of the locations in his novels. From the top, the yellow painted Royal Palace is visible as is the island-littered Oslo Fjord, which both feature in The Redbreast storyline, in which Hole must find the owner of a rare Marlin rifle. That book’s plot oscillates between old and neo-Nazi storylines – themes that resonate with contemporary Norway as the trial of far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik, responsible for the Oslo bombing and the shooting dead of 69 people on the Island of Utoya last July, starts on April 16th. Ask politely, and you may also be able to visit Oslo Courthouse, where Brevik’s trial will open. The courthouse plays a minor role in several Hole books. Inside, extracts from the Norwegian Magna Carta face an internal column, and if you are allowed, take the lift to the top, where the views are stunning. The second floor is being remodelled to accommodate the numbers expected for the forthcoming trial. Nearby is the still-boarded-up site of the Oslo bombings where eight people were killed last July. Newspaper headlines from that day hang behind glass as a memorial. Adjacent to it is Oslo’s Supreme Court building, where Brevik’s case will most likely end up. A five-minute walk from here will take you to Sehesteds Plass, home to Aschehoug Publishing House, where Jo Nesbø sent his first manuscript, The Bat, under a pseudonym. Aschehoug also published Salman Rushdie’s Satanic Verses. Across the square is another publishing house, Gyldendalhuset, whose sister publishing arm in Copenhagen first put Ibsen in print. Egertorget Square is a few minutes’ walk away and home to a historical neon Freia chocolate sign and clock. This “small piece of Norway”, as the brand’s tag line goes, is referenced in Roald Dahl’s Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. Dahl was born in Britain, of Norwegian stock. Freia is also said to have sustained Roald Amundsen and his South Pole team. In Norway, there is a cross-country skiing tradition of taking chocolate and oranges with you for sustenance. But for Hole fans, this is where a Croatian hit-man kills a Salvation Army officer in The Redeemer, Hole’s fourth book translated into English. Somewhat off the beaten track is Hole’s favourite hang-out, the old-fashioned Restaurant Schrøder, a dimly-lit, burgundy-walled eatery that has no interest in jumping on to the Harry Hole tourist phenomenon. Paintings from the 1920s hang on the wall, as does a sign warning diners that they’re not allowed to use laptops, play chess or cards. Apparently they sell less beer if you engage in such activities. There is no photography allowed. This restaurant was originally located in the city centre and while under occupation, it was a meeting place for Nazis. This bastion of old Norway cuisine is now being run by a Pakistani immigrant – a sign of the times. The rising number of immigrants into Norway is a fact of life and an ongoing storyline in Nesbø’s books and in many other Scandinavian thrillers. Hole lives nearby, at number five or number eight Sofie’s Gate – depending on which book you’re reading. Confusingly, he has two addresses at number five. The one at Dovregata, around the corner from Sofie’s Gate, is actually the correct address. On the day this writer called, there was no one home. Oslo’s Sculpture Park is a dramatic setting and offers another vantage point from which to drink in the city’s views. It contains 192 full-size sculptures by artist Gustav Vigeland, who designed the Nobel Peace Prize medal, as well the architectural setting and the layout of the grounds. Frognerbadet is a stylish lido set in the middle of the park. The complex has three heated outdoor pools, water slides, a diving tower and children’s pools. The bath’s diving boards makes a gruesome appearance in The Leopard. Not surprisingly, several graveyards feature in the Harry Hole series. Vestre gravlund (Western cemetery) appears in The Phantom, which has just been published in English. Number 15 Ullevalsveien is where the opening scene of the The Devil’s Star takes place. It overlooks Vår Frelsers gravlund (Our Saviour’s Graveyard) the final resting place of playwright, theatre director and poet Henrik Ibsen, writer and Nobel laureate, Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Symbolist painter and printmaker Edvard Munch. On the outskirts of the city is Holmenkollen, a hill on the edge of a forest that is a starting point for summer and winter hikes. It is also home to Oslo’s top tourist attraction, the aluminium-clad cantilevered Holmenkollen Ski Museum and Ski Jump Tower. The new jump was opened in 2010. Inside its steel and concrete exterior is the Ski Museum. It tracks the sport’s 4,000-year history, as well as the Polar expeditions of Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen and Winter Olympics memorabilia. The location features in The Snowman. Landmarks such as the opera house, completed in 2008, should also be visited. Situated on the Bjørvika peninsula, overlooking Oslo Fjord, it is home to the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet. It has a marble roof that forms a large public space where Oslo natives like to bask in the sun. From it, you can see Akershus Fortress, which dates from the 13th century. At the Grand Hotel Café on Karl Johan’s Gate, you can pay your respects to Ibsen, who came here daily to sip his specially imported German beer. A selection of his best-known works are embedded into the pavement opposite and lead, like literary breadcrumbs, to the writer’s apartment, which is open to the public. Detective Harry Hole may have put Oslo back on the tourist map, but no visit to the city is complete with a trawl through past highlights. This includes the national gallery and the Munch Museum, both scenes of Munch art heists, and compelling in the context of Headhunters, the Nesbø movie now on release. It mirrors the real-life thefts with a fictitious contemporary art heist of its own. When Munch died in 1944, among the works he left to the city of Oslo were not one, but two oil paintings of The Scream. They differ slightly; the national gallery’s version is nicotine-hued in tone. The version in the Munch Museum is brighter and more lurid in colour. Both are worth viewing. See innovationnorway.noand visitnorway.nofor more information on visiting the city Oslo Where to . . .

DJ The Arctic Likely To Attract $100B Investments In Coming Decade-Report,Norway,"STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--The Arctic region is likely to attract investment of $100 billion or more over the coming decade, according to a report by independent policy institute Chatham House and the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Interest in the Arctic region has intensified in recent years as a boom in commodities has seen companies scramble for precious resources to satisfy growing demand from China, among others. A melting ice cap hasn't only opened up new shipping routes that significantly cut transport times and distances between Europe and Asia, it has also made the region's estimated rich deposits of oil, gas and minerals more accessible. The report, published Thursday, notes that oil and gas, mining and the shipping industries will be the biggest drivers and beneficiaries of Arctic economic development in the coming years, but it says the Arctic's economic future depends principally on local investment conditions and global commodity prices. ""One thing that stands out most clearly from this report is the significant level of uncertainty about the Arctic's future, both environmentally and economically,"" said Richard Ward, chief executive of Lloyd's. ""Some of the technologies that will help to shape that future, such as those involved in deepwater drilling and ice management are already tried, while others are still in their infancy or yet to be developed."" Growing interest in four key sectors--mineral resources, fisheries, logistics and Arctic tourism--could, according to the report, generate substantial investment in the region over the next decade, especially in the minerals sector. The region is estimated to hold extensive hydrocarbon reserves adding to its allure despite harsh climate and environmental concerns. The region--which spans Alaska, Russia, Norway and Greenland--may contain as much as 30% of the world's undiscovered gas and 13% of the world's undiscovered crude oil, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But most of the oil is believed to lie deep underwater, on continental shelves, which makes the exploration and production process prohibitively expensive and technically challenging for all but the largest firms. A two-year exploration campaign--at a cost of $1.2 billion--by Cairn Energy PLC (CNE.LN) offshore Greenland failed to yield a commercial discovery. The report adds that a large part of the investments are likely to be in the Barents Sea area, north of Norway and Russia, and in northern Alaska, but smaller investments with major local and international consequences, could occur in Greenland, Canada and elsewhere in the Arctic. The speed of Arctic economic development is, however, heavily dependant on global supply and demand dynamics and ""falling commodity prices would probably put many Arctic projects on hold,"" the report said. Environmental groups have also raised concerns that any kind of spill from drilling activity in the region risks spoiling one of the planet's most fragile ecosystems. Greenpeace has warned that recent deepwater incidents, including BP PLC's (BP.LN) Deepwater Horizon disaster that led to millions of barrels of crude spewing into the Gulf of Mexico, provide a stark reminder of the dangers of deepwater exploration, a risk that would only be heightened in the harsh and difficult to access Arctic. -By Christina Zander and Alexis Flynn, Dow Jones Newswires; +46 8 545 131 04; christina.zander@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires April 11, 2012 20:01 ET (00:01 GMT)"
Damage control; Green charities rewrite grant descriptions in wake of budget,Norway,"One of the big American charitable funders of environmental campaigns in Canada and the U.S., the Oak Foundation, has rewritten the publicly stated purpose of several grants to Canadian environmental groups. Three days after Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's March 29 budget announced a review of political activity by charities in Canada, Oak said in a website posting that it had ""modified and added additional content to some grants to reflect progress, lessons learned and achievements."" But the changes mostly remove aspects of grant descriptions that might draw criticism and regulatory attention. Oak didn't say which grants it recently modified. However, a comparison of Oak's grants before and after the federal budget shows that Oak rewrote grants for oil sandsrelated campaigns to Tides Canada, ForestEthics, Greenpeace, and the West Coast Environmental Law Research Foundation. The value of the rewritten grants, awarded within the last two years, is more than $1-million. Oak has offices in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Europe. The foundation says that it was created by Alan Parker, one of the co-founders of Duty Free Stores. In 2011, Oak granted $158-million to 312 organizations in 41 countries. Oak is one of the foundations that supports a U.S. strategy called ""Design to Win,"" in which voter and consumer campaigns are funded as a way to shift investment capital toward solar and wind energy and away from fossil fuels. This isn't the first time a U.S. charitable foundation has quietly tweaked multiple grants for a million-dollar campaign. Several years ago, the San Francisco-based Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation rewrote descriptions of four grants worth $3.6million for a marketing campaign against farmed salmon. One $560,000 grant originally stated that the expected outcomes were ""identification of anti-farming audience and issues, integration of aquaculture science messages into anti-farming campaign, standardization of anti-farming messaging tool-kit, creation of an earned-media campaign, and co-ordination of media for antifarming ENGOs."" All that was deleted in the rewrite. Since 2003, Moore has granted a total of $93-million to organizations in BC. Of that, $30-million went to Tides Canada. In all, at least 15 American foundations and environmental groups have rewritten or removed online information since I began tracking the U.S. funding of Canadian environmental campaigns. The Oak Foundation's recent rewrites are notable because of the timing - three days after Ottawa's federal budget announcement - and because the changes significantly alter the stated objectives of the grants. For example, Oak rewrote its description of a grant for $97,131 to the West Coast Environmental Law Research Foundation. The rewritten grant omits a sentence which said, ""The desired result [of the grant to West Coast Law] would be a permanent legislative tanker ban and cancellation of the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline."" Oak also rewrote a $299,879 grant to ForestEthics. The project started in August of 2010 - more than a year earlier - so it seems a bit late to be rewriting the grant. ForestEthics is not and has never been a federally registered charity in Canada. Instead, until earlier this year, ForestEthics Canada was part of Tides Canada, the sister organization of the U.S. Tides Foundation. U.S. tax returns show that in 2009 alone, Tides Canada paid $783,603 to ForestEthics Canada ""for capacity building support."" Originally, Oak's grant to ForestEthics was for ""creating a perception of economic risk, whereby tar sands imports become less attractive to U.S. corporations and, the Canadian government questions its unbridled support for expanded and unregulated development."" The rewritten, toned-down version says that ForestEthics is funded for ""creating awareness"" of economic risks rather than ""creating perception."" The part about getting the Canadian government to question the Alberta oil industry is gone. Oak's original grant description also said that ForestEthics was funded to get at least one Fortune 500 company ""to exert influence within the U.S. government to support regulations that will disadvantage Tar Sands fuel."" Those words have been removed. Oak also rewrote a 2011 grant of $200,000 to Tides Canada to develop ""A New Energy Future for Canada."" The original grant said that Tides Canada, which has charitable status in Canada, was funded ""to develop a plan and a pathway to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050."" Oak also funded Tides Canada ""to develop a compelling narrative and use it to sustain critical pressure and focus public attention,"" but those details are now gone. Oak also rewrote details of a grant for $424,373 to Greenpeace for a campaign called ""Stop the Tar Sands,"" a project that has been underway for more than a year. The original grant said that Greenpeace was funded to get Norway's Statoil and BP to discontinue investing in the Canadian oil sands. In the rewritten grant, references to Statoil and BP are gone. Oak's original grant also said that Greenpeace was funded ""to convince a total of 10 Alberta municipalities to support legislation for an Alberta-wide feed-in tariff."" In the re written version, there's no mention of convincing 10 Alberta municipalities. Oak's original grant said that Greenpeace was funded ""to create enough financial, regulatory and political uncertainty that prominent financial analysts will publicly state their concern about investments in the tar sands."" The rewritten version says that Greenpeace will ""create awareness"" of uncertainty in investments in the tar sands. Again, creating awareness and creating uncertainty are not the same; creating uncertainty hardly seems like a typical charitable activity. Other U.S. foundations that have removed or modified online information about environmental campaigns to thwart the Canadian oil industry are the Bullitt Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Inc. The Seattle-based Bullitt Foundation rewrote its description of a grant to the Dogwood Initiative, which calls itself ""a team of 10 super-talented people, based in Victoria, BC."" Dogwood says that it ""works with people in key communities throughout the province and the rest of the country."" Dogwood doesn't have charitable status. Bullitt's original grant was $30,000 paid to the U.S. Tides Foundation for Dogwood ""to mobilize urban voters for a federal ban on coastal tankers."" The problem here is that American charitable foundations aren't allowed to mobilize voters in a foreign country. The rewritten grant says that the money was ""to engage and educate citizens."" That rewrite came in December of 2010, days after I testified to a House of Commons committee about U.S.-funded campaigns that would thwart Canadian oil exports to Asia. The Dogwood Initiative redesigned its website earlier this year. In doing so, Dogwood eliminated the Web page that listed its partners and supporters. Internet archives show that over the years, Dogwood has reported that at least seven U.S. foundations have supported Dogwood. These include the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Wilburforce Foundation, the Brainerd Foundation, the Bullitt Foundation and the U.S. Tides Foundation. Within days of my Post op-ed, ""Who is organizing for change?,"" in February 2011, the Seattle-based Wilburforce Foundation stripped its website of all details for all grants. Wilburforce recently added a searchable database to its website, but beyond the title of the grant, the database no longer includes any details of the nature of the project. Wilburforce was created by Gordon Letwin, one of the founders of Microsoft. Since 2000, Wilburforce has granted at least $24-million for environmental initiatives in B.C. Until the spring of 2010, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund Inc. (RBF) reported at its website that it granted $50,000 to Tides Canada to develop a website about ""Oil Sands Tourism."" RBF Inc. has confirmed by email that the website that Tides Canada developed with RBF funds is found at www. travelingalberta.com. This website makes a mockery of Alberta tourism. Originally, RBF reported that its grant to Tides Canada was ""to increase pressure on Alberta policymakers.... "" After I started asking questions about RBF's grants, RBF, like Wilburforce, removed a substantial portion of the detailed descriptions of its grants. Its website no longer says that RBF funded Tides Canada to pressure the Alberta government. Several Canadian organizations have also removed revealing online information. Days after I began asking Open Media about its funding, Open Media removed a Web page that said it received donations through Tides Canada. Open Media also removed an online comment about having mobilized 400,000 people to oppose a CRTC ruling. That comment was, ""You've been part of the biggest online campaign in Canadian history! And you've moved politics!"" A year later, OpenMedia.ca now says at its website that it has a donor-advised fund at Tides Canada. By its own admission, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has been using Tides Canada as a vehicle through which to receive charitable donations because PETA itself doesn't qualify. ""Head up, Canadians!"" PETA wrote online, adding, ""For your retirement account, and donations and bequests to PETA in general, you may want to consider giving through the Tides Canada Foundation-PETA Fund. Tides Canada is a registered charity, but PETA is not because of our advocacy work.... If Canadian tax credits are important, you can only get those benefits by making the beneficiary of your retirement accounts the Tides Canada-PETA Fund rather than specifying PETA."" Internet archives show that shortly after Tides Canada was asked by email about PETA's comments, PETA removed this paragraph. Living Oceans Society (LOS), based in Sointula, B.C., seems to have found another way of skirting Canadian rules on political activity. In a report contained in the 2001 tax return of the Bullitt foundation, LOS writes, ""Living Oceans Society is currently applying for charitable tax status. We have been advised to refrain from posting action items on our Web page until this application has been approved as it could be interpreted as 'political.' In the meantime, we have met with a Web page designer and we are prepared to add this to our Web page when the timing is more appropriate."" A spokesperson for the Canada Revenue Agency said by telephone that LOS began the process of becoming a federally registered charity, but didn't complete it. Nevertheless, since 2000 LOS has been paid at least $10million by U.S. foundations, U.S. tax returns show. LOS says at its website that it has a funding arrangement with Tides Canada. The reasons behind the rewriting of grant descriptions may be many. For the most part, though, they appear to eliminate references to possibly inappropriate political activities for which Canadian environmental organizations were explicitly funded - the only type of political activity that charities are allowed to engage in are those that further a charitable purpose. When numerous foundations systematically rewrite multiple grants for what appear to be million-dollar politically active campaigns, Canadian and U.S. government officials should investigate. Vivian Krause is a Vancouver researcher and writer. Her blog is www.fair-questions.com[http://www.fair-questions.com]. On Twitter, she's @FairQuestions. NOTA BENE WHAT'S POLITICAL From the Canada Revenue Agency's Policy Statement on Charities and Prohibited Political Activities, 2003: We presume an activity to be political if a charity: 1. explicitly communicates a call to political action (i.e., encourages the public to contact an elected representative or public official and urges them to retain, oppose, or change the law, policy, or decision of any level of government in Canada or a foreign country); 2. explicitly communicates to the public that the law, policy, or decision of any level of government in Canada or a foreign country should be retained (if the retention of the law, policy or decision is being reconsidered by a government), opposed, or changed; or 3. explicitly indicates in its materials (whether internal or external) that the intention of the activity is to incite, or organize to put pressure on, an elected representative or public official to retain, oppose, or change the law, policy, or decision of any level of government in Canada or a foreign country."
Clinton Talks Cooperation in Resource-Rich Arctic,Norway,"TROMSO, Norway (AP)—U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is trekking north of the Arctic Circle, a region that could become a new international battleground for resources. Ms. Clinton's trip Saturday to the northern Norwegian city of Tromso is her second to the area in a year. She is bringing a message of cooperation to one of the world's last frontiers of unexplored oil, gas and mineral deposits and underscoring the region's rising significance as melting icecaps accelerate the opening of new shipping routes, fishing stocks and drilling opportunities. To safely exploit the riches, the U.S. and other countries near the North Pole are trying to work together to combat harmful climate change, settling territorial disputes and preventing oil spills. ""From a strategic standpoint, the Arctic has an increasing geopolitical importance as countries vie to protect their rights and extend their influence,"" Ms. Clinton said Friday in the Norwegian capital of Oslo. Governments should ""agree on what would be, in effect, the rules of the road in the Arctic, so new developments are economically sustainable and environmentally responsible toward future generations."" At the least, the U.S. and the other Arctic nations hope to avoid a confrontational race for resources. Officials say the picture looks more promising than five years ago when Russia staked its claim to supremacy in the Arctic and its $9 trillion in estimated oil reserves by planting a titanium flag on the ocean floor. The U.S. does not recognize the Russian assertion and has its own claims, along with Denmark, Norway and Canada, while companies from Exxon Mobil Corp. to Royal Dutch Shell PLC want to get in on the action. China also is keeping a close eye on the region. Moscow has eased tensions somewhat by promising to press any claims through an agreed United Nations process. But Washington, for its part, has yet to ratify the global body's 1982 Law of the Sea treaty regulating the ocean's use for military, transportation and mineral extraction purposes. One hundred sixty countries have acceded to the pact and the Obama administration is making a new push for Senate approval. Refusing to sign on means the U.S. could be frozen out of its share of the spoils. Arguing for its ratification at a Senate hearing last week, Ms. Clinton said the treaty would offer the U.S. oil and gas rights some 600 miles into the Arctic. ""American companies are equipped and ready to engage in deep seabed mining,"" she said. ""But the United States can only take advantage of the...mine sites in areas beyond national jurisdiction as a party to this treaty."" The Arctic's warming is occurring at least twice as fast as anywhere else on earth, threatening to raise sea levels by up to five feet this century and possibly causing a 25% jump in mercury emissions over the next decade. The changes could threaten polar bears, whales, seals and indigenous communities hunting those animals for food, not to mention islands and low-lying areas much farther afield, from Florida to Bangladesh. But the rapidly changing climate is also changing the realm of what is possible from transportation to tourism, with the summer ice melting away by more than 17,000 square miles each year. During the most temperate days last year, only a fifth of the Arctic Circle was ice-covered. Little of the ice has been frozen longer than two years, which is harder for icebreakers to cut through. Europeans see new shipping routes to China that, at least in the warmth and sunlight of summer, are 40% faster than traveling through the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. A northwest passage between Greenland and Canada could significantly speed cargo traveling between the Dutch shipping hub of Rotterdam and ports in California. And the eight-nation Arctic Council, which is being established in Tromso, is hoping to manage the new opportunities in a responsible way. Talking to reporters Friday, Ms. Clinton urged the governments to ""begin working together to make plans for what will most certainly become greater ocean travel, greater exploration, therefore greater pollution, greater impact of human beings."" ""We will of course claim what is ours under international law,"" she said. ""But we know that leaves a great vast amount of the Arctic that will be a common responsibility."" Last year in Greenland, Ms. Clinton and her counterparts from other nations took a small step toward international cooperation by agreeing to coordinate Arctic search-and-rescue missions for stranded sailors and others. Officials are now trying to enhance the cooperation, including through joint plans to prevent oil spills in an environment that would make cleanup a logistical nightmare. And the U.S. has also been championing measures such as shifting away from dirty diesel engines, agricultural burning and hydrofluorocarbons to lessen the effect of short-lived greenhouse gases that are a particularly potent source of climate change in the Arctic.

"Spitsbergen: Remote, wild, and on the edge",Norway,"Travel | NORWAY This northern outpost is a land of polar bears, clean air and epic scenery. Mark Rowe experiences one of the world's last great wildernesses Perhaps it's because of all the Nobel prizes they dish out, or because they have utilised their reserves of North Sea oil so much more judiciously than the UK, but I trust Norwegians. That's why when Martin, once a soldier, now a wildlife guide who passes the dark winter months on Svalbard reading books, invited me to walk on thin ice, I did so with all the trust of a horse being led by its owner to the knacker's yard. The ice had a slushy crust - enough to wash over my boots - and you could see the water below, separated by what Martin reckoned was seven inches of ice. Fortunately, there were plenty of distractions, not least the staggering scenery of Trygghamna, or ""safe harbour"", an inlet in the mighty Isfjord, which sweeps for more than 100 miles from the Arctic Ocean into the heart of Spitsbergen, the largest island on the Svalbard archipelago. The basic rule for walking on ice is apparently to shuffle along in single file, in the footprints of the person ahead. Backmarkers risk slipping unnoticed into the water. We are watched by a bearded seal and a ringed seal, and then, of course, there are polar bears. Even before last year's fatal attack on a British student, local guides went to great lengths to stress the danger they present. I've been on wildlife trips where guides clearly exaggerate the dangers, to create an artificial frisson. That's not the Norwegian style. Martin carried a gun, as anyone walking on Svalbard must, but shooting a bear is a last resort and we would, he calmly instructed us, first clap our hands in an attempt to scare them off. The inquiry into last year's attack identified ""a number of unfortunate circumstances"" but cleared those who laid the tripwire flares and shot the bear of any criminal negligence. The family of the teenager are appealing the ruling. The reality, says the local tourist board, is that just 3 per cent of visitors to Spitsbergen will see a polar bear, at any distance. But bear attacks have even happened in the regional capital, Longyearbyen, albeit rarely, according to local guides. Everyone I met stressed that by observing basic safety and procedures you significantly mitigate those risks. We never did see a bear, apart from skinned or stuffed ones splayed and mounted across the walls of hotels and airport arrival halls. But free-range walking requires that you can use a rifle, and have the expertise to set up trip wires and flares when you camp. I opted, instead, for a series of walks based around Cape Linne, on the western edge of Spitsbergen, made possible by the 24-hour sunlight in high summer. €The venue was Basecamp Isfjord Radio. Having expected to subsist on berries and processed reindeer meat for four days, I was surprised - but not overly disappointed - to find that Isfjord Radio, once a meteorology, communications and Cold War spying outpost, had been converted into a boutique hotel. The giant satellite dish remains, as do redundant telegraph wires and poles that punctuate the landscape and march away to the skyline. These and other incongruous features are in full view as you recline with a glass of chilled wine in surroundings of sea-spray shades of white and blue. One of Norway's top chefs has been tempted away from Oslo, and the reindeer mousse and brunost - caramelised goat's cheese - were real highlights. We were not allowed to leave our base, or even wander around the compound, without badgering staff to accompany us. And, although the Arctic has an extraordinary capacity to thrill and overwhelm, should you want to sit down and get all poetic about it you have to do so with a marksman waiting discreetly a few yards off. Every day the bar for sightseeing was raised by encounters with creatures of the Arctic imagination. Eider ducks, whose startled cooing sounds disconcertingly like Frankie Howerd from beyond the grave, nested all around. Arctic skuas whiled away the day with aerial dogfights in which competing males spectacularly bashed their breasts against one another. Then there's the Svalbard reindeer, more stumpy and wind-pummelled than their mainland cousins, fetchingly doe-eyed in panda fashion, who graze around the equally unlikely summertime flowers of moss campion and pink saxifrage. One morning, two walruses barrelled about in the shallow waters offshore. These huge animals managed to look positively balletic. The icing on the frozen gateaux was the spectacle of neither one nor two but three blue whales at least a mile out to sea. They spouted showers of air from their blowholes and then, obligingly, performed an about-turn and shunted back along our line of vision. One walk of three miles took us below the Alkhornet, an Eiger-like, triangular rock-face home to nesting kittiwakes. These little gulls filled the air like confetti. Underneath the rock-face our group slowly stopped, possibly just halted by the glory of the spectacle around us. Pointy, icy peaks flanked the north coast of the fjord, seven miles wide at this point, while more glacier-flattened mountains book-ended the view across the bay. The clarity of the air made distances and heights hard to judge: those mountains looked to be 10,000ft high; I checked the map later and they generally came in at around 3,000ft. Perhaps I was just taken aback by where I was. Barely three hours' flight from Oslo, it felt like I was standing on a spinning top. The southern shores of Spitsbergen are where the Gulf Stream gasps its last, and neighbouring places at this latitude - 78N - have epic names such as Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya. By comparison, Prudhoe Bay at the northern end of Canada's epic Dalton Highway, is a mere 70N. Even Greenland's mysterious settlement of Thule - the ancient Greeks' embodiment of the edge of the Earth - lies further south. The North Pole is a mere 800 miles away, in global terms just around the corner. Anything you do up here - send a postcard, order a beer, answer a call of nature - comes with the inevitable tagline of being ""the world's most northerly ..."" You can also manufacture other ways to get the adrenalin going. One evening, someone came up with the idea of a pre-breakfast swim in the Arctic Ocean. A little too much wine having being drunk, we all signed up. I recalled reading how sailors often survived in icy waters only to die when hauled out as the shock of warming up hit them. ""OK, then it'll be a case of euphoria or death,"" one of our party helpfully pointed out. In the event, it was no colder than the North Sea off South Shields in February, and, of course, we were watched from the shore by a member of the hotel team, in this case the cook, with her gun slung over her shoulder. Weather forecasts make for truly surreal reading. On our arrival, the forecast was for bright sun, light winds and 5C between midnight and 6am. It was the same all day round. There was no reason why temperatures should drop at night, for the simple reason that there wasn't any night. For a few days it was exhilarating, but I suspected that you might tire of it. Svalbard effectively has two tourist seasons: summer, when the sun never sets, and winter, when it never rises. It is easy to look at Svalbard as unchanging, but Arctic ice, typically about 10ft thick, has thinned by more than 2ft in the past four winters, according to Nasa. The plight of polar bears as this ice contracts beneath them is well documented. Predictions of just when the Arctic will become ice-free in the summer have hastily been revised from the end of this century to within a decade, according to Professor Peter Wadhams of the Polar Oceans Physics Group at Cambridge University. A visit to the Svalbard museum in Longyearbyen shows how this elemental landscape still has traces of a dark passage in its history. Some whale and seal populations are only now recovering after the great slaughter that extended over three centuries as Europeans sought out blubber. Norway gained ownership of Svalbard in 1925, but just before that the Svalbard Treaty was ratified, enabling anyone to declare an interest in the islands' resources. The bizarre list of signatories includes Venezuela and Afghanistan and, in reality, everyone is biding their time. Svalbard is reckoned to be oozing oil, along with deposits of gas, coal, even gold. Given that Svalbard today is a remorselessly treeless, Arctic desert, this is ironic; the explanation is that the primordial Svalbard lay somewhere close to the equator and was covered by forest that later decayed to form today's tempting mineral wealth. Mining goes on in a desultory, piecemeal fashion today. Russia even has a concession to mine at Barentsburg, a Soviet-era town of pastel colours. But it will take great resolve for Norway to keep the door shut as world reserves dwindle. The advice for dealing with polar bears is no use in these circumstances. If you clap loudly, the miners are not going to go away. That said, trusting Norwegians as I do, if anyone can keep Svalbard pristine, they can. TRAVEL ESSENTIALS GETTING THERE Mark Rowe visited Spitsbergen with Basecamp Explorer (00 47 79 02 46 00; basecampexplorer.com), which offers four-night trips, including two-days of excursions and full-board at Isfjord Radio, from £1,200, based on two people sharing.

Passenger numbers soar at HIAL airports,Norway,"New international links, increased tourism and industrial activity are behind increasing passenger numbers using airports operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL). Last month’s figures were 7.8% up on May of last year. The publicly owned HIAL is now set to build on the 1.17 million passengers using its airports last year and the 1.1 million in 2010. It may not match the 9.4 million, which accounted for Edinburgh Airport’s £807m sale price earlier this month, but HIAL is pleased. It says its traffic has been boosted by a growing demand for international flights to and from the Highlands and Islands. In May a total of 114,366 passengers passed through HIAL’s 11 airports, which stretch from Shetland in the north to Campbeltown and Islay in the south. The busiest airport in the group, Inverness, reported an 8.4% rise in passenger numbers, with 55,519 passengers through the terminal last month. According to the company, numbers were boosted by the continuing success of Flybe’s Amsterdam service from the Highland capital and EasyJet’s additional Gatwick flights. The latter also flies to Luton. Seasonal flights to Dusseldorf by Lufthansa and Zurich by Helvetic also took off last month and are expected to boost inter-national traffic through the summer. Meanwhile, a new code share agreement between Flybe and KLM announced last month means Inverness passengers can fly to about 150 worldwide destinations via Amsterdam. At Sumburgh in the Shetlands, passenger numbers rose by 17.9%, boosted by increasing oil sector traffic, the launch of seasonal flights to Bergen in Norway, and strong growth on the Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow routes. Passenger numbers were also up at Kirkwall, with growth on the Aberdeen and Edinburgh routes resulting in a 3.5% increase. At Wick, additional oil sector movements generated a 9% rise in numbers, with Eastern Airways flying to Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The ongoing schools construction project at Stornoway increased passengers by 3.3%. Loganair, in a franchise agreement with Flybe, flies to Benbecula, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness, as well as most other HIAL routes. Eastern also offers an Aberdeen service from Stornoway. On Islay, the success of this year’s whisky festival fuelled a passenger increase of 13.4%. At Campbeltown, golf-related charters since the opening of the Machrihanish Dunes course in 2009 and growth on the Glasgow route, increased passenger numbers by 41.8%. Additional scheduled flights increased passenger numbers at Barra by 19.4%. On the downside, at Dundee, passenger numbers fell by 11.3% due to reduced capacity on CityJet’s London City route, and a reduction in passengers on Flybe’s Belfast and Birmingham routes. The reduction at Dundee was offset slightly by the earlier start this year of the Ramsay World Travel’s Jersey charter route. At Benbecula, passenger numbers were down marginally, by 0.6%. Inglis Lyon, managing director for HIAL, said: “The continuing success of our international services at Sumburgh and Inverness is good news for local business and leisure passengers. “The launch last month of a new code share agreement between Flybe and KLM means the Highland passengers now enjoy seamless global connections. “A growing international network is also good news for the regional economy, creating new opportunities for businesses and tourism providers across our network. “The domestic market is also continuing to perform strongly, with growing demand for flights to Scotland’s main cities and London Gatwick, which has become an increasingly attractive alternative to congested Heathrow.”"

"Rich, happy and in control: Norway flies the flag for a life outside the EU; Norwegians believe they get the best from Brussels without the burden, writes Harriet Alexander",Norway,"ON THE historic quayside, gazing out over the North Sea, the sunburnt young man took a swig of his lager and paused. ""We want to be our own masters,"" he said finally, ""and not let Brussels tell us what to do. Why should we be in the European Union and pay for the mistakes of other countries?"" With a shrug of his shoulders, he added the oft-heard British refrain: ""We're better out of the EU."" But this was not a British shore, and the familiar phrases were not coming from British lips. In Bergen, Norway's second city, such views are almost universally held, and Hans-Erik Almas, 23, is among the 80 per cent of Norwegians who think their country is right not to be in the EU. ""Norway is strong and wealthy, so I don't see why we should put that at risk by joining,"" he said. ""We already have the best parts of the EU without actually being a member."" It's an opinion increasingly shared across the sea, in Britain. Last week, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, David Cameron raised the possibility of a referendum on Britain's membership. And Norway is often cited as a perfect example of how to leave the EU, yet still thrive. ""People worry that if Britain left we would lose access to the Single Market and not be able to travel freely,"" said Robert Oulds, the director of the Bruges Group think tank. ""But the only thing we will lose is the bureaucracy and expense."" Norway's five million people were twice asked whether they wanted to join — with referendums in 1972 and 1994 — and each time, after impassioned debate, narrowly voted 'no'. Instead Norway, along with Iceland and Liechtenstein, joined the European Economic Area (EEA) — an association of all 27 EU member states, plus the three non-EU members, which are all governed by the ""Four Freedoms"": the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital. Norway is subject to just one third of the regulation of full EU members, although the EEA has no say over agriculture, fishing or justice and home affairs. For Norway the arrangement appears to be working well. It is one of the richest and most contented nations on Earth, with a GDP per capita of £40,000 — compared to £23,000 in the UK, and an EU average of £21,150. Unemployment is at 3.25 per cent, while GDP is growing at 2.75 per cent per year — as it has for 40 years, on average. It also regularly tops the UN's quality of life survey, with a generous welfare system — women receive 46 weeks of maternity leave at full salary, compared with Britain's six weeks on 90 per cent — and education is free. The country funds this through its huge reserves of oil, timber and fish which it manages prudently, stashing away oil revenues to fund the future health care needs of an ageing population. ""In Norway, we think that we are the best judges of our country's own interests,"" said Ola Hedsten, the chairman of a farming co-operative with 55,000 members. Norway does not subscribe to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), so can manage its land as it wishes. But food products sold to the EU must still meet Single Market regulations, and face an import tariff as well. ""The emphasis is on supporting small farmers to produce enough food for us to eat here,"" said Mr Hedsten. ""The CAP is all about mass production, but we don't want that."" Bergen has been a merchant city since Viking times, capitalising on its waters and forested hillsides to become a key part of the Hanseatic League — a trading organisation that linked ports of northern Europe from the 1300s to the 1660s. And that trading spirit prevails. With a population of 260,000, the city is home to many big oil firms plus the world's largest salmon farming company. On the granite pavement by the quayside, giant slabs of salmon are sold alongside scampi, whale meat and crabs. Reindeer sausages and elkskin rugs are hawked as well as woollen jumpers and statuettes of trolls. But for all the Norwegian tradition, the market has a modern flavour. ""I left Malaga because there was no work in the tourism sector there,"" said Ines Castro, 27. She earns €17 (£14) an hour, a fortune compared with wages in Spain. ""There is no way Norway should join the EU,"" said Gabriel Remotti, 25, from Rome. ""At home it's a disaster. Here there are real opportunities."" Yet not everyone agrees that the Norwegian model is a good thing. Torben Foss, a former civil servant who was in charge of writing the fishing chapter of the EEA, believes it would be better if Norway joined the EU. ""There is a fear that if we did so the EU will suddenly come and seize all our fish,"" he said. ""But that has absolutely no logic. Fishing rights are worked out on historic data, so it's absurd to suggest Norway's waters would be invaded like that."" Because Norway is outside the EU, he points out, its processed fish products face high EU import tariffs — 12 per cent in the case of smoked salmon — as do the country's agricultural products. In return, French cheese imports to Norway are taxed at 400 per cent. Oil, gas and manufactured products can be traded freely with the EU, because EEA members submit to all the directives connected with the Single Market. ""We are the most obedient ... rapidly implementing directives to the letter, yet we have no say in them,"" said Marit Warncke, who is managing director of the Bergen's chamber of commerce. ""We are sitting outside in the corridors, instead of being at the decision table."" Nor is membership of the EEA without costs, she points out. Through it, Norway contributes €340million a year to the EU. Were the UK to leave the EU, its annual contribution through the EEA might fall to just €2billion from the current net contribution of €11.6 billion. Some argue that losing the right to a say on policy would be too high a price. Charles Grant, the founder of the Centre for European Reform, said: ""The City of London represents 75 per cent of Europe's financial markets, and it would be ridiculous to be sidelined like that."" In Bergen there is little enthusiasm for changing the status quo, but the debate continues. ""People don't realise what is actually going on,"" said Mrs Warncke. ""They think we are in a bubble, and just bobbing along quite happily. ""But we need to be more engaged in Europe for our own good — and Britain should not even consider leaving. None of us can just sit here alone and eat fish."""
Live: Asia markets lower amid weak US jobs data,Norway,"0550 Brent crude climbed toward $99 a barrel today as failed labour talks in Norway stoked worries of a total output shutdown, while hopes China would ease monetary policy and improve fuel demand also supported prices. Brent rose 62 cents to $98.81 a barrel after settling up a slight 0.4 per cent last week in choppy trade supported by supply disruption fears from the Norway oil workers’ strike and a launch of tough Western sanctions targeting Iranian crude exports. US crude was up 45 cents to $84.90 after falling 0.6 per cent last week as tepid jobs growth in the United States dragged down global markets on Friday. 0420 China’s inflation rate slowed to 2.2 per cent in June, official data showed today, giving the government further room to move as it seeks to reignite growth in the world’s second biggest economy. The country’s consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.2 per cent year-on-year in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said, which was the lowest rate since the start of 2010 according to previously released figures. The inflation rate for the first half of 2012 was 3.3 percent, the bureau said. Economists predicted inflation would likely fall further this year. China’s producer price index, an advance indicator of future inflation, fell 2.1 per cent in June from the same month a year earlier, data from the bureau showed. Food prices, which have been a key component of rising prices in China since early 2010, were up 3.8 per cent in June, the bureau said, while non-food prices rose 1.4 percent. Inflationary pressures have hounded China since the start of 2010, although they have dropped in recent months alongside a general slowing in the economy. This has given the government some flexibility in trying to reboot growth, and the central bank last week cut interest rates for the second time in a month. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao yesterday called for more aggressive moves to keep growth on track. 0250 Japan’s current account surplus plunged 62.6 per cent in May from a year earlier, deteriorating for the 15th straight month, official data release today has showed. The surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of trade with the rest of the world, stood at 215.1 billion yen ($2.7 billion), the finance ministry said. “A surplus in the current account shrank substantially due to an expansion in its trade and service deficit as well as a contraction in investment income surplus from a year earlier,"" the ministry said. Economists had expected a surplus of 511 billion yen, according to Dow Jones Newswires. The current account measures trade in goods, services, tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the difference between Japan’s income from foreign sources against payments on foreign obligations and excludes net capital investment. 0220 Taiwan stocks have fallen 0.91 per cent, joining a regional decline after sluggish US jobs data, with HTC Corp shedding 3.11 per cent after the smartphone maker saw second-quarter profit more than halve. Some analysts also predicted HTC will be upstaged in the second half by strong sales of Samsung’s Galaxy S III and Apple’s upcoming new iPhone. The main TAIEX index fell 66.87 points to 7,301.72, after ending down 0.26 per cent in the previous session. Plastics counters were the main drag, down 2.06 per cent. Electronics shares lost 0.95 per cent, while financial shares fell 0.67 per cent. 0200 Greece’s new three-party coalition government won a vote of confidence in parliament early this morning, ending a period of uncertainty that led to two elections in less than two months, though the country has a long way to go to emerge from a deep recession and pay down its huge debt. There were no surprises in the vote. All 179 deputies of the three parties supporting the government - conservative New Democracy, the socialist PASOK and the moderate leftist Democratic Left - voted in favour. Voting against were the 121 deputies of the Radical Left Coalition (Syriza), the nationalist right Independent Greeks, the extreme right Golden Dawn and the Communist Party. In his concluding speech just before the vote, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said that despite their diverse political backgrounds, the three coalition partners have a unity of purpose to keep the country in the Eurozone and out of its deepest and longest recession, now in its fifth year. In the third quarter, the country’s GDP had its sharpest drop yet, declining 9.1 per cent compared to the same period in 2011. Greece’s battered economy is forecast to shrink 6.7 per cent for the whole year, far above earlier official forecasts of a 4.5 per cent shrinkage. “Us three, we have admitted our past mistakes and we are now embarked in a common cause,"" he said, addressing the opposition. “You keep clinging to your own dogmas and the same old populist logic. ... Unfortunately, (our opponents) don’t seem to have matured. Fortunately, we don’t take them seriously,"" he said. 0130 Australian shares slumped 0.9 per cent in early trade this morning as investors digested a sluggish US employment report which fanned fears about slowing global growth and pushed commodity prices lower.

On the ASX 24, the June share price index futures contract was down 38 points at 4,087, with 6,250 contracts traded.

Live: Spanish borrowing back in danger zone,Norway,"1515 Spain will create a single ’bad bank’ to house the country’s soured assets while its other lenders increase their core capital buffers to 9 per cent in return for up to €100 billion in European aid, according to one Government source. Eurozone leaders have promised to help Spain’s banks, left laden with bad debts when a property bubble burst four years ago, after it became clear that with one in four workers out of a job the country could not manage the crisis without some form of outside help. 1430 More from Draghi, who said in his introductory statement today[http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120709.en.html] that virtually all countries are undertaking measures to improve fiscal solidity, adding that “despite the current challenges, countries’ progress is strong and the fundamentals of the euro area as a whole are sound"". 1400 Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), testifying at the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee today warned that effective crisis resolution not only requires bold actions by central banks but also “needs bold actions by other policy actors, notably governments."" Mr Draghi went on to emphasise that the “euro is here to stay"" and that eurozone leaders “will take the necessary steps to ensure that."" 1330 Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, will tomorrow outline further budget savings, paving the way for Europe to grant the eurozone’s fourth-largest economy an extra year to reach its deficit targets. No final decision is expected at a meeting of EU finance ministers for a bailout of Spain’s banks, but a wider gathering of finance chiefs tomorrow is set to ease a debt goal that has pressured Madrid to make punishing cuts that are exacerbating a recession. A diplomat today said that giving Spain an extra year was “not a unilateral move,"" adding that “Spain needs to make the necessary cuts to reach that goal and this will be discussed on Tuesday at the Ecofin [meeting of ministers]. I expect the extra year to be granted."" 1300 Fears over the world’s biggest economy persist as a disappointing US jobs report — showing a further weakening of growth[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/markets/article3467885.ece] — continues to hit markets. London’s FTSE 100 share index dipped 0.38 per cent, or 21 points, to 5,641, while Frankfurt’s DAX slid 0.03 per cent and the CAC 40 in Paris is down 0.23 per cent. 1230 Graham Keeley writes: Spain is to create a “bad bank"" to house toxic assets from the collapse of its building boom, a government source confirmed to The Times. Spanish banks must also raise core capital to 9 per cent as part of the conditions to receive a €100 billion bailout. Madrid is to sign an agreement in Brussels today. The bailout will run for 15 years with an interest rate of between 3 and 4 per cent. The centre-right governnment had for some time opposed the creation of a bad bank, insisting Spanish banks could sort out their own problems. 1145 The drought may be officially over but the same does not apply to the UK jobs market. Job creation in Britain dipped to a near three-year low in June as employers viewed the future less optimistically than at any time since 2007, signalling a likely spike in unemployment days after policymakers moved to shore up an ailing economy. Today’s Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and KPMG jobs survey showed that, last month, numbers of permanent placements fell at the sharpest rate in almost three years. 1130 Graham Keeley reports from Madrid: Cristobal Montoro, the Spanish Finance Minister, today hinted at a VAT rise that is expected to be announced on Wednesday. In a speech at a business event, Mr Montoro said: “We pay little in comparison with other countries.We are in transit towards a lower direct tax regime and a higher indirect tax regime."" Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish Prime Minister, is expected to raise VAT to 18 per cent across the board. For some goods it is just 8 per cent. It will form part of a €30 billion tax and cuts package designed to please Brussels. 1100 Prices in Greece increased by 1.3 per cent in June compared with the same period last year, fuelled by a 5.7 per cent increase in accommodation costs, a 2.7 per cent jump in the cost of restaurants and hotels and a 2 per cent rise in the cost of non-alcoholic beverages and food. 1030 France’s central bank said it expects the country’s economy to have shrunk in the second quarter, with business sentiment worsening under the weight of weak domestic demand and higher taxes. The Bank of France today stuck with last month’s forecast for a 0.1 per cent GDP contraction, leaving the near €2 trillion (£1.6 trillion) economy — which posted zero growth in the first three months of the year — on the brink of recession. Opening an industrial relations conference, French President François Hollande said the economy would remain flat over the first half of the year. 1000 Spanish ten-year government bond yields rose another ten basis points this morning to reach 7.08 per cent, passing the critical level — breached during the day on Friday — that prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts and a surge seen as unsustainable in the longer-term. Ten-year Italian bond yields are also up a similar amount at 6.13 per cent, with both coming under additional pressure as dealers attempt to cheapen paper ahead of an auction at the end of the week. Officials have agreed to help Spain and Italy by allowing the eurozone’s bailout funds to buy bonds from the market and to directly recapitalise ailing banks in both countries. 0930 The FTSE 100 has lost some ground to be down 23 points, or 0.4 per cent, at 5,639. 0845 Germany’s Federal Statistical Office said that exports rose in May despite difficulties in the eurozone, but the trade balance narrowed as imports increased by an even greater amount. Exports in May rose by a seasonally adjusted 3.9 per cent, while imports rose by 6.3 per cent compared with the previous month. Exports fell by 2.3 per cent to eurozone areas, but rose 0.2 per cent elsewhere in the European Union compared with May last year. The drop was offset by a 3.4 per cent gain to non-EU countries. 0815 China’s main stock index closed at a six-month low after the latest data showed that the world’s second-largest economy is slowing down more rapidly than forecast. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.4 per cent at 2,170 points, erasing a 1 per cent rise on Friday when the market was temporarily boosted by the central bank’s second cut in official interest rate this year to boost the economy. China’s consumer and producer prices eased more than expected in June, the latest official data showed today, signaling falling demand for goods and the likelihood of more growth-supporting policy moves from Beijing. Banks, which tend to be more vulnerable amid an economic slowdown, were among the bigger losers, with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China falling 2.8 per cent. 0805 The FTSE 100 is off to a lacklustre start, up just 2 points at 5,664. Frankfurt and Paris are also flat, while Milan and Madrid have posted modest gains. 0730 The new three-party coalition Government in Greece has won a vote of confidence in parliament. All 179 deputies of the three parties supporting the Government - conservative New Democracy, the socialist Pasok and the moderate leftist Democratic Left - voted in favour. The 121 voting against included deputies of the Radical Left Coalition (Syriza), the nationalist right Independent Greeks, the extreme right Golden Dawn and the Communist Party. 0630 Asian stocks were lower today after a disappointing US jobs report last week stoked concern that the world’s biggest economy remains mired in weak growth. The US economy added a less than expected 80,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. The tepid employment growth, which followed the first drop in US manufacturing in three years, increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement monetary stimulus measures known as quantitative easing. In Asia today Japan’s Nikkei225 index fell 0.8 per cent to 8,953.11 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 1.5 per cent to 19,495.88. South Korea’s Kospi slipped 1.3 per cent to 1,834.08. Australia’s S&P;/ASX 200 dropped 0.7 per cent to 4,130.70 and China’s Shanghai Composite shed 1.1 per cent to 2,199.16. Meanwhile Inflation figures for China released today showed the consumer price index at its lowest since January 2010. That will give Beijing leeway to continue adding stimulus to fight an economic slowdown. 0550 Brent crude climbed toward $99 a barrel today as failed labour talks in Norway stoked worries of a total output shutdown, while hopes China would ease monetary policy and improve fuel demand also supported prices. Brent rose 62 cents to $98.81 a barrel after settling up a slight 0.4 per cent last week in choppy trade supported by supply disruption fears from the Norway oil workers’ strike and a launch of tough Western sanctions targeting Iranian crude exports. US crude was up 45 cents to $84.90 after falling 0.6 per cent last week as tepid jobs growth in the United States dragged down global markets on Friday. 0420 China’s inflation rate slowed to 2.2 per cent in June, official data showed today, giving the government further room to move as it seeks to reignite growth in the world’s second biggest economy.

"The big cut; The age of austerity has cast a deep pall over the arts in Europe. With even the venerable Uffizi renting itself out these days, Robert Everett-Green ponders culture's future on the continent",Norway,"For Canadian artists, Europe often looks like the land of plenty, where governments subsidize cultural activities on a fantastic scale. But these days, European culturati are an embattled lot, especially in the euro states now writhing under the austerity diktats of the IMF and the euro zone's own bailout agency. While they hack away at pensions, welfare and unemployment benefits, some governments feel they have no choice but to do a hard prune of cultural spending too. Greek cuts to cultural budgets have run so deep (35 per cent since 2009) that thieves are raiding under-guarded museums, and archeologists are running a public poster campaign, urging people to “support Greek cultural heritage against IMF cuts.” In Italy, where the IMF is still just a dark shadow on the horizon, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence is renting itself out for fashion shows, and Rome's MAXXI Museum has been placed under state receivership. The building opened just two years ago and was feted internationally for its splashy design by architect Zaha Hadid, but after its €7-million ($8.7-million) subsidy shrank by 43 per cent, the museum could barely cover staff wages. Paradoxically, while national governments wield the shears, European Union ministers in Brussels are proposing a vastly expanded, €1.8-billion ($2.24-billion) arts program for the whole euro zone. This could be the cultural side of German chancellor Angela Merkel's recent call for “more Europe” – by which she seems to mean more centralized control over the affairs of enfeebled debtor states. The bailout states – Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain – have lost or are losing recourse to bond markets, and have no apparent choice but to bend to IMF demands. Italy is cutting pre-emptively, in hopes of staying in charge of its own affairs. Greece and Italy were already at the low end of European arts funding before the current crisis began (in 2006, even Canada spent five times as much as Greece on culture, on a per capita basis). Both countries are rich in historic sites that have to be maintained, in a tourism market severely depressed by headline speculation that the common currency may be doomed. In Spain, the pain has also come through troubles afflicting the savings banks (or cajas) whose philanthropic foundations have been huge sponsors of cultural activity. The Fundación Caja Madrid recently closed the 48 cultural centres it maintained around the country. Government cuts are putting a chill on other private donations, and are jacking up already dire unemployment levels. A recent Ideas Foundation report says that Spain could lose 60,000 jobs in the labour-intensive cultural sector over the next four years. “Big cuts in budgets for culture create a climate of despair for artists and cultural professionals,” says Androulla Vassiliou of the European Commission, which has proposed a dramatic increase in the EU's centralized cultural funding. The non-legislative commission, which directs EU policy and manages its budget, wants to bump up cultural spending by 35 per cent over the next six years, with a €1.8-billion Creative Europe scheme and guarantees for up to €1-billion in loans to small cultural producers. Culture Action Europe, an umbrella group of 80,000 cultural organizations, responded poetically, and somewhat fearfully, that Creative Europe “is an idea too great to be dealt away with just a sigh.” Others fretted at the thicket of red tape a robust transnational fund operating in several languages might generate. The fate of the proposal should be known by year's end. The EU initiative assumes that culture is not an expense, but an investment – an idea also dear to the embattled Irish government, lashed to the wheel of bailout-related austerity measures but unwilling to inflict more than modest trims to culture. It actually increased its film funding last year by 4 per cent. “For every €1 of Irish Film Board investment, close to €10 is generated in the economy,” says Irish arts and heritage minister Jimmy Deenihan. The country counts about 10,000 jobs in film production, on movies such as the Glenn Close cross-dressing vehicle Albert Nobbs and Steven Soderbergh's Haywire. But while Dublin and Brussels are both focused on the economic side of culture, the sovereignty implications of their initiatives are quite different. A bigger EU role in cultural funding, at a time when some states are struggling, would concentrate more power in the centre, and possibly in the hands of the dominant northern contributors. Angela Merkel suggested earlier this year that Greece's budget decisions should be subject to a veto by an EU steward. Greece rejected that proposal, and with other bailout states such as Italy and Portugal, has questioned the wisdom of a Creative Europe scheme. Germany, of course, can still pull its own considerable weight as a cultural-industries player. Berlin alone still accounts for nearly €1-billion ($1.25-billion) in government subsidies. Norway, which outspent Ireland on culture by a factor of 10 before the crisis began (on a per capita basis), can still rely on oil wealth to support its artists. The piper in those countries is well paid. In others, he may soon have to look to Brussels for money to keep playing. ***** SIGNS OF TROUBLE Olympia Museum, Athens Two thieves overpowered a lone female guard in January, and made off with 77 artifacts. The Greek culture minister resigned in disgrace, but security remains scant at Greece's many museums and ancient sites. MAXXI Museum, Rome The swank two-year-old museum was taken over by the Italian culture ministry in May, after failing to surmount a €3-million ($3.7-million) cut to its €10-million ($12.5-million) budget. Culture ministry, Portugal No longer exists. Its functions were “rationalized” into a new caretaker agency in March. Centro sperimentale di cinematografica, Italy Much of the leadership of Europe's oldest film school was purged last week, as part of a government-ordered reorganization that may result in the closure of four regional centres. Uffizi Gallery, Florence The gallery rented itself out for its first-ever fashion show last month, one day after Madonna paid €19,000 ($23,700) for a private, two-hour tour. Robert Everett-Green"
Left out in the cold?; Canada a laggard in global race for Arctic resources,Norway,"The five hotels of the Northwest Territories town of Norman Wells (population: 800) saw more than their fair share of hard hats last year. ""You could not get a room there for six months last winter,"" said David Ramsay, Northwest Territories' minister of transportation industry, tourism and investment. ""Grocery stores saw a 100% increase in sales; it was unprecedented economic activity for that period of time - we are going to see even more this coming winter."" Norman Wells is not alone in witnessing this bonanza. Towns and communities across the vast Arctic landscape are waking up to the riches that lie buried beneath, as oil executives scope for prospects and Arctic governments take another 'strategic' look at the region's hydrocarbon and mineral riches. The area shared by Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States offers an estimated 46 trillion cubic metres of undiscovered global natural gas, or 30% of the global total. In addition, it holds 90 billion barrels of oil - or 13% of the estimated global total of undiscovered oil, according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey. While the Arctic's resource potential has been known for decades, the North Pole has historically presented a daunting logistical challenge. Until now. In what may be described as an environmentalist's worst nightmare, global warming and melting ice in the Arctic are rewarding oil companies with access to its thawing oil, gas and mineral deposits through greater shipping access. But that's just part of the equation. ""Climate change has reduced the barrier to entry - it is definitely an enabling factor,"" says Charles Emmerson, who wrote The Future History of the Arctic and is a senior research fellow at London-based Chatham House. He believes the entire Arctic area could see investments of more than $100-billion over the next decade, primarily in oil and gas, mining and shipping. ""Other key drivers include improved technology. Secondly, the cost of producing the fields may be less than before, and more importantly, the price for oil is right - not so much for gas."" Big Oil is also running out of places to drill. With stateowned enterprises shutting off oil majors in much of the Middle East and Latin America, the Arctic presents itself as a meltingly tempting prospect. But Canada may have to wait a little while longer, as oil majors focus on other opportunities. Moscow, Oslo and Washington already have Arctic projects underway and have drawn up far more advanced plans to exploit the region, potentially leaving Ottawa behind in the global (sled) race for Arctic resources. ""When I look at Canadian Arctic energy exploration, I see a litany of missed opportunities in the past,"" says Mr. Emmerson, who argues that mineral mining offers a better medium-term prospect in the Canadian North than hydrocarbons. ""But that's not necessarily such a bad thing. There are all kinds of environmental consequences of drilling for oil and gas. Canadian Arctic is one of the most remote parts of the Arctic. So if something were to go wrong, it would be incredibly hard to deal with."" Of course, Ottawa already has enough energy environmental concerns to deal with in the Alberta oil sands, and may not have the political appetite to take on environmentalists who are ramping up their global campaign against Arctic development. Which puts N.W.T. and Nunavut in a bind as the federal government controls sale of land and resources in the two Arctic territories. The premiers of the Yukon, N.W.T. and Nunavut met this month and pushed for greater say in the country energy's policy and on the intergovernmental Arctic Council - an association of coastal states and other interested parties that periodically discuss security, environment emergency response and development. Mr. Ramsay hopes the N.W.T. government will wrap up devolution negotations with Ottawa by 2014 and fasttrack its energy plans. By that time natural gas prices may have rebounded from their decade low, making N.W.T.'s centrepiece $16billion Mackenzie Gas Project feasible. The pipeline, which was stuck in Canada's regulatory quagmire for nine years, has now been shelved due to poor economic feasibility. The Mackenzie Gas project is not the only one up N.W.T.'s sleeves, with a total of 81 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 7 billion barrels of oil ""waiting to be taken,"" according to the minister. Husky Energy Inc. is building a 36-kilometre all-weather road between Norman Wells and Tulita, while Chevron Corp. is planning seismic exploration in the area this year. The government also recently sold two parcels north of Norman Wells, generating $92million in work commitment. Overall, the industry has committed close to $630-million of exploration over the next four to five years. But for now, the gas remains buried. With lower Canada and the United States awash in oil and shale gas, the idea of laying a gas pipeline through some of the underdeveloped Arctic plains may not be appealing, especially at $2 per British thermal unit of gas. Nunavut, which is estimated to hold a quarter of Canada's conventional oil reserves, is much further behind the N.W.T. in its devolution discussions with Ottawa. But negotiations have finally begun, said Peter Taptuna, Nunavut's minister of economic development and transportation, who has noted rising interest in lands along the southern reaches of the Sverdrup Basin, estimated to hold 500 million barrels of oil and 27 tcf of gas. ""In the next few years we may see renewed exploration occurring there,"" Mr. Taptuna said. Promising exploratory drilling in West Greenland waters has also led to considerable interest in the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. The federal government has begun research and the area could see a 'call for nominations' within a few years, Mr. Taptuna says. In the eastern Arctic, offshore of Baffin Island, estimates place the oil potential in the range of 10 billion to 30 billion barrels. Farther south, toward the Labrador Sea, there is an estimated two tcf to four tcf of gas reserves. Most of it may not see the light of the long Arctic days anytime soon.

"Arctic wilderness faces pollution threats as oil and gas giants target its riches: Melting ice caps, the influx of trawlers and tourists and Shell's pounds 4bn investment to drill for fossil fuels in the Chukchi Sea all raise fears of environmental havoc",Norway,"It is home to a quarter of the planet's oil and natural gas reserves, yet humans have hardly touched these resources in the far north. But in a few days that could change dramatically if Shell receives approval to drill for oil in the Arctic. The company has invested $4bn to set up exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea, north of the Bering Straits. Once permission is given by the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, - possibly in a few weeks - exploration will begin using wells in Arctic waters. And that will bring trouble. Environment campaigners say that drilling could have terrible effects on the waters and wildlife of the Arctic. ""It took a vast effort to clean up the recent spill in the Gulf of Mexico,"" said John Sauven of Greenpeace. ""There are no such resources to stop a spill in the Chukchi. The consequences could be devastating and very long lasting."" But Shell rejects this claim. It has an oil spill response capability that includes barges, helicopters, booms, and other equipment should anything happen, said an official. Drilling will be safe. Exploiting the Arctic's vast oil reserves is just one cause of environmental unease, however. The far north is melting and far faster than predicted. Global temperatures have risen 0.7C since 1951. In Greenland, the average temperature has gone up by 1.5C. Its ice cap is losing an estimated 200bn tonnes a year as a result. And further rises are now deemed inevitable, causing the region's ice to disappear long before the century's end. As a result, global powers are beginning to look to the region for its gas and oil, minerals, fish, sea routes and tourist potential. All were once hidden by ice. Now it is disappearing, raising lucrative prospects for Arctic nations, in particular Russia, the US, Canada, Norway and Denmark, which controls Greenland. Large-scale investment could bring riches to areas of poverty, it is argued. However, development could destroy pristine ecosystems and the ways of life for people like the Inuit of Greenland and the Sami of Scandinavia. One example is highlighted by Professor Callum Roberts, a York University marine biologist. An ice-free Arctic could be stripped of its rich fisheries in a matter of years, he told the Observer. ""There are significant fish resources under the Arctic ice at present. But as that ice disappears, that protection will be removed and we can expect a rush from fishing fleets to exploit them. They have already stripped the North Atlantic of its cod, ling and other fish. Now they have their eyes on the Arctic."" Currently only one fishing ground in the Arctic is protected: the area around the Bering Straits, where the US has imposed a moratorium. Elsewhere there is nothing to stop fleets moving in as ice disappears. ""The north polar seas have provided fish like the cod with a last refuge. That may not last much longer."" Other changes are less worrying. Two new sea routes have opened up as ice has retreated: the Northwest Passage across the northern edge of Canada and the Northern Sea Route across Russia. The latter is seen as the most promising. Instead of heading south, and through the Suez canal, to get to western Europe, ships from east Asia can sail through the Bering Straits and slip along the coast of Siberia, shaving a third off their journey. In 2010, four ships took this route. Last summer, this increased to 34, with many more expected this year. Then there is tourism. Today, thanks to that disappearing ice, you can follow the route John Franklin took on his doomed 1845 expedition. Adventure Canada, a tour company, operates a cruise ship that can carry up to 200 people through the islands of northern Canada where Franklin and his men becoming trapped by ice and turned to cannibalism in a bid to survive. The voyage begins in Greenland and ends in Coppermine, in western Canada, at a price of $7,000-$17,000 a head. ""We have had the market much to ourselves since we started in 2008, but this year we have found other companies have started sniffing around,"" said Rebecca Burgum of Adventure Canada. However, it is the prospect of oil drilling that causes most unease. Apart from Shell, Norway's Statoil, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Russia's Rosneft have all revealed plans to drill in the Arctic. Given the huge amounts of hydrocarbons there, this enthusiasm is not surprising. But there are dangers in drilling in the far north that do not exist elsewhere, warns a recent report by the insurance market Lloyds, Arctic Opening: Opportunity and Risk in the High North. In particular, there is the problem of drilling through the permafrost, which could warm up and destabilise a well's foundations, ""potentially leading to a blowout"". In addition, icebreakers are in short supply along with Arctic-class mobile rigs that could drill relief wells in the event of a spill. In short, great caution will be needed before the Arctic oil industry moves from exploration to full production by the end of the decade. Changes are certainly coming to the Arctic. Indeed, if some scientists are correct, it could be transformed at a far quicker rate than politicians or businessmen realise. Most follow current advice that it will take at least a couple of decades for the Arctic to lose its ice. However, Peter Wadhams, a professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, believes that it will take much less time. ""I think it could be gone in summer in four years. It sounds unlikely but that is what the figures indicate,"" he told the Observer from Longyearbyen, in Svalbard, in Norway's northern Arctic archipelago. Wadhams has just completed a study of ice thickness. Using robot submarines, he has made detailed measurements of the depths of ice sheets, while aircraft have surveyed the heights of these floes. ""Our work indicates that Arctic ice has lost 70% of its volume in the past 30 years thanks to global warming. If you extrapolate, it means it could disappear completely for a month or two in summer by 2016. Certainly it is going to go sooner rather than later."" The consequences for the planet will be grim. Without the white brilliance of the ice to reflect sunlight back into space, it will warm even more. Seabed temperatures will rise and methane deposits will melt, evaporate and bubble into the atmosphere. ""We can already see plumes appearing in many areas,"" said Wadhams. ""Given that methane is a particularly powerful greenhouse gas, that again will accelerate global warming."" Finally, the ice sheets of Greenland, no longer insulated by sea ice around its shores, will melt faster, raising sea levels. ""In effect, we are at the mercy of events up here,"" said Wadhams.

Europe left looking for a shortcut in race for resources,Norway,"Inside every wind turbine, inside computers, phones and other hi-tech equipment from medical scanners to electric cars, are materials known as rare earths. This small group of 17 elements are in extraordinary demand - but their supply is limited, and most existing sources have been snapped up by China. Last month Beijing - which controls more than 90% of the reserves of these essential elements - warned that its supplies were diminishing, despite quotas to limit exports. Chinese officials said in a memo: ""After more than 50 years of excessive mining, China's rare earth reserves have kept declining and the years of guaranteed rare earth supply have been reducing."" This could spell disaster for the future of green technologies such as renewable energy and low-carbon vehicles. That is why Europe has been engaging in a strenuous bout of diplomacy with Greenland to allow access to the island's natural resources. The scramble for the Arctic is part of a bigger pattern, a looming resource crunch that connects commuters across Europe delayed by stolen power lines or vanishing manhole covers - a crunch fuelled by pressure on crucial commodities across the world. Rapid economic growth in large developing nations - China, India, Brazil and others - along with growing urbanisation and a swelling global population have made unprecedented demands on natural resources. In the past few years there have been food crises, soaring fossil fuel prices and hikes in the cost of traditional raw materials such as iron, steel and copper, as well as the rare earths. Countries in control of such resources can take a commanding position in the world economy. China realised this years ago and has not only cornered the market in rare earths but embarked on a land grab to secure its food supplies. Other countries have been slower off the mark, but are trying to catch up. This race for resources is threatening some of the world's most fragile environments, from the Arctic to the Amazon, from Madagascar to Papua New Guinea. Recognising this, Europe's prospective partnerships extend well beyond Greenland. ""We are working with Africa - and in particular South Africa, where there is an abundance of many important raw materials,"" said Antonio Tajani, vice-president of the European commission. ""The EU is signing an agreement with the African Union and we have also signed an agreement on raw materials with Chile, Argentina, Uruguay. We now even have a dialogue with China and Russia for the first time."" In return, according to Tajani, Europe can offer its expertise. ""Technological assistance is something we can contribute overseas,"" he said. ""This will be valuable to other economies."" Tajani also said Europe must seek to use resources better, wasting less and recycling more: ""We want better resource efficiency. One of the uses of the economic crisis is that it has become more important for companies to show competitiveness by being more efficient with resources, and of course for a green economy this is also a top priority."" The reuse of resources would also be key, he said. ""Recycling is very important; we need to do more recycling in Europe. At present, we ship a lot of waste to China but why not do more of it in Europe? If we send abroad, we have all the side costs associated, but if we do it here we develop another industry that is very important for raw materials for industry,"" he said. ""If we do this efficiently, we can export technology to other countries that need to be regulated properly."" He also urged a new focus on finding resources within the continent that have been overlooked, abandoned, or deemed uneconomic to extract until now. ""Many mines were left unexploited, but now we can extract more cost-efficiently and so we are looking at areas where we can do that,"" Tajani said. He pointed to Greece as one area where more resource extraction could take place. Some of Greece's potential mining areas remain underexploited, in part because of increasing pressure on the land and because the focus of the economy shifted to tourism. Tajani is keen to explore mining activities on Europe's densely populated landmass - including ""urban mining"". At present, this is rarely practised because of the difficulty of putting mining operations into inhabited areas, but with the advance of greener techniques it could become more viable. This would mean people being closer to mines, with all the environmental and development difficulties that entails. Such operations could also include mining old landfill sites for materials - in China, companies have been excavating rubbish tips for silicon and other components for use in solar panels. Eastern Europe may also offer some potential for increasing the production of existing mines, according to Tajani. Beyond that, however, and a few areas of the Arctic and Barents Sea, the scope for extracting new resources from Europe is limited, making Greenland an attractive proposition. Greenland's resources could include nearly 50bn barrels of oil, a massive potential resource for the EU as most of Europe's currently exploited oil and gas fields belong to Norway, a non-EU member. But if new oil and gas could be found within less explored waters, that would also be a prize. Tajani pointed to the Barents Sea - within the Arctic Circle - as another possibility. Greenpeace has mounted a strong campaign to protect Arctic waters from oil and gas drilling. The conservation group argues that recovering these fossil fuels is dangerous not only for the climate, but also for the pristine environment because oil spills or blowouts of the type that blighted the Gulf of Mexico would have catastrophic consequences. By contrast, Greenpeace is not opposing mining on the ice sheet if it is tightly regulated. For Greenpeace, the urgent demand for renewable energy technology means mining for rare earths can be environmentally beneficial - if it is done in the right way. ""Mining can be controllable, in a way that is not possible with deep sea drilling,"" says Jon Burgwald, an Arctic expert at Greenpeace. ""We are keeping a close eye on this, and we could oppose [developments] if we saw they were not being done right, but there is no doubt that opening up for mining in Greenland still could have a very positive impact.""

Holiday fall victim loses fight for life,Norway,"A SCOT has lost his two–month fight for life after plunging 110ft from a hotel balcony. Garry Masson, 28, suffered massive head injuries in the fall. The offshore worker, from Turriff, Aberdeenshire, had been living and working in Thailand. The horrific accident happened in Pattaya, on June 17. Mr Masson was flown to Aberdeen on July 16 but his condition deteriorated last week and he died at the city's Royal Infirmary. His brother Brian, 33, said yesterday said it was still unclear how Mr Masson fell. The family was told he had been with friends in a hotel apartment at the time. Garry Brian said: ""It was in the early afternoon, but we have no idea what happened. ""Garry's friends called an ambulance. The medical staff were good and got him to hospital quickly. ""You hear about it happening to other people but don't expect it to happen to your family."" Mr Masson worked for drilling firm Ocean Rig for several years and enjoyed catching up with friends in Thailand after his four–week stints offshore. Brian described his brother as a devoted family man, who always visited relatives when he returned home. He added: ""Garry loved travelling. He worked on oil rigs abroad and had travelled to Greenland and Norway and had even been working in the Falkland Islands. He went to quite a few places. ""He had a great sense of humour. He was outgoing and really lived life to the full. My brother was well known and liked by a lot of people."" A record number of young Britons have been involved in similar accidents while on holidays abroad this year. Three were killed and 10 seriously injured. Nine of the accidents happened in Majorca or Ibiza, two of the most popular UK tourist destinations. The Foreign Office and travel group ABTA have joined forces on a campaign to try to warn young people of the dangers."
Where the wild swims are,Norway,"A close Saturday afternoon next to the River Ouse in Sussex, where - so the wild-swimming book tells us - you can ""swim for over two miles through remote countryside, with only the spire of Isfield church in sight for the entire journey"". Drawing up by a bridge, a family cross in front of us carrying a large rubber canoe, followed by a family with a wooden canoe and children wearing inflatable float suits. ""I thought this was wild swimming in remote countryside,"" I whinge to my boyfriend, Nick, who starts reversing up the road slowly, unable to see fully out of the back window past our towels and the multipacks of Doritos. ""Let's go and ask at the tourist board,"" he says soothingly, coming to a halt and turning his attention to the map. Nick sets a lot of store by the tourist board, whereas I just think they're going to make me go and look at oil being ground from nuts. The tourist board is shut so we drive back to the river (""Oh, look, there's a Waitrose"") and trudge along its banks. I'm telling you, the whole of East Sussex is out wild swimming, like in Norway, although there they just call it swimming. Truly, all human life is here. NCT reunions on the banks. Guys slowly drinking cans of Foster's, recovering from what looks like a stag do. Bald men in wetsuits doing a slow front crawl through half-eaten cobs of corn feed floating in the brown water that gangs of cows in the field have chucked in for their amusement. Standing at the edge, a group of teenagers ball up their fists beneath their chins, shaking water off themselves like dogs, laughing hysterically, working the crowd. ""Is that a human poo down there?"" shrieks one, pointing past the damselflies and in-leaning weeds. ""Tell us what that is. That! Is that a human poo?"" The Outdoor Swimming Society recently reported that when it launched in 2006, the term ""wild swimming"" hadn't even taken off as a phrase, but, by 2010, it was already considering closing its website. Job done: England had become a fortuitous collection of multi-aged Speedo-wearers living day to day without sickness or need of foreign travel. Even our wretched weather doesn't stop the (still live) site from attracting more than 30,000 new hits a week. And it seems to me that the whole movement is more than anything born of a deep, ineradicable nostalgia - a half-false, half-fantasised memory patched together from children's books, of floating on our backs at one with the mulch beneath and experiencing great love for, oh, time and life and people and all the sorts of feelings you have when you're younger, and I'm totally all for it and everything … only recently I've started sensing that the pressure is now irrevocably on. This summer you couldn't go for a picnic without someone looking at a puddle and saying ""after you"". By now it's late afternoon and we decide to camp right here, guerrilla style. Yeah, we're gonna wild camp. I mean if it's public water, then its public land, no? This is public land, right? ""Do you know if this is actually actual public land?"" I ask a lady unfixing the rubber ring from round the waist of her toddler. ""Erm, it might say in the car park,"" she offers. Good point. But the car park just says ""Sussex Ouse Valley Way: Accessing the Countryside"". Nick frowns and accesses the symbols on a bench further along. ""Ouse Valley Cycle Network,"" he shouts, then ""East Sussex Council: Countryside Management Footpath Crossborder Co-operation Programme (part financed by the European Union)."" ""Is this public land that you can camp on?"" I appeal to a passing dad. ""Google Earth it,"" he suggests, nicely. So Nick, like Withnail, ends up going to ask a farmer, and comes back saying, ""The farmer's wife or girlfriend or whatever says we absolutely cannot camp here and that it's owned by some mentalist who will send thugs."" ""Oh my god, Nick, we've got to get out of here immediately."" ""Yeah, but what thugs?"" questions Nick, a mocking note creeping into his voice. ""Like he has a staff of thugs? Thugs on tap?"" We remove ourselves with the promise of a Burger King in Lewes."
"The best, and worst, of Europe; Seasoned travel writer suggests places to see and places to avoid",Norway,"North Americans get the shortest vacations in the industrial world. With so little time, the pressure is on to make all the right choices when planning a trip. But how to select the right destination? It ultimately depends on your interests and your tastes - and what your experienced travel writer tells you. It's my job to sort through all the travel-industry superlatives and ""top 10"" lists. Readers naturally want to know the best, but it's just as important to know the worst. With that in mind, I've pulled together a round robin of my candid opinions on the best and worst European destinations. Here goes: Let's start with the British Isles and its dullest corner, southern Scotland. It's so boring that the Romans decided to block it off with Hadrian's Wall. But don't skip Hadrian's Wall; it covers history buffs like me with goose bumps (or goose pimples, as the English say). London, York, Bath and Edinburgh are the most interesting cities in Britain. Belfast, Liverpool, and Glasgow are quirky enough to be called interesting. Oxford pales next to Cambridge, and Stratford-upon-Avon is little more than Shakespeare's house - and it's as dead as he is. Extra caution is merited in southwest England, a minefield of tourist traps. The British are masters at milking every conceivable tourist attraction for all it's worth. Stay away from booby traps like the Devil's Toenail (a rock that looks just like a toenail), Land's End (you'll pay, pay, pay), and cloying Clovelly (a one-street knickknack town selling useless goodies). Tune out the hype around Ireland's Blarney Stone (slobbered on by countless tourists to get the ""gift of gab""), Spain's Costa del Sol resorts, and the French Riviera in July and August. These are among Europe's most overrated spots. Geneva, one of Switzerland's largest and most sterile cities, gets the ""nice place to live but I wouldn't want to visit"" award. It's pleasantly situated on a lake - just like Buffalo. Although it's famous, name familiarity is a rotten reason to go somewhere. If you want a Swiss city, see Bern or Luzerne instead. Germany's famous Black Forest disappoints more people than it excites. But the average Canadian visitor, who's seen more than three trees in one place, would prefer Germany's Romantic Road and Bavaria, or the Rhine and Mosel country - all high points that cut the Black Forest down to stumps. After Prague, Kraków (Poland) and Budapest (Hungary) are Eastern Europe's best cities. Bucharest, Romania's capital, has little to offer. Its top-selling postcard is of the InterContinental Hotel. Norway's Stavanger, famous for nearby fjords and its status as an oil boomtown, is a large port that's about as thrilling as ... well, put it this way: Emigrants left it in droves to move to the wilds of Minnesota. Your time is better spent at Sognefjord, Norway's most spectacular fjord. The most boring countryside is Sweden's (yes, I'm Norwegian). Europe's most scenic train ride is the Glacier Express across southern Switzerland. The most scenic boat ride is from Stockholm to Helsinki - countless islands and blonds. Europe's most underrated sight is Rome's ancient seaport, Ostia Antica, and its most misunderstood wine is Portugal's vinho verde (green wine). Honeymooners should try these postcard-pretty towns: Beilstein on Germany's Mosel River; Hallstatt on Austria's Lake Hallstatt; Varenna on Italy's Lake Como; Ærøskøbing on an island in south Denmark; and Gimmelwald, high in the Swiss Alps. The most pleasing French château is Vaux-le-Vicomte, near Paris. The best Gothic interior is found in Paris' Sainte-Chapelle church. The top two medieval castle interiors are Germany's Burg Eltz on the Mosel River, and northern Italy's Reifenstein. Lisbon, Oslo, Stockholm, Brussels, and Budapest are Europe's most underrated big cities. I'll close with a lightning round of ""ultimates"" (what travel writer can resist?): the ultimate medieval walled town in Germany (Rothenburg), prehistoric stone fortress in Ireland (Dún Aenghus), Riviera port town (Vernazza), hike in England's Lake District (Catbells above Keswick), neighbourhood pub in London (The Anglesea Arms), castle in North Wales (nope, I still can't pick just one) and pedestrian market street in Paris (Rue Cler). These are just my personal feelings after more than 100 months of European travel. Go ahead and disagree.

Will a warming planet and melting sea ice spur development in the Arctic? (+video),Norway,"Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to an unprecedented low this summer, part of a long-term decline in the icy white cap over the far northern ocean. Researchers predict that nearly ice-free summers are on the way, although its not yet clear when this will happen. This shift has implications for climate in particular, it is expected to aggravate global warming and for the animals, such as polar bears and walruses, which depend on the ice for habitat. But the loss of ice over the Arctic Ocean also opens up the possibility for increased shipping, tourism, oil and gas exploration, and fishing. But this potential development raises challenges with which nations will have to grapple, said Anne Siders, a postdoctoral researcher with the Columbia Center for Climate Change Law, to an audience at Columbia University Wednesday (Sept. 19). Siders was among a panel of researchers who discussed the science behind the declining sea ice, the suite of changes occurring in the Arctic and public perception of it. [10 Things You Need to Know About Arctic Sea Ice] A predictably open Arctic Ocean creates opportunities and challenges for nations that ring the Arctic. Here are some of them. The opportunities: Fishing: Warming ocean temperatures, migrating fish and changes in sea ice may create conditions favorable to the development of new commercial fisheries within the Arctic, according to the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A U.S. plan, approved in 2009, temporarily prohibits commercial fishing in U.S. Arctic waters until more information is available. More ship traffic: A journey through the Northwest Passage north of Canada or along the Northern sea route over Russia can cut thousands of miles off a trip that could otherwise require a ship to travel through the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal. Between 1906 and 2006, only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage, said Michael Byers, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. In 2010, 18 traveled through, and in 2011, 22 made the trip. As ice in the passage has dwindled, tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports. Gas and oil: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil, 1,670 trillion cubic feet (47.3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids most of it offshore. The quest for these resources is underway, in spite of setbacks. The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept. 17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast. The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier. The problems: Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem. NOAA's maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean, because thick, impenetrable sea ice kept ships out. In addition, most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s, according to NOAA. Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states, but the U.S. Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup, Siders said. Admiral Robert Papp, the Coast Guard commandant, has been quoted in the media as saying, ""The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic. If we are going to have a permanent presence there, it's going to require some investment. We don't have the infrastructure in place right now."" As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010, a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage, and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks] Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations, the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves, but the United States can't lay its own claim and has little say in others because the U.S. is not a party to the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty, CNN Money reports. There are other territorial issues as well, for instance, Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory, while other nations, including the U.S., maintain that it is an international strait. The loss of summer ice will not, however, transform the Arctic into the Caribbean. Some of the challenges to operating in the Arctic are and have been the same for a very long time, Siders said, adding these will remain at least to some degree, requiring people to work in the dark, in the cold, in the middle of a storm, as earlier arrivals have done before.

"In Remote and Rugged Shetland, a Dynamic Market",Norway,"LERWICK, SHETLAND -- Across the Shetland Islands, an archipelago in the North Atlantic between the Scottish mainland and Norway, abandoned small stone houses are scattered around the windswept, almost treeless landscape. The ruined homes -- a sight common in Scotland's islands, particularly in the Hebrides to the west of the mainland -- are the physical sign of the eviction of many crofters in the 18th and 19th centuries and, more recently, of residents' desire for modern homes with more living space. But Shetland also contains a growing number of neat, timber-frame and timber-clad homes in the gray-blue and rust shades favored in Scandinavia. They nestle in prosperous communities linked by a superbly maintained road and ferry network paid for, in great part, by revenues from the North Sea oil industry and its port facilities in Shetland. And more homes may have to be built soon: in 2008 the Shetland Islands Council set an informal target of 25,000 residents by 2025. (The results of a census in 2011 are not yet available, but the council now estimates that there are 22,500 people living on the 15 inhabited islands of Shetland's scores of islands, islets and barren rocks.) The older public, commercial and residential buildings in the center of Lerwick, Shetland's diminutive capital of about 7,500 residents, are made of stone and resolutely Victorian in style. But it is the timber-clad houses that dominate the newly built clusters of homes on the outskirts of town. ''Most of these homes come in kit form from Scandinavia and cost from £100,000 to £180,000,'' or $160,000 to $300,000, said Nick Brett, an English architect working in Lerwick. ''There is a strong culture of self-build in Shetland, even though building costs are about 25 percent higher than on the Scottish mainland.'' Oil was discovered off Shetland in 1971; in 1975, work started on an oil terminal at Sullom Voe in the north of the biggest island in Shetland (which residents call the ''mainland''). Thanks to an act of the British Parliament and a clever deal cut by the islanders, Shetland has received a cut of the value of each barrel of oil landed there. This money is controlled by the Shetland Charitable Trust, a body set up to administer, invest and spend royalties; there now is about £220 million in the fund, or about £9,800 for every resident. The oil dividend has produced many unusual changes in addition to new sports centers and comprehensive support for the aged. For example, schoolchildren from some outlying islands routinely travel to their swimming lessons in Lerwick by small plane. And several years ago, when a Royal Air Force base closed on the northernmost island of Unst, eliminating some local jobs, the council decided to stop charging for the car ferry to the next island. The colorful timber homes in Lerwick and in villages like Brae and Voe, near the oil terminal, may remind visitors not just of Norway, but also of Shetland's history: These islands were occupied by the Vikings in the 9th century and didn't become part of Scotland until the 15th century. Until the 19th century islanders spoke Norn, a now extinct Scandinavian language. ''Nobody thought that oil would have such a lasting impact,'' said Neil Henderson of the council's Economic Development Service, which tries to attract new businesses and residents to the islands. ''For Shetlanders, oil has gone far beyond its expected life. And now we have new opportunities to profit from gas and wind power, as well as decommissioning oil rigs that are no longer needed.'' Mr. Henderson said that Shetland's unemployment rate was only 1.5 percent, with fishing and fish processing also providing a lot of jobs. Eric Peterson, a lawyer in Lerwick, describes the residential real estate market as ''reasonably buoyant.'' In Shetland, it is lawyers, rather than the real estate agents who operate in most of the rest of Britain, and in England in particular, who routinely act as brokers. ''Most buyers are locals wanting to upgrade, oil sector workers or people finding work with the council,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''Apart from large laird's houses, which tend to lend themselves to use as small hotels rather than single family homes, the top end of the market here for a house is around £400,000.'' One of Mr. Peterson's offerings is a building lot with ocean views close to the village of Sandwick, 14 miles south of Lerwick, and listed at £25,000. It comprises 1,200 square meters, or about 13,000 square feet, the maximum size for most parcels without topographical problems. In spite of the open space on much of Shetland, strict rules apply to newly built homes, partly because much of the land is still worked as crofts, the traditional landholding system used in the Highlands and islands of Scotland. ''The cloak of crofting floats over the land,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''In many locations, if you want to build a home you need first to apply to the Crofting Commission in Inverness for the land to be 'de-crofted.''' Neil Risk, another lawyer, is representing the seller of a timber-frame house in East Burrafirth, some 22 miles from Lerwick. The property, offered at £142,000, has three bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, and a separate garage. Despite its challenging weather conditions and relative isolation, Shetland does have an appeal to foreigners. As Silke Reeploeg, a German resident, said: ''When you're in Shetland, you always know you're on an island. It feels remote, too.'' Ms. Reeploeg and her Argentine husband spent several years between Shetland and Tierra del Fuego, the southernmost point of Argentina, before moving permanently to Shetland in 2000. They now live in a restored croft house on the island of Bressay, a short ferry ride from Lerwick. ''There are similarities between Tierra del Fuego and Shetland,'' said Ms. Reeploeg, who is a researcher at the Shetland Center for Nordic Studies and a tourist guide. ''There is a frontier mentality here. People are self-reliant but they are friendly to outsiders, too, and there's a strong sense of place.'' The council's Web site includes 12 profiles, Ms. Reeploeg's included, of residents who came from Thailand, New Zealand, elsewhere in Britain and beyond. Mr. Henderson says the stories are an imaginative way of explaining to potential home buyers what might lie ahead. ''People can see that we have become a rich, cosmopolitan society,'' he said. Or, as Ms. Reeploeg recalled: ''It was strange when I learned to drive in Shetland. There I was, a German, being taught by an instructor from Iceland.''"
Measuring impact of North Sea oil revenues on independence,Norway,"Better Together really needs to rename itself the Doom and Gloom campaign. We have heard from the 1970s onwards that controlling our oil would bring no advantage to Scotland (“Swinney and Darling fight over oil revenue warning”, The Herald, November 19). Funny how keen the British state has been to hold on to it. Why are we expected to take Alistair Darling and his establishment colleagues seriously? They presided over economic disaster at UK level. The former Chancellor failed to regulate the financial sector (perhaps he just blames all of this on Gordon Brown), he and the Bank of England failed to understand what was happening on their watch, he allowed the UK economy to float on a sea of private debt, and he left the public sector a legacy of poor value-for-money PFI projects. Yet he has the nerve to lecture us on Scotland’s economy. Scotland has the potential to create a healthy economy in the future. The Institute for Fiscal Studies report says Scotland could more than pay for all its commitments and its debt would not be as high proportionately as the UK’s. Of course no-one can say what will happen 20 years from now. If we have no constitutional change, can anyone tell us what the British economy will be like 20 years from now? Scotland is rich in energy resources and will be even richer with the accelerating development of renewables. We have generous space in relation to our population. We have a skilled population with a high proportion of graduates. We have a good export record. We have important sectors with long-term potential in food, life sciences, specialist engineering and tourism. We have considerable social cohesion although the Westminster legacy of economic inequality undermines this. We need all the economic powers to make our own choices and develop a more sustainable and equal society. So let’s send the tired old establishment men back to their clubs. Isobel Lindsay, 9 Knocklea Place, Biggar. You offered a valuable step on the way to having something approaching informed debate on the matter of Scottish independence with coverage of the report into the possibilities of life after oil. David Kelly’s letter further emphasises the need for such informed debate (November 19). I believe there is no basis to Mr Kelly’s assertion that Scotland would double its representation in Europe and have 12 MEPs. Indeed, it would appear for that to happen there would have to be an amendment to the existing treaty which limits the total number of MEPs. In turn this would scotch the oft-spouted theory that Scotland would be welcomed with open arms as Europe would be presented with the problem of either increasing the total number of MEPs (requiring every member state to participate) or keeping the ceiling and claiming the extra seats back from the bigger countries, most likely Germany. Either way, it will involve negotiation among the member states and put further doubt against those who suggest Scotland would enter Europe on “existing terms”. Given the approach of the EU to date and the tendency to make such changes at election terms, it would appear likely that it would be 2019 at the earliest before Mr Kelly’s “boost” could be achieved. Will he be happy that, in the interim, Scotland would effectively be under-represented? Even with 12 votes we would be hardly heard against the other 750. There will be some Nationalists who would solve this little conundrum by simply deducting the seats from the rest of the UK (rUK). While that may be another possibility it would also be a major contributor to a possible euro-exit on the part of the rUK. How ironic would it be if Scotland’s independence resulted in the rUK being free of Europe? Nobody knows what independence would mean in the context of the EU. William Forbes, 23 Greenlees Park, Cambuslang. I believe I am not alone in viewing the run-up to the referendum in 2014 with some trepidation. Your coverage tells of the widely different opinions held on the future of long-term revenues from oil and gas resources and the consequences. We are almost at the end of 2012 and time is running out for some kind of measured debate to take place on the pros and cons associated with an independent Scotland. I fear we are to be faced with party political posturing on further fundamental issues, such as Nato and the future defence of our country, membership of the EU, fiscal and monetary policy, levels of taxpayer-funded benefits, and the need for a governor-general in the event of the Queen continuing as head of state. One can be forgiven for feeling at times that one would get more helpful advice from a philosopher of the sophist school. Standing with a pen in hand in 2014 in the polling booth, is the bemused voter really being asked to make the equivalent of a leap in the dark with the landing place uncertain, or to go on a mystery tour with the precise destination still to be defined? Ian W Thomson, 38 KIirkintilloch Road, Lenzie. While no-one would want to accuse the Institute for Fiscal Studies, or report author David Phillips, of “scaremongering” or worse, it seems from the report that an “examination of “the fiscal consequences for Scotland if it were to leave the UK” is both narrow and shallow. The oil industry reports itself that it only forecasts oil recovery for 40 years in advance and as, readers probably know, oil exploration and discovery of new fields in the North Sea continue. The worst scenario of oil revenue only being available for 40 years to an independent Scotland would still result in Scotland being a wealthy country – Norway has been recovering oil for about that period and is the richest country in Europe. While the report appears to concentrate solely on oil, it should be noted that oil is Britain’s biggest export. The third biggest is Scotch whisky. Revenue from oil, food and drink and other products would make Scotland the sixth richest nation on earth. Clearly when Scotland becomes independent the rump UK would lose massive revenues. I suspect from the report’s sentence “in common with all countries (the rump UK included) it [Scotland] would have to make some uncomfortable choices”. Clearly the IFS concern is only with the UK holding on to Scottish products and the UK’s loss of standing on the world stage. Bill McLean, 5 Rosemill Court, Newmills, Dunfermline. Could it be that the report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies might signal the beginning of a mature debate on the economic prospects of an independent Scotland? If so, such a departure will be most welcome. For too long the debate has been conducted at the level of a primary school playground spat. It is to be hoped the emergence of more authoritative information will allow our politicians to demonstrate they are capable of more than the infantile behaviour which in the past has characterised their day-to-day discourse. John Kelly, 65 Hunter Road, Milngavie. There is a lot of discussion at present as to whether Scotland would be better off being independent. I feel that is not the point and would instead explore the analogy of divorce. As a divorcee myself, a woman seeking a divorce is not doing so in order to be better off but in order to end a relationship. For many, this can mean financial sacrifice and difficulties but many women feel this is worthwhile to have freedom over their own destiny and live their lives as they would wish. While the analogy could be pushed too far, it is often the case that a husband and wife get on better once they are not living together. This might well happen in the case of Scotland and England. The relationship at present is a bit like when I was first married and needed my husband’s permission to have a passport, get a loan or a mortgage, and my income was taxed as his. Marriage has moved on since then and has become more equal but the relationship between Scotland and England has not, or not fast enough. I intend to vote yes to the question of Scottish independence, not because I believe Scotland will be better or worse off, but because she will have the chance to manage her own affairs as she sees fit. Ann Rayner, 22 Saughton Crescent, Edinburgh."
"Lessons from Oslo; Heather Mallick concludes her quest for good ideas in rich Norway, home to humble people who figured out how to handle oil wealth",Norway,"OSLO -- OSLO-Britain is cool, Denmark is heavenly and Norway is next. Two down and one to go in my three-nation quest to find out why Stephen Harper in 1997 sneered in a speech to Americans that ""Canada is a Northern European welfare state in the worst sense of the term, and very proud of it."" I can hold a grudge for 15 years, easy, but that isn't the point. I assumed the innocent Harper simply hadn't visited these northern nations or he'd have seen how badly we needed to nudge closer to their style, their way of thinking. Britain and Scandinavia are full of good ideas for a Canada at the crossroads, with a Conservative government trying to take us back to the 1950s while provinces like Alberta and Quebec stare at the future with a wild surmise. We should study the northern nations. We are one of them. On the other hand, Norway fills me with apprehension. Norwegians are famously rational and courteous, almost as good-looking as the Danes and rich as Croesus. Teen poet Adrian Mole once saluted the nation in a 1984 novel by Sue Townsend: ""Norway! Land of difficult spelling. Hiding your beauty behind strange vowels. Land of long days, short nights and dots over 'O's. One day I will sjourn to your shores. I live in the middle of England But! Norway! My soul resides in your watery fiords fyords fiiords Inlets."" Good Idea: Get rich, properly Norway has become stupefyingly rich, something I am accustomed to in totalitarian women-hating countries like Saudi Arabia but not in sophisticated generous nations with photogenic industries like logging and fishing. The great B.C. online magazine The Tyee ran a long - and brilliant - series by Mitchell Anderson this year on the economic glory of Norway. I urge you to read it. It shocked me to my greedy Canadian core. The Norwegians discovered offshore oil in the 1960s but, unlike Canada, learned to manage it well and now, well, they're loaded. Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund, is worth $650 billion (U.S) and will hit $1 trillion in this decade. (Alberta's Heritage Fund, set up in 1976, is at a banana republic level of $15.9 billion.) As Anderson says stolidly, that's equal to ""140 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product), or about $120,000 for every man, woman and child"" in Norway. (They have 5 million people, we have 31 million.) The fund owns 1 per cent of the world's stocks. Norway has a debt surplus. It has full employment, a phrase that in my world ranks with ""cure for cancer"" and ""climate stability."" According to the International Monetary Fund, it has the third highest per capita GDP in the world, after Luxembourg and Qatar, where you do not want to live. We're 10th. I am filled with retroactive shame for how Canada - most notably Alberta - messed up its stewardship of natural resources. It's like a lottery ticket we failed to cash. Let's look at how Norway has dealt with rapacious multinationals, mitigated environmental damage and decided to rule its own destiny, along with feeling a certain amount of guilt at its good fortune. ""We have an abundancy problem,"" says Prof. Dag Harald Claes, head of political science at the University of Oslo. ""It seems like a nice problem but it's still a problem."" There is a startling right-left political consensus in Norway, but it may be the consequence of wealth. For instance, when the so-called right-wing wants to get difficult, I am told, it argues that not enough is being spent on welfare. No one blinks. It wasn't always this way. When oil extraction began, regulation was weak, Claes says. ""The American companies came, did it the way they did it in Texas with no labour, health or environmental regulations."" Then in 1980 an offshore oil platform collapse killed 123 workers. ""The Nordic logic kicked in."" Now the industry is heavily regulated, taxed and structured for the future, the only debate being at what pace extraction should continue, to avoid the ""Dutch disease"" of an oil-dominated economy crushing manufacturing exports. Canada faces this problem in its rush to pull money out of the tarsands at full speed. It uses low-paid foreign workers, for instance. Here, local workers are trained, so that the expertise doesn't leave if a multinational departs. Einar Lie, a history professor at the University of Oslo, says the Norwegian government initially had a semi-war with multinational oil firms because it wanted control of its own resources and a marginal tax rate of at least 90 per cent. (In 2010, Alberta charged only 10-per-cent royalties on its all its oil revenue, Anderson reports.) The multinationals threatened to leave the Norwegian shelf. ""(Norway) didn't want them to leave but they didn't beg them to stay because that's not how we do things in Norwegian politics,"" Lie says. And Norway is set to double its carbon tax on offshore oil and is setting up a £1-billion fund to help repair climate change damage in the developing world. That's how they do it. That's how Alberta didn't, and doesn't, do it. Even the suggestion of confronting foreign oil companies makes timid Canadians feel faint. Norway called the multinational bluff, yet kept it civilized. ""We have a strong belief in negotiations without winners and losers,"" Lie says. ""Norway is an extremely egalitarian society."" Despite all the lectures about equality, I go to Aker Brygge, a former shipyard turned into a nest for the rich, and see evidence of astounding wealth. Here in adjacent Tjuvholmen is the Astrup Fearnley Museum designed by Renzo Piano who describes it as ""a roof with pieces under it."" Some roof. Some pieces. ""Fashionable, expensive and vacuous,"" critics have called it, a case of a gallery overwhelming its art. It's a curving glass cap over wood, containing wonderful modern Norwegian and Chinese photography that almost make up for the 1990s Damien Hirst pre-surgery genitalia et al. Oh Damien, pubic hair is so old. The rich are everywhere, in crass New York, where their homes are rendered in glass and steel, and in London, where people build three-storey basements in a studied effort to be non-ostentatious. But on the wharf I saw an apartment building whose beauty - yet palpable air of menace - made me gasp. Its roof was shaped like a Viking prow, and the ship's body rolled out over the rooftop to the fjord like some kind of threatening blast from the 11th century. The parapet proclaimed might like an aircraft carrier. For the first time in my life, I understood not the 1 per cent but the 0.01 per cent. I know that the person on the top floor thinks the way I do: ""One day the grave will claim me. Also my toe hurts."" But I felt as though I had been beaten with golf clubs. On the other hand, people describe Oslo wrongly. They tell me the university is ""out in the suburbs."" No, it's not. I say that as a Torontonian. It's in Blindern, an area easily reachable by tram with detached houses so lovely in an understated way that I feel I'm in a kind of domestic heaven. Really, I have another of my ""turns."" I walked through Blindern in a drift of autumn leaves feeling emotionally carbonated - no, it's an actual numinous northern moment - which does not happen to me at York University or anywhere near it. There are suburbs, and there are suburbs. Similarly, Oslo had Toronto's waterfront - blocked off by an expressway, ratty and ugly. It's fixing it. It's burying parts of its expressway. The new opera house is an impressively massive white iceberg sloping into the fjord. There's a clutch of skyscrapers - known accurately but not fondly as ""The Barcode"" - but it doesn't block the harbour. In Oslo, they're getting it right. Good idea: Write crime fiction Norway frightens me because I have read its novels. Nordic Noir is huge at the moment, and rightfully so. The journalist Mark Lawson, who is hosting a BBC radio series on European detective fiction, not only says that the genre offers tourism in prose form, but that it is predictive. ""It is a magnifying glass that frequently reveals the fingerprints of history before they become visible to politicians or journalists."" He's right. The late Stieg Larsson, whose first novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was originally titled Men Who Hate Women, guided us around Stockholm's killing grounds and reminded us that smart brave women like Lisbeth Salander can scarcely survive in this world. Jo Nesbo is the Norwegian novelist whose Harry Hole (Hoo-la) detective series introduced me to Oslo. Just as it's a bad idea to see the 1973 Julie Christie movie Don't Look Now before you go to Venice - you will spend your days expecting to be stabbed by people in little red coats - it's a bad idea to read Nesbo before you go to Oslo. His hero is an alcoholic loner who ferrets around in the most fetid areas of the city, places that would have slipped past me had I not read Nesbo. Blood stands out on the grey pavements of Oslo, which is far enough north that the sun on the Earth's curve this time of year is all the more blinding for being short-lived and low. There's no stigma to writing thrillers in Scandinavia, Nesbo explained to the Guardian's John Crace. ""Many Scandinavian writers who had made their name in literary fiction felt they wanted to have a go at the crime novel to show they could compete with the best. If Salman Rushdie had been Norwegian, he would definitely have written at least one thriller."" As for prefiguring events, Nesbo's 2000 novel The Redbreast was about neo-Nazis in Oslo. And then came the 2011 Oslo bombing and the slaughter on Utoya island by a Muslim-hating Nazi-admiring madman. Speaking of Nazis, Norway's greatest literary work is a huge 2009 novel/memoir by Karl Ove Knausgaard, the Nordic Proust. Its unfortunate title of Min Kamp (My Struggle) makes it awkward to read in airports so I read it before I left, 430 pages of the unedited moments of a depressive's rural adolescence, which is fine. But there are five more volumes, which is not. The critic Louis Menand says Min Kamp is about ""the adventure of the ordinary steadily retreating"" toward meaninglessness. I enjoyed Min Kamp, especially the weirdly compelling 150-page sequence about housecleaning, but have more than 3,000 pages left to read (the full Knausgaard is not yet in English). I don't doubt its genius. Yet Proust loved beauty and Knausgaard doesn't encounter it much. Min Kamp is a hard road. I cannot square this with the gentle Norway I meet. It's a puzzle. Good idea: Take the train You are spoiled for choice if you want to travel around Oslo without using your legs, so untrue of Toronto. There are plenty of cyclists but it's not the bike haven Copenhagen is, perhaps because the cold here can be cutting. There are buses, trams, trains, domestic ferries and international ferries. I spent a lot of time hanging around stations pondering which form of transit I was in the mood for. A train, then a touch of tram? A ferry, or should I just sit at the Café Renzo jamming blueberry cakes into my mouth and watching teenage boys posing on two stone breasts by the sculptor Louise Bourgeois with the nipples facing inland? Good idea: Be rational Since Harper's appearance in politics, Canadians have been imbibing the American idea that feelings are more important than thoughts, that ""truthiness"" - what you feel in your gut - wins out. The Norwegians don't do this. The reason is rooted in Norwegian history, says Prof. Lie. ""We are a small country"" - funny, the Danes phrased it this way too - ""but we are quite loud about climate change, the Nobels, about our tradition of peace. We are a very open society and we travel a lot."" Peacefully splitting from Sweden in 1905, Norway has Canadian-type industries: fish, timber, water and electricity. When European companies wanted a taste in 1910, Norway stubbornly insisted on ""concession laws"" stating that waterfalls dammed for electricity by corporations should be returned to the nation after 80 years. The European Union was most unhappy with this long-retained 1907 regulation, which was not in the spirit of European sharing. But this is the Norwegian way: self-determination. Why can't Canada do the same now? Norwegian oil regulator Rolf Wiborg told The Tyee's Anderson exasperatedly, ""Protecting the future of Canadian nature and human life, looking out for local residents, providing jobs and wealth to Canada. It can all be done, that's what we are doing here. But you've got to stop thinking like a loser!"" Norway was populated by small farms and businesses with no huge inherited-wealth class or big business as in Germany or the U.K. Fairness was thus part of tradition, with everyone having an equal say. ""If I said to you, parroting the American slogan, 'What's good for business is good for Norway,' what would people say?"" I asked Lie. He laughed. ""People would say it's obviously ridiculous."" Norway is an extremely self-confident nation, but this is built on a base of government, unions and business sitting down at the same table as equals, and talking freely. ""The quickest route to losing an election,"" Lie says, ""is to promote business or organized labour interests alone. It would be tasteless and illegitimate."" OK, then. I keep making comparisons with the Harperite American style that Canada is emulating. Lie shrugs. ""It's so different. Climate, abortion, Sarah Palin, and domestic issues like family values, obesity, big cars,"" Lie says. ""It's not nice to make fun of people. So most Norwegians feel a great distance from the Americans."" Good Idea: Be compassionate The 21-year prison sentence given to mass murderer Anders Breivik struck me as distinctly undercooked. I complained (not out loud, of course) that my Oslo hotel room was smaller than Breivik's three-room cell, and it was. He killed 77 people in a manner of extreme hideousness: he shot the wounded in the water, he tormented those he was about to kill. But we know all that. Although I feel confident he will never be released, was 21 years enough? Jo Nesbo has said, quite calmly: ""It was a one-off natural disaster perpetrated by an individual that couldn't have been predicted. It was not an important political event rooted in the foundations of our society."" Prof. Claes: ""We have a subculture on the right that we haven't taken seriously enough. But on balance, there is an individual explanation."" Prof. Lie: ""We learned that we have to improve our response time."" I take their point. Breivik was a friendless freak who was lucky enough to get a gun. Any serial killer attacking a gym, a classroom, an island, will kill more people than in an open space. That doesn't make him more significant than any other murderer. Why should Norway change itself to bend to the Breiviks? When I press Lie, he says Norwegians ""have a lower level of aggression in public debate."" The police report pointed out deficiencies that will be repaired, he said. He then begins to talk about a 1994 murder case in Trondheim, in which a young girl was found tortured to death and naked in the snow. To an astonishing degree, the circumstances mirrored the killing of tiny Jamie Bulger by two young boys in Liverpool in 1993. A British tabloid reporter came to interview him about the case. Lie recalls that there were very few details released to the public and very little press interest. ""She became upset with me,"" Lie recalls, bemused. She could not understand why Norwegians weren't obsessed with the case. But, he explains, they simply felt that police and social services would deal with the case appropriately, so there was nothing more to say. I wrestle with this. The murdered girl's mother and brother have since encountered her killers in town, to their shock and revulsion. Yet the mother concludes, ""The system we have in Norway is still best."" I remain as bewildered as the British reporter, because in Canada ""the system"" is poor. The local police are out of control, the RCMP is a nest for scandal and social services are exhausted. ""We have faith in our institutions,"" Lie explains. What's that like, I wonder. But my anger at Breivik's sentence is tempered by his hilarious complaints this month about the brutality meted out to him in his three-room cell. His prison pen is too bendy! It's ""an almost indescribable manifestation of sadism."" He lacks adequate moisturizer! His coffee is cold! The butter on his bread is skimpy! I change my mind. Every aspect of Breivik's existence is clearly a torment to him. May it long continue. Good ideas: In summary So my tour of the Northern European nations that Harper so despised has ended. These countries were splendid. Harper was, and is, flat-out wrong. There are dozens of good ideas here for Canadians to emulate. ""I love Canada,"" Rolf Wiborg has said. ""I love Canadians. It's a fantastic country. But in my opinion it's totally mismanaged, and by design."" To sum up: Be disrespectful like Brits. Have a bit of a laugh. Be gorgeous like Danes. Get some exercise. Be tough like Norwegians. Get rich but remain humble. These are words to live by.

Nation deserves a future free from EU meddling; Letters,Norway,"WHY are Mr Salmond and his party so desperate to remain in the EU when the country he uses as a paradigm for the benefits that independence will bring is happy to trade with the EU but rejects the baggage, costs and interference that membership brings? As with Norway, Scotland has no need of Brussels. Oil and gas reserves in abundance. Fishing grounds for the use of our own fishermen and quotas set by Edinburgh. Thriving whisky exports. A vibrant tourist trade. Our heavy industries may have diminished but light industry and electronics are more than taking up the slack. Whilst I would not like to see the break-up of the Union the prospects of a future free of meddling Eurocrats becomes increasingly irresistible. Westminster and Brussels v Edinburgh would be a real choice for 2014. SL Ingleby, Glasgow"
Hostage raid led by bandit who abducted Canadian diplomats,Norway,"JOHANNESBURG -- He was dubbed “The Uncatchable.” The RCMP tried to catch him anyway, determined to arrest him for kidnapping two Canadian diplomats and holding them for 130 days in the Sahara desert. The hunt failed – and now the target, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, is reportedly the mastermind behind a dramatic Algerian hostage-taking raid that reveals the regional perils of the French-led military offensive in Mali. About 20 armed Islamist radicals killed a Briton and an Algerian at a natural-gas complex in Algeria Wednesday morning. They injured six others and captured dozens of hostages, including citizens of the U.S., Britain, France, Norway, Ireland and Japan. The attackers, claiming they have seven Americans and 34 other hostages, demanded a halt to the French military operation against Islamist insurgents in neighbouring Mali. The Algerian army surrounded the complex in the Amenas gas field, about 1,300 kilometres southeast of Algiers, leaving no obvious way for the kidnappers to escape in their four-wheel-drive vehicles with their hostages. No Canadians are believed to be among the hostages. One employed at the facility was said by his employer to be safe. There's no shortage of Canadians doing business in Algeria. In 2011, the country was Canada's largest African trading partner, led by companies such as SNC Lavalin and Talisman Energy. The daring raid by the Islamist fighters, who have links to al-Qaeda, showed the risks of the widening war in Mali – a war in which Canada and many other countries are contributing equipment or troops to the French-led offensive against the insurgents, who captured the northern two-thirds of the West African country last April. A group calling itself Those Who Signed in Blood claimed responsibility for the attack at the gas field near the Libyan border, owned by British company BP, Norwegian company Statoil and an Algerian state company. The hostage-takers are reportedly armed with light and heavy weapons, including mortars and anti-aircraft guns. The attackers are said to be an affiliate of the Masked Brigade, founded by Mr. Belmokhtar last year after he quit another radical group, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which has collected tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments for dozens of hostages over the past decade. Robert Fowler, the veteran Canadian diplomat who was abducted by Mr. Belmokhtar's militia in 2008, remembers him as the tough and revered leader of the AQIM kidnapping gang: a one-eyed, bearded man with black, curly hair and a scarred face who was deeply committed to a jihad against the West. He had a commanding presence in a zealous organization that was determined to impose a religious regime over as much territory as possible, Mr. Fowler said in an interview. “He's not a big man, he's not a strong man, but he was absolutely the undisputed leader,” Mr. Fowler said. “They hate states. It's all about God's dominion on Earth. They don't want a country. They want the world. They want the world to be ruled by God through the strict and uncompromising application of sharia [Islamic law].” After he and fellow diplomat Louis Guay were released by the kidnappers in April, 2009, Mr. Fowler was repeatedly questioned by RCMP agents, who were trying to build a criminal case against Mr. Belmokhtar by gathering forensic evidence from the former hostages. But the RCMP investigation had little chance of success. “I don't think he's going to be in Kingston Pen,” Mr. Fowler said. Mr. Belmokhtar, believed to be in his early 40s, is a veteran Algerian-born militant who served in an Afghanistan training camp during the Soviet occupation. Later, in addition to his kidnapping escapades, he orchestrated a vast smuggling network that generated millions of dollars from the trafficking of drugs, cigarettes and stolen cars across the Sahara. He crossed the border easily between the deserts of northern Mali and Algeria. Calgary-based Talisman Energy, which has interests in oil fields a few hundred kilometres from the site of Wednesday's hostage-taking, has imposed a ban on Algerian travel for its employees. “As of today, we've placed a temporary travel ban on Talisman staff or contractors going into Algeria. But we will continuously review the situation,” spokeswoman Phoebe Buckland said. In 2008, a dozen SNC-Lavalin employees were killed, and another 15 injured, when a car bomb went off near a bus transporting them to a water-treatment plant southeast of Algiers. In 2009, SNC-Lavalin landed an Algerian contract to build an 80,000-person city from scratch. And late last year, a team including Montreal-based Lemay Architects was selected to design a $2.4-billion city near the ancient city of Constantine. The project will likely last a decade, chief creative officer Michel Lauzon said. Lemay has had an office and several staff members in Algiers for the past couple of years. “Safety in Algeria is not much of an issue,” he said. “I'm not really worried, travelling there. People are very friendly, very open, very agreeable and very hospitable.” As a board member at First Calgary Petroleum, Darryl Raymaker oversaw dozens of employees based in Algeria's oil-field city of Hassi Messaoud. “We never really encountered any hostilities whatsoever,” he said. If anything, while he was working in and around Algiers – between 2000 and 2007 – tourist kidnappings in the west of the country were more of a danger than attacks on oil workers in the east. “There were al-Qaeda elements there. On the other hand, the government really dealt with them very, very firmly and with great persistence. … There was the odd incident, I would have to say that, but it was not an endemic kind of thing.”"
DRUGS GIANT SETS SIGHTS ON SHIRE; MARKET REPORT,Norway,"JUST like westerns, the old ones are always the best. Hyperactive punters injected life into Shire amid revived hopes that the UK's third largest drugs group's days of independence are numbered. They chased the shares up to 2092p before they closed 49p higher at 2082p on revived gossip of a £30-a-share cash bid from AstraZeneca, 4.5p easier at 3037p. Turnover swelled to 47m. AstraZeneca began the year as the big pharmaceutical group with the most to prove. Tuesday's news of a major senior management shake-out by new chief executive Pascal Soriot increased speculation that the high level reorganisation, which saw the departure of research and development chief Martin Mackay and head commercial boss Tony Zook, could be the precursor to a game-changing deal. AstraZeneca has often been mentioned in the same breath as Shire, which recently projected 'sound' growth for 2013 and wheeled out the acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair, which has been hard at work on a new therapy for a rare skin disease. When Soriot arrived at AZ and immediately put the kibosh on share buy-backs, speculation was rife that he wanted to conserve cash and build a war chest to make a transformational acquisition. To some people in the market, Shire is a no brainer. It is one of the first pharmaceutical companies to enter the Regenerative Medicine field in a meaningful way. Tui Travel touched 304.9p before closing 11.1p higher at 292.5p on confirmation of a merger approach from German 56.4pc shareholder Tui AG. A deal to combine the German travel and tourism group with its majority-owned UK business to cut costs has always been on the cards and dealers are just flabbergasted that it has taken so long for the talks to get started. The Nikkei's biggest loss overnight for eight months on profit-taking set the stage for an easier trend in London. The Footsie drifted 13.33 points lower to 6103.98, while the FTSE 250 eased 11.15 points to 12,763.64. Wall Street lost 23.66 points to 13511.23 despite nearly-tripled fourth-quarter earnings from Goldman Sachs and better-than-expected earnings from the biggest US bank, JP Morgan Chase. Mining giant Anglo American collapsed to 1857.5p before closing 60p lower at 1901p after a number of its workers protested against plans to close several mines in South Africa. The employees refused to enter several mines owned by subsidiary Amplats, or Anglo American Platinum. Their refusal followed Amplats' decision to reduce output by 400,000 ounces per annum after putting four unsustainable, high-cost shafts at Rustenburg on long-term care and maintenance. Mobile phone giant Vodafone lost 3p to 169p after Deutsche Bank downgraded to hold from buy and slashed its target price to 175p from 225p. Diageo slumped to 1762.52p after SocGen downgraded to hold from buy and cut its target price to 1900p from 2050p. Yet the close was 4p better at 1806p. Private equity takeover talk helped United Utilities climb 14.5p to 712p. Global engineering group Rolls-Royce jumped 15.5p to 912p after announcing a £46m contract to supply PetroChina with equipment and related services to power the flow of natural gas through Line 3 of the West-East Pipeline Project, the world's longest pipeline. Sold down to 25.5p amid continuing gossip that today's Christmas trading statement will disappoint - and could even contain a profits warning - Dixons Retail recovered to finish 0.08p off at 27.11p. Argos owner Home Retail, which also reports the all-important third-quarter sales figures today, cheapened 1.3p to 121.5p. Despite an RBC Capital Markets recommendation and increased target price of 2400p, up from 1850p, pumps giant Weir Group eased a penny to 1948p. The broker says Weir's end-market exposure offers potential for structural growth medium term and its historical above-average return on sales and invested capital are sustainable. Independent oil and gas company Faroe Petroleum cheapened 2p to 132.75p after issuing an operational update and said that it had been awarded eight new exploration licences in Norway. Oriel Securities said Faroe's 2013 exploration programme remains one of the most attractive in the secondary oils sector. Forbidden Technologies rose 2.5p to 23p after the developer of the market-leading Cloud video platform, FORscene, announced it enjoyed a strong performance in 2012, with revenue growth expected to exceed analysts' forecasts. © Daily Mail"
DESERT BLOODBATH,Norway,"When Islamist terrorists seized a gas installation in the Sahara, the Algerian government refused to negotiate. After the siege ended yesterday, at least 23 hostages — and 32 militants — lay dead As Islamic militants seized control of a natural gas production complex deep in the Sahara desert on Wednesday morning, an Algerian employed in the canteen heard some of the gunmen remonstrating with a British worker. ""They threatened him,"" the Algerian said later. ""They threatened him until he called out in English to his friends, telling them, 'Come out, come out, they're not going to kill you. They're looking for the Americans.' A few minutes later they blew him away."" Tales of savage cruelty are being told by survivors of one of the biggest and most complex international hostage crises in decades. There were reports of Islamists executing hostages with a bullet to the head or the back. Gunmen strapped explosives to other hostages with threats to blow them up if the army attacked. A Japanese witness yesterday described seeing 10 blackened bodies at the local hospital, apparently victims of a fire or explosion after an Algerian helicopter gunship had strafed a convoy of jeeps containing hostages and their kidnappers on Thursday. Mohamed, 37, a nurse, said at least five people were shot dead, their bodies still in front of the infirmary when he left on Thursday night. There were also tales of extraordinary courage: it has emerged that amid the shock and terror, local workers at the plant helped to hide several foreigners and facilitated their escape by pretending they were Algerians. Yesterday the siege ended — as it had begun — in bloodshed. The seven remaining hostages were reported by Algeria to have been murdered by their captors, who had holed up in a machine room and had also booby-trapped part of the complex with explosives. The 11 Islamists, linked to Al-Qaeda, were said to have been killed in a ""final assault"" launched by the Algerians after a fire broke out at the sprawling complex, run jointly by BP and the state oil companies of Norway and Algeria. The total number of terrorists killed is believed to be 29. Algerian forces were said to have found 15 burnt bodies at the plant. Efforts were under way to identify them and it was not clear how they had died. Before the final assault yesterday 16 foreigners — including two British nationals, two Americans, two Germans and one Portuguese — were freed. The government said yesterday that one Briton was dead and five were unaccounted for. BP's group chief executive, Bob Dudley, speaking for the first time about the attack, said that while 14 out of 18 BP staff who were on the gas site were now safe, BP had ""grave fears"" that the remaining four were likely to be dead. While the drama at the gas plant is over, the West's problems in the Sahara may have only just begun. The attack on the complex followed France's military intervention against Islamists in Mali. It was a reminder of how the hatred of the West inspired by Osama bin Laden, the 9/11 mastermind, has survived his death at the hands of US troops in Pakistan in May 2011. It has thrust Al-Qaeda militancy in the Sahara to the top of the global agenda. Western leaders, from David Cameron to Barack Obama, now have to make hard assessments about how far to shift the focus of the war on terror from Pakistan and Afghanistan, where drone strikes against militant leaders have eroded the terror network, to the jihadists' African stomping ground. Cameron seethed last week at being kept in the dark by an oppressive Algerian regime as the hostage crisis unfolded. He was furious not to have been warned that Algerian troops were to launch an assault on the kidnappers. There were questions, too, about how the Islamists could have so easily gained access to such a heavily guarded plant. As hundreds of foreign oil workers were transferred from Algeria, doubts grew about whether they would ever return: the Sahara, according to some experts, is on the verge of becoming a terrorist haven like Afghanistan before the 2001 terror attacks — but with only the Mediterranean separating it from Europe. THE pay — often more than £100,000 ($120,000) a year taxfree — is good, but beyond the occasional volleyball tournament and Norwegian waffle party, life for foreigners at the In Amenas gas plant 800 miles southeast of Algiers, the Algerian capital, can hardly be described as fun. The rows of prefabricated dwellings deep in the Sahara look like a prison camp or army barracks. There is an indoor swimming pool and a football pitch. In the summer the heat can become intolerable and the place is regularly engulfed by sandstorms and swarms of locusts. Veterans tap their shoes before putting them on in the morning for fear of being bitten by scorpions. That is as nothing compared with what the hostages had to put up with last week as they found themselves trapped between heavily armed jihadists determined to strike a blow for Al-Qaeda and Algerian soldiers equally determined not to negotiate or let any escape. The trouble has its roots in a bloody insurrection by Islamist groups that was fiercely repressed by the Algerian government in the 1990s with the loss of 150,000 lives. Afterwards the Islamists did not give up; many joined bin Laden's ranks in Afghanistan. Today they have established themselves in a vast desert territory rich in uranium and other minerals that spans several northern African countries whose borders they do not recognise. The most active group is known as al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim). This is an alliance of smugglers and jihadists who have raised millions of dollars in ransom by kidnapping dozens of foreigners — and beheading some of them — in Niger and Mali, including workers at a uranium mine operated by France's Areva nuclear company. With the help of weapons looted from the remnants of the Libyan regime, Aqim has grown increasingly powerful in recent months, taking over a swathe of Mali bigger than Germany and imposing its brutal law of beatings and amputations. Until now the only thing preventing these ""soldier monks"" from seizing gas workers in Algeria, another former French colony, were elaborate security measures including armed escorts for the buses that carried foreigners in and out of the plant and a series of army checkpoints on roads leading up to the complex. The perimeter fence is patrolled every night by armed guards. How the kidnappers broke through this ring of steel is not yet certain, although there may be evidence of help from inside. It is certainly clear that the raid was planned long in advance and was commanded — from a distance — by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian militant whose nicknames, ""Mr Marlboro"" and ""One Eye"", refer to his prowess at cigarette smuggling and an injury sustained from shrapnel in Afghanistan. He is reported to have broken away recently from Aqim after arguing about tactics with a rival militant leader and has set up his own group, Continued on page 12 W W REPORTING TEAM Mark Hookham, Matthew Campbell, Isabel Oakeshott, David Leppard, Richard Kerbaj, Georgia Graham, Robin Henry and Lucy Fisher 'I fled with explosives around my neck' - survivors tell their tales Stephen McFaul, 36, fled to safety with explosives tied around his neck. The Irish national from Belfast texted his wife ""I'm free, I'm free!"" after escaping when the vehicle he was travelling in crashed after coming under fire from Algerian forces. Hours earlier he had told his relatives ""al-Qaeda have got me"". He said many of the captives in the other 4x4s were probably killed. Engineer David Murray, 47, from Kirkby, Merseyside, called his family late on Friday night to give them the news: ""I'm safe — I'm coming home."" His family say he made a daring bid for freedom with his colleagues, fleeing to an army checkpoint where they were taken in by troops. Murray has spent more than seven years as a lead engineer at the gas plant at In Amenas. Darren Matthews, 29, from Cleveland, a BP engineer specialising in hazardous area inspections, is believed to have been rescued as Algerian forces stormed the oil plant on Friday. Matthews, who became a father just before Christmas, said: ""At the end of the day, it's only work. No one should have to go through [this]."" He added: ""I won't feel 100% happy until I am back in the UK."" Released on Thursday, Alan Wright, 37, told The Sunday Times he had stayed in one place while being held hostage, waiting 30 hours before Algerian forces came to his rescue. The father of two was met by his wife at Heathrow and they returned to their home in Aberdeen together last night. He was first debriefed by government officials in London. Mark Grant, 29, spoke to his wife, Emma, shortly after militants stormed the In Amenas plant on Wednesday, but it was only 36 agonising hours later that she received a text from him that read: ""I'm safe."" The project services contracts administrator from Grangemouth, Falkirk, took up his job in Algeria 18 months ago. He was on his way home last night to his wife and one-year-old daughter. Engineer Iain Strachan, 38, was the first Briton to be interviewed. After leaving the gas plant he told Algerian TV on Friday that the country's army was ""fantastic"". The father of two from Howwood, in Renfrewshire, said: ""I've never been so relieved as when they came and got us off site."" Despite his joy at being freed he said his thoughts were with colleagues that had not managed to escape. WHEN fanatics with links to al-Qaeda attacked the BP plant, it was the first time that many people around the world had heard of the Islamist organisation with the acronym Aqim. The full name of the loose confederation of extremist militants is al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb — Maghreb is an old name for north Africa west of Egypt — and its roots lie in Algeria in the late 1990s. Today the organisation is anchored primarily in Algeria and northern Mali, but also operates throughout north and northwest Africa in Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Tunisia and Libya. Unlike its mother organisation, founded by Osama bin Laden to inspire global jihad and create a worldwide ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate, Aqim began as a localised nationalist group. It was formed under the name of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat in 1999 by disgruntled Islamist rebels who did not support the agreements to end Algeria's bloody civil war. Salafist jihadists are fundamentalists who oppose any change to the original scriptures of Islam. Unwilling to lay down their guns and sign the peace accord with other Islamist fighters, these hardline rebels began a nationalist insurgency group with the aim of overthrowing the Algerian government. It was only when the group's efforts started to flag in the mid-2000s that they alighted upon the idea of allying themselves with al-Qaeda and extending their horizons beyond Algeria and its immediate surroundings. Short of funding and in need of advice, Abdelmalek Droukdal, the group's leader and a resourceful maths graduate, sent a secret missive to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the warlord leader of al-Qaeda's Iraq-based affiliate. By 2007 it had received al-Qaeda's blessing and was welcomed as part of its worldwide franchise. Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was born. Aqim's influence in the region has spread considerably since its rebranding. In March 2012 the Algerian Islamists joined forces with Tuareg rebels and other extremists to storm the northern half of Mali. The organisation has also exploited the chaos in Libya and Tunisia following the ousting of their respective leaders, Muammar Gadaffi and Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, in 2011. In the meantime Aqim cells have also sprung up in Mauritania to target the many western tourists who visit the country. More recently Aqim has collaborated with Boko Haram, an extremist group based in northern Nigeria. Carter Ham, the leading US general in Africa, confirmed last month that Aqim was funding the group and training its members in camps in Mali. Western security forces understand that Aqim has also given Boko Haram a £170,000 donation. With its influence already wide and continuing to grow, Aqim has inspired new Islamist extremist groups emerging throughout the region and has also persuaded existing groups to affiliate with it. Part of the key to its success is that it allows the groups to retain their local identities. But the al-Qaeda movement in north Africa is far from united. Splinter groups have already broken away from it, most notably the so-called Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, which grouped last year. Its recruits consider Aqim's ambitions too limited and want to spread jihad throughout west Africa. The organisation has also been weakened by rivalries in its leadership between Droukdal and Mokhtar Belmokhtar — a one-eyed veteran jihadist and kidnapper, as well as a smuggler of arms, cigarettes and drugs, who masterminded last week's attack. The various local groupings that make up Aqim and associate with it span the entire Sahara and Sahel regions — the Sahel is a semi-arid zone stretching the width of north Africa south of the Sahara. So the groups can move easily across the porous borders of north Africa. They are difficult to monitor and present an even greater challenge for national security forces to defeat. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a think tank at Stanford University in California, said Aqim's involvement in the Algerian hostage taking and also the Malian national crisis ""underscores that we are dealing with a diffuse, resilient and extremely dangerous regional threat capable of spreading and taking over whole countries"". The group certainly has the funds to organise large-scale coups. It is flush with cash from its various smuggling operations. Its greatest source of revenue appears to be hostage taking and the lucrative ransoms paid. Experts at the US Treasury estimate that Maghrebi terrorists have made more than £57m from kidnappings in the past 10 years. Hostages are normally ""sold"" back to their home countries for an average of £2m a head. Although the group has carried out kidnappings since 2003, it has increasingly targeted westerners since 2007. In the past six months five humanitarian workers have been seized in Niger and a French tourist has been abducted in Mali. Britons have also been taken. Edwin Dyer, a British tourist attending a Tuareg cultural festival in Timbuktu, was kidnapped and executed by Aqim in Mali in 2009. According to some unconfirmed reports he was beheaded Britain is one of only a handful of countries, including the United States and Algeria, that have publicly declared they will not pay ransoms. The extent of Aqim's commercial enterprises means some analysts consider it to be more a criminal gang rather than a group of ideological extremists. The organisation generally appears to be concerned more with regional issues than ""global jihad"", the founding mission of al-Qaeda proper. Either way, as last week's events have shown, the agile and well-funded terrorist organisation presents a severe threat to international security. Richard Barrett, an expert on al-Qaeda with the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism in the Hague, believes Aqim's influence on Africa will increase rapidly. As the group's profile has grown, so it has become a ""magnet for fighters from all over northern Africa: Senegal, Chad, Ivory Coast"". The French mission in Mali will be watched closely by its allies and is seen as a litmus test for armed international intervention in the Maghreb. Barrett predicts the attack on UK and American nationals by Aqim-affiliates in Algeria is likely to drag the two countries into military operations in the Maghreb. Nick Butler, former head of strategy at BP, warned last week that companies ""can't operate in areas that are lawless"" and described a ""crescent of difficulty"" around the coastline of north Africa. He added that the risks were higher for western companies and therefore ""they will be looking for concerted action of which they can be part to make sure these are still places in which they can work"". Whatever the companies decide there seems little doubt that the events in Algeria and Mali herald a new front in the global war on terror. From desert rats to al-Qaeda's right hand in Africa"
"Algeria hostage crisis: al Qaeda had help from inside claim security sources; Up to five of the al Qaeda-linked Islamists who carried out the most spectacular and bloody hostage in recent years were employees of the gas plant, security sources have revealed.",Norway,"One of those involved in the ""inside job"" was of French nationality, the sources told the Daily Telegraph, in what appears to be a blow to those in charge of safety at the highly strategic In Amenas plant, which accounts for 12 per cent of Algeria's[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/algeria] gas production. The unnamed French accomplice is said to have changed sides once his comrades in arms had broken into the desert site in southeastern Algeria after attacking bus at a false checkpoint. He then took part in the kidnapping operation before being killed during the Algerian army assault on the site. Some terrorists are reported to have known internal procedures at the plant as well as the room numbers of expatriates. Gendarmes are understood to have opened an investigation into four other workers who survived the attack on suspicion of helping the kidnappers enter the tightly-guarded facility, the sources said, without providing further details. In a further development, up to five of the hostage takers are believed to have been captured alive, separate sources said. The Algerian government earlier said that all 32 kidnappers had been ""neutralised"", leaving open the possibility that not all were dead. ""One gave himself up after running out of munitions, while two more were picked up by Algerian special forces after being injured,"" one local security source told The Daily Telegraph. With the military operation over, forensic scientists from Algeria's national gendarmerie arrived yesterday to begin the macabre task of identifying the bodies. Civil protection workers said they had spent Sunday retrieving a gruesome list of body parts – ""fingers, hands, feet, legs"" – as they sought to piece together who had been killed in a deadly mix of machine gunfire, terrorist explosions and helicopter gunship attacks. Security services said 25 further bodies were recovered yesterday, with differing reports over how many were hostages. Citing security sources, Anis Rahmani of private television channel Ennahar said all 25 were captives, but The Daily Telegraph was told that 15 of their number were militants. Either way, Algerian communications minister Mohamed Said made it clear that earlier provisional figures for the number of dead – 23 hostages and 32 kidnappers – would likely have to be ""revised upward"". A civil protection source said that the overall death toll, including kidnappers and hostages was between 55 and 60, with roughly half foreign hostages. William Hague, the foreign secretary, said yesterday that some of those hostages are likely to have been executed. ""That sort of thing is quite likely to have happened,"" he said. Last night, bomb squads were still combing the area for explosive devices, with the army saying the kidnappers had placed mines beneath the sand around the factory to hinder the army's advance, but also inside the plant. Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company running the Ain Amenas site along with BP and Norway's Statoil, confirmed the entire refinery had been mined. ""They had decided to succeed in the operation as planned, to blow up the gas complex and kill all the hostages,"" said communications minister Mohamed Said. The revelation though of the possibility of an 'inside job"" follows expressions of surprise by security experts at the apparent ease with which the terrorists loyal to Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the one-eyed Islamist who formed his own brigade, the ""Signatories in Blood"", penetrated the plant. It was the first successful terrorist attack against a petrol or gas plant in Algeria. ""These installations are highly protected. The operation must have been prepared over quite some time. Either there was a slip up or it was internal complicity,"" said Louis Caprioli, adviser at GEOs, the risk management group and a former domestic intelligence agent. A spokesman for BP refused to be drawn on the possible security beach: ""We wouldn't comment on this,"" he said. Last night it was confirmed that the apparent leader of the militants, Abdul Rahman al-Nigeri, was ready at any time to blow up the hostages. Another of the kidnappers was identified as Abdallahi Ould Hmida. An al Qaeda veteran of 14 years loyal to Belmokhtar, he played a role in the assassination of French tourists in Mauritania in 2010, earning himself the nickname of the ""Mauritanian Zarkaoui"". Yesterday, the local population in In Amenas was in a state of total shock. ""This is the first time we have heard the name of our town in the mouths of David Cameron and Barack Obama. We are furious about this terrorist strike,"" one local The Daily Telegraph. The army yesterday had erected a roadblock some 16km from the gas plant, with no journalists or photographers allowed near the site. With huge question marks over the details of the operation and the number of deaths, the Algerian prime minister has pledged to hold a press conference in the town to clarify the situation."
Crisis threatens Algeria's future growth,Norway,"Algeria's rulers have been sitting pretty for years on an ocean of oil and gas, raking in billions in cash that helped buy off the country's restless youth and mask the social inequality, mismanagement and corruption that has felled other governments across the region. But the dramatic hostage crisis at the southern In Amenas gasfield, in which dozens of Islamists and hostages were killed in a still murky stand-off and subsequent government raid, has dredged up old ghosts and threatened to undermine economic growth prospects . ""The economy is the Algerians' biggest fear at this point,"" a US energy industry executive now working in Algeria said in a telephone interview. ""I've heard from many of my Algerian friends and clients about the international hit to the reputation of Algeria this will cause. They have lived in relative peace for over a decade and they fear this event will plunge them back into the civil war that decimated the country through the 90s."" The government and its supporters have tried to put a positive spin on the attack and its aftermath. The former director-general of Sonatrach, Abdelmajid Attar, told the daily El Khabar newspaper that losses caused by the attack would be ""marginal"" and that BP, which operated the site alongside Norway's Statoil, would soon get the plant up and running. Even during the civil war of the 1990s, more than 40 energy companies operated in Algeria, doubling the country's petroleum output, he noted. Far from the country's densely populated coast, the attack had little impact on most Algerians' day-to-day lives. But it is likely to have been fears for the economy that provoked what many describe as Algeria's heavy-handed response to the hostage-taking, especially amid rumours that the militants had been threatening to blow up the gasfield. Algeria has been a consistent supplier of energy to the west since the 1960s, never allowing wars, political disagreements or trade disputes to halt the flow of oil and gas. ""To be reliable source of gas is a linchpin of Algerian policy,"" said Frances Ghiles, a north Africa specialist at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs. ""The idea that supply could be cut is anathema to the Algerian leadership. Trying to blow up a gasfield may have motivated the brutality."" The In Amenas complex supplies about 2 per cent of Europe's gas imports. It produces 6 billion cubic metres a year - about 15 per cent of the country's output. An official at the country's state-owned oil company told a local newspaper the four-day crisis had already cost more than $40m in lost gas revenues. Insurance and security costs for both Algerian and international firms doing business in the country will inevitably rise, experts predicted in the local media. Already BP and Conoco have pulled all non-essential personnel out of the country. ""The brazen attack on the gas plant will reverberate for many years,"" said the energy company executive, who has been travelling to Algeria since the early 2000s. ""Not sure how many of our partners will be willing to come back after this attack."" The hostage drama also threatens to derail plans to build on the energy sector to create a healthier and more diverse economy. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's administration is rolling out an ambitious $261bn investment plan employing foreign and local contractors to upgrade Algerian education, healthcare, drinking water, recreational facilities, roads, rails, ports and farmlands that were neglected during the dark years of the country's civil war. ""The attack means that investors that have a greater appetite for risk will be willing to stay and up security, even if the cost of operations and expanded operations will increase,"" said Anthony Skinner, a Middle East and north Africa specialist at Maplecroft, a UK risk-management consultancy. ""But if you have companies that are not willing to invest in security or not going to invest. If you're dealing with consumer goods, tourism, etc., they're not going to invest.""

Algerians Find Many More Dead At Hostage Site,Norway,"BAMAKO, Mali -- Algerian officials said Sunday that security forces combing the scene of a bloody four-day hostage siege had discovered many more corpses, some badly burned, at a gas-production complex deep in the Sahara. They also said for the first time that some of the hostage takers were captured alive. ''There are a good 20 bodies,'' a senior Algerian official said of the grim discoveries at the site on Sunday, a day after a final assault ended the siege. ''These must be identified.'' Once they are, the preliminary count of 23 dead hostages seemed certain to rise, officials acknowledged. ''I'm very afraid that the numbers are going to go up,'' the Algerian communications minister, Mohamed Saïd Oublaïd, told France 24 Television. The standoff between several dozen radical Islamists and Algerian security services came to a bloody conclusion on Saturday when the Algerians assaulted the kidnappers' last redoubt at the facility, where hundreds of Algerian and scores of expatriate workers were employed. The victims -- from the United States, Britain, France, Japan and other countries -- were killed after hours of harrowing captivity in which some were forced to wear explosives. An unknown number of the hostages died in the assault on Saturday; Algerian officials said they also killed most of the remaining hostage takers, who they said were followers of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a warlord linked to Al Qaeda based in northern Mali. A regional Web site reported that he had issued a video claiming responsibility for the attack. Specifics on exactly who was held hostage, who escaped and who was killed remained patchy and contradictory on Sunday, including the number and status of Americans caught up in the events. One senior American official said that as many as 10 American hostages who were seized at the remote gas field may have died, including one identified as dead by the State Department on Friday. But another American official said that some Americans who were at the site survived. An official with BP, one of the companies operating the complex, identified one surviving American, and the office of a Texas congressman said there was another. A senior Algerian official interviewed on Sunday declared that ''seven Americans were liberated.'' In Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron also revised earlier estimates of fatalities, saying Sunday that three British citizens were confirmed dead and three more were believed to have been killed, along with one resident of Britain who was not a citizen. Earlier, the government had said five Britons and one British resident had died or were unaccounted for. The confusion over the count of victims reflected the murky circumstances at the gas field, near a remote town in southeastern Algeria called In Amenas. Senior Algerian officials, hundreds of miles away in Algiers, the capital, said they were in the dark themselves about some aspects of the events. They may learn more from the surviving attackers -- Algerian media reports cited by The Associated Press said there were five -- that the Algerian authorities said had been captured. Officials said that security forces were scouring the complex on Sunday, looking for booby traps and mines the attackers might have planted, as well as anyone who might still be in hiding. Officials have said that 32 attackers were known to have been killed over the four days. Official declarations from the Algerian authorities have been sparse. The country's president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has hardly spoken about the crisis, even as foreign leaders have demanded details. While the Algerians have weathered criticism from British, Japanese and other foreign officials over their no-holds-barred handling of the crisis -- typical of their approach to a decades-old terrorism problem in Algeria -- other foreigners have spoken up to defend it, especially in France, the former colonial power. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said in a radio interview on Sunday that he was ''shocked'' that Algeria has been criticized for its response to terrorists who ''pillage, rape and ransack.'' He said ''there can be no impunity for terrorists'' and that efforts to combat them ''must be relentless.'' The death toll at the gas field was ''very high,'' he said, but the Algerian authorities faced an ''intolerable situation'' there, Mr. Fabius said. Algerian officials said from the outset that any sort of negotiation with the kidnappers was out of the question. Their response with overwhelming force -- including missile-firing helicopters -- was in character with the brutal 10-year war Algeria waged against Islamist insurgents in the 1990s, when tens of thousands of people died. Mr. Belmokhtar, the leader of the group that apparently staged the gas-field attack, is himself a veteran of that war. A former BP executive, who knows In Amenas and the North African oil business well, said in an interview that Mr. Belmokhtar had been on the industry's radar as a potential threat for a decade or more. The executive said Mr. Belmokhtar, though not a member of the Tuareg ethnic group himself, often used the desert tracks that the Tuaregs use to roam among the remote desert areas of Libya, Mali, Niger and Algeria. Some of those routes pass near In Amenas. The scale of the operation, which supplies about 5 percent of Algeria's gas output, and its remote location near the Libyan border meant that it was standard procedure for military escorts to accompany workers on every journey to or from distant wells, the airport or the town of In Amenas, the former executive said. He described the town as a base for the regional operations of the energy companies that operate the gas field -- BP, Statoil of Norway and Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company -- as well as oil-services companies like Halliburton, Schlumberger and JGC, the Japanese company that had employees among the hostages. Mr. Belmokhtar is believed to have been involved in a series of kidnappings of European tourists for ransom in 2003, but obtaining money does not seem to have been the main purpose of the gas field raid; rather, he reportedly claimed a political motive. ''We in Al Qaeda announce this blessed operation,'' Mr. Belmokhtar says in the video he issued on Sunday, according to Sahara Media, a regional Web site that sometimes receives communications from radical Islamists in North Africa. Sahara Media quoted from the video in its report, but did not immediately post the video. The Web site said Mr. Belmokhtar offered to negotiate with ''the West and the Algerian government, provided they stop their bombing of Mali's Muslims'' -- a reference to the French-led military intervention in Mali. The statement was dismissed by Algerian authorities on Sunday. Even so, it was another signal that the events at the gas field were linked in some way to those in Mali. French forces have stepped in there to assist the Malian Army and other African troops as they try to roll back the advance of radical Islamists who have carved out a ministate in the north. That campaign is preceding largely through airstrikes against columns of Islamist pickup trucks; French television showed images on Sunday of incinerated vehicles in Diabaly, a town that was overrun and then abandoned by the jihadists after French strikes throughout the week. French officials aid the main task for now was to stabilize central Mali and ensure that there was no further attempt by the Islamist rebels to move south toward the capital, Bamako."
WSJ BLOG/Canada Real Time: Native Prosperity Tops Canada's Arctic Council Agenda,Norway,"(This story has been posted on The Wall Street Journal Online's Canada Real Time blog at http://blogs.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/canadarealtime[http://blogs.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/canadarealtime].)      By Alistair MacDonald Energy and mining powerhouse Canada is placing something other than resources at the top of the agenda it will push as upcoming chair of the Arctic Council: the region's native people. Canada takes over the chairmanship of the eight-member Arctic Council in May. On Monday, Leona Aglukkaq, minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, sketched out Canada's plans. ""The well-being and prosperity of people living in the North must be at the forefront of Canada's Arctic Council priorities,"" Ms. Aglukkaq said at a meeting of the council in Norway. That does involve resource development, which has become a bigger issue as evidence mounts that warming temperatures are melting the region's ice, potentially making resource exploitation and shipping easier there. ""Canada is determined to see Northern communities benefit from the economic boom that is unfolding in the region,"" Ms. Aglukkaq said. The Arctic Council, whose members include the U.S., Russia, Denmark and current chair Sweden, was set up in 1996 as an intergovernmental forum for coordination among Arctic states. Experts see the region as an area of potential diplomatic dispute as countries move to develop its potentially bountiful and lucrative resources. With diplomatic tussles over Arctic waters and land on the increase, Canada believes that the voice of local indigenous populations may be drowned out. Native protests are currently at the top of the agenda within Canada after a hunger strike by a native chief here sparked a series of demonstrations across the country. Last year, Russia surprised the Council when it refused to send a representative to a group that represents its northern aboriginals at meetings. Ms. Aglukkaq, an Inuk who was born and raised in the Arctic territory of Nunavut, expressed her ""concern"" at the move. About 12.5% of the Arctic's 4 million inhabitants are indigenous people. Speaking at the Arctic Frontiers Conference on Monday, Ms. Aglukkaq said safe shipping in the Arctic was also on Canada's agenda. That means continuing current work on oil-spill prevention and the development of guidelines for Arctic tourism and cruise ship operators, she said. -For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com[http://wsj.com].

Norway's ruling party may back Arctic islands oil drive,Norway,"Norway's ruling Labour party provoked outrage from environmentalists as well as coalition members Thursday after it opened the way for oil exploration near the scenic archipelago of Lofoten. The committee charged with outlining the party's political programme late Wednesday came out in favour of an ""impact study"" that would assess the effects of oil production around the islands, where most people rely on the fishing and tourism sectors. The move could prove controversial in Norway's parliamentary elections, set to be held in September. Environmentalists claim past impact studies have always resulted in oil prospecting. The issue illustrates the tension between the oil industry and the fishing sector, both important sources of revenue for the country. The waters of Lofoten hold around 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate -- but they are also the spawning ground of the largest cod population in the world. The Labour party committee's decision, which has yet to be approved at the Labour party's April congress, was roundly criticised by NGOs. ""The turnaround of the Labour party is sad for such a fantastic food-producing area. But this is not a lost cause,"" said Frederic Hauge, president of the Bellona Foundation. The issue also appeared to cause some friction within Labour Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's coalition government, which also includes the agrarian Centre party and the Socialist Left party. The latter is strongly opposed to oil production in the area, saying it ""will not drop Lofoten"", and that it was confident that a coalition agreement blocking oil exploitation in the region could be renewed. The latest polls show that the elections could be difficult for the centre-left government. However, the opposition is currently also divided over the issue. phy/nsb/bm"
Norway's ruling party supports drilling; Arctic oil among top debates in coming election,Norway,"OSLO . Norway's ruling Labour Party is set to support oil exploration off a pristine northern archipelago, bringing to a head controversy over drilling in the Arctic in the run up to elections this year. The seas off the Lofoten islands, perched 200 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, have unique cold-water reefs and are the spawning grounds of the world's largest cod stock. The islands are also popular with tourists, attracted to their spectacular nature, with snow-capped mountains plunging into the sea and such activities as hiking, fishing and whale watching. But the seabed may hold 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, making it a prime area of interest for oil firms, such as Norway's Statoil ASA, which has pushed for the areas to be open to drilling as oil production in the North Sea tapers off. Oil output in Norway, the world's eighth-biggest exporter with a population of just five million, is expected to fall to a 25-year low in 2013. Two years ago, and after months of dispute, Labour struck a deal with its small coalition partners to forbid oil exploration off the islands until the parliamentary term ends in 2013. ""Given all the knowledge we have of the area, we believe it is a natural step to conduct an impact assessment study,"" said Helga Pedersen, Labour's deputy leader. State-controlled Statoil is leading the way in exploring the Arctic's oil wealth, but a number of oil companies are also moving into the region in Russia, Canada, Greenland, Alaska and north of Iceland. Despite some poorer numbers in the past month, Norway's economy remains one of Europe's strongest, and it has also wisely put aside US$700billion in oil revenue over the past two decades to provide for a future when its resource wealth runs out. Much of its current prosperity, however, is based on the oil-and-gas industry and the government is also under pressure from its conservative opponents in the north. Environmentalists condemned Labour's move and said they would campaign hard to convince voters not to back parties that support drilling off Lofoten. They will also lobby members of the Labour Party, which has to formally adopt the new policy at its party conference in April. ""Drilling in Lofoten ... not only threatens precious natural resources, it also threatens several thousands jobs in the fishing and tourism industries,"" said Nina Jensen, head of the Norwegian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). With Labour's new stance, Norway's top three parties all now support drilling around Lofoten but government support is not yet ensured. Elections are due in September and the winning party may be forced to rely on one of Norway's smaller parties, who generally oppose exploration in the Lofotens, to form a coalition. The Conservatives, the expected winners in the vote, are seen willing to compromise on the issue if this is needed to win the support of a coalition ally. Similarly, Labour's two current partners are also opposed to drilling in Lofoten."
Will the UK pick the free-trade winner?,Norway,"If the PM's referendum pledge damages links with the EU, he will need the World Trade Organisation's new head onside. By Mark Leftly Laos, the small land-locked communist nation in south-east Asia, this weekend joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) just as the UK, the birthplace of Adam Smith, appears to be on the verge of exiting arguably the greatest free-market structure ever formed. Laos is waking up to the need for foreign investment, while the UK move is upsetting some of its most important trading partners. David Cameron's announcement last month that he will hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union towards the end of 2017, should he be re-elected, was met with concern from the WTO. The confused reaction of the director-general, Pascal Lamy (left), was instructive. He seemed uncertain about the consequences of Cameron's announcement: critics argue that the near five-year lead time to a vote will mean that nations and companies will question whether or not the UK is a good place to trade. Lamy said: ""Whether a change in the relationship between the UK and Europe would change the trade relationship remains to be seen. I'm not saying I don't think so [that the relationship will change], but I know countries - like Norway or Switzerland - who are not members of the EU and whose trade relationships with the EU are very open."" Cameron has shown a clear interest in developing trade links with emerging economies through regular trade missions from Latin America to Asia. The WTO supervises and regulates trade between its 158 members, meaning the UK wants a director-general who will back the country as it looks to open up fast-growing economies that are rich in minerals, oil and labour. Lamy, a former politician, has led the WTO since 2005, but comes to the end of his second term this summer. There were seemingly well-sourced reports last year that the former business secretary Lord Mandelson was in the frame to replace the Frenchman, but instead a crowded field of nine candidates, none of whom is from Europe, are in the running (see above). The first candidate presentations to the WTO's membership took place behind closed doors last week, but a new boss doesn't have to be named until the end of May. That's a long time to wait for a job, but gives the UK, Europe and the US less than four months to identify the candidate who will best represent their interests from what is a fairly obscure field of diplomats, academics and trade experts. Shortly after the deadline for all potential candidates to throw their hats into the ring passed at the turn of the year, Ladbrokes installed the Scotland-born New Zealand trade minister Tim Groser as 3-1 joint favourite (with Costa Rica's Anabel Gonzalez) to succeed Lamy. Groser is thought to be favoured by Western nations, though the New Zealand foreign minister, Murray McCully, insists the campaign is built around the ""personal attributes"" of his experienced colleague rather than any geographical bias. That might well prove to be the undoing of Groser's pitch, as the man himself acknowledged after his Q&A; with organisation members. ""If it is a foreign policy question that we are trying to address in the choice of a director-general, then I'm not the answer,"" he said. There is a sense within the WTO that the new head needs to be someone from an emerging economy to reflect new centres of growth. This could favour Ghana's Alan Kyerematen, a trade adviser at the UN Commission for Africa - should his core support not divide between him and the continent's other candidate, Kenya's Amina Mohamed, who is also one of three women in the running. Mohamed was not afraid to play the gender card, arguing that it would ""send a very, very powerful signal"" if a woman got the role. Not wanting to lose any advantage over the Latin American Gonzalez or Indonesia's Mari Pangestu, Mohamed also argued that the woman would be best off coming from Africa. Where all the candidates seem to agree is that the WTO risks losing is relevance if it fails to reignite the Doha trading talks that started way before even Lamy's leadership, in 2001. ""The reality is that the round at this point in time is paralysing the system and we have to solve it,"" argued the Brazilian candidate, Roberto Azevedo, who is currently the fast-growing economic powerhouse's envoy to the WTO. The next Doha-round talks, rather confusingly, take place in Bali at the end of the year. The ambition is to lower trade barriers, but there have been many causes of fierce debate, particularly around agriculture, that have largely divided mature Western economies and those that are just finding their feet on the world stage. Last year, the WTO warned that there was a global trend towards protectionism, citing 182 measures introduced to restrict or potentially restrict trade over a nine-month period as evidence. Although the new WTO head can expect some significant progress at the December talks, it seems as if the plan to get a single agreement across so many national interests - in markets as broad as agriculture, goods and services - was simply too ambitious. The danger for the WTO is that it continues to be ignored by major economies that instead sign bilateral or multilateral trade agreements. Indeed, these will be the sort of negotiations that the UK would possibly have to conduct with the EU if the country should exit the bloc. However, if the new WTO DG can succeed in getting through some sort of watered-down pact in Bali, as many believe is possible, he or she would be lauded for cutting through international red tape, which could boost the world economy by an estimated $1trn (£635bn). Immediately, they would be feted as a major figure on the world stage. As a result, the British government must ensure that it picks the winner in this closely fought race, the field for which will soon narrow down to a handful of candidates. If the new head of the WTO can finally come up with a successful conclusion to some of the most protracted trade talks in history, then the UK cannot afford for this person to be as unclear as Lamy on the country's trading future. Doubts from someone with that kind of political and economic weight could lead to potential trading partners looking away from the UK. THE CANDIDATES 1 ALAN JOHN KWADWO KYEREMATEN (GHANA) A former ambassador to the US, Mr Kyerematen is supported by the African Union bloc 2 ANABEL GONZALEZ (COSTA RICA) Ms Gonzalez knows the WTO well, having headed up its agriculture and commodities division from 2006 to 2009 3 MARI ELKA PANGESTU (INDONESIA) The 56-year-old has been Indonesia's minister for tourism and creative economy since October 2011 4 TIM GROSER (NEW ZEALAND) Born in Scotland in 1950, the Kiwi politician was New Zealand's ambassador to the WTO from 2002 to 2005 5 AMINA C MOHAMED (KENYA) This lawyer could spoil Mr Kyerematen's candidacy should some African states back the east over the west coast 6 AHMAD THOUGAN HINDAWI (JORDAN) This 47-year-old Birmingham University post-graduate helped lead Jordan's economic liberalisation 7 HERMINIO BLANCO (MEXICO) This economist was in the Mexican government for 15 years to 2000, but has since worked in the private sector 8 TAEHO BARK (REPUBLIC OF KOREA) South Korea's trade minister has published numerous books and papers on economics and trade policy 9 ROBERTO CARVALHO DE AZEVEDO (BRAZIL) This 55-year-old career diplomat was the last of the nine nominated as a candidate last month"
Environment: Frozen frontiers,Norway,"For a body that has just undergone the biggest transformation in its 17-year history, the Arctic Council is hopelessly self-effacing. Tucked away at the end of a long, dim corridor inside a building full of polar researchers in Norway's northern city of Tromsø, it has just a handful of staff in a few temporary offices and an unpretentious meeting room. It hardly seems much for the club of eight countries with territory inside the Arctic Circle: the US, Russia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland and Denmark, which represents Greenland. Like so much else in the Arctic, however, this is about to change. At a little-noticed signing ceremony three weeks ago, the council finally set up a permanent secretariat in Tromsø with its first full-time director, a senior Icelandic civil servant. Soon, it will have more staff, a grander office and a bigger presence. It was, says Espen Barth Eide, Norway's foreign minister, ""a very important day in the history of the Arctic"". Yet this is only the latest sign of a surge in diplomatic, commercial and scientific activity in one of the world's last unspoilt wildernesses. Much of this Arctic awakening is being driven by the belief that rapidly melting Arctic ice will unleash access to more than a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas deposits, plus a lot of fish and tourist attractions. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. < > So far, it has unfolded peacefully. But two distinct schools of thought are emerging about whether it will stay this way or eventually erupt into what Scott Borgerson, a US maritime policy specialist, has described as ""an armed mad dash"" for resource spoils in a region that never expected to need the rules to prevent such chaos. ""Either outcome is possible,"" says Canadian academic, Michael Byers, author of Who Owns the Arctic? Right now, he says, ""there is a concerted effort on the part of all the Arctic countries to steer future development towards co-operation and away from conflict"". But doubts persist. ""It sounds like Europe in 1935,"" says Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, the co-author of a study showing that some Arctic countries, including Russia, have already started rebuilding their Arctic military capabilities while others have plans to follow. Such is the uncertain backdrop to a region producing more surprises each year, not least in the shipping trade. The Arctic is home to two potentially game-changing shipping routes: the Northwest Passage through the Canadian archipelago and the Northern Sea Route above Russia. Each is thousands of kilometres shorter than current routes between Europe and Asia, and would be thousands of dollars cheaper to use - if they weren't full of ice for much of the year. But as the Arctic continues to warm faster than climate science models predict, this is changing fast, especially in the more developed Northern Sea Route over Russia. Last year 46 ships passed along this route, up from just four in 2010, according to data from the Centre for High North Logistics, a non-profit group backed by Norway's government that promotes Arctic shipping. Those 46 ships included polar research icebreaker the Snow Dragon, the first Chinese ship to make an Arctic crossing. ""It was striking how little ice there actually was during the voyage,"" says Egill Thor Nielsson, an Icelandic researcher aboard the vessel. Still, the Suez and Panama canals are unlikely to be worried just yet. They had more than 30,000 passages between them in 2012, said Paal Hilde of the Norwegian Institute of Defence Studies. ""The Northern Sea Route has to grow massively to become any kind of competitor with these other routes,"" he says. But the prospect of more shipping in a region where an oil spill could cause extreme environmental damage is of mounting concern, and not just to green activists. Cruise ship numbers in remote parts of the Arctic have grown over the past decade to the point at which, in peak season, there are as many as eight ships a week between Greenland and sparsely populated Spitsbergen Island, says Norway's vice-admiral Haakon Bruun-Hanssen. Some have upwards of 3,000 passengers, more than Spitsbergen's population, he told an Arctic conference in Tromsø last month. ""Due to the size of these ships, any accidents in these areas will have a catastrophic magnitude,"" he said. These maritime developments are among the most visible signs of change in the Arctic, and a big reason why bodies such as the Arctic Council are now unusually popular. When it was founded in 1996, the council agreed to admit organisations with an interest in the region as observers. A few European nations joined, including Germany and the UK, as well as the World Wildlife Fund and some less obvious groups, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Over the years, the observer waiting list grew longer (there are now 14 applications outstanding) and more Asian. China applied in 2006, South Korea in 2008 (along with the EU), Japan in 2009, Singapore in 2011 and India in 2012. Those who watch the council's workings closely trace the delays to a mix of diplomatic wrangles. Canada, for example, has been in dispute with the EU over Brussels' ban on seal products. Norway has until recently been wary of China, following Beijing's fury over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize going to jailed Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo. All of these, however, are an aside. The real measure of the council's importance has more to do with what its eight permanent member states are doing, not least its most powerful, the US. The last time the council had one of its two-yearly ministerial meetings, in 2011, Washington did two things it had never done before: it sent Hillary Clinton, its secretary of state, to the meeting rather than a more junior diplomat, and agreed to the setting up of a permanent secretariat. The same meeting signed off on another first: a binding treaty requiring the eight council members to co-ordinate the search-and-rescue efforts likely to be needed as a thawing Arctic makes shipping easier. May's ministerial meeting is expected to finalise a second treaty, this time on oil spill prevention, as well as the observer waiting list. For all that, the Arctic issue that provokes the most long-term anxiety is the region's oil and gas potential. The last public estimate of what lies beneath the region's seabed comes from a 2008 US Geological Survey study that showed the Arctic could have as much as 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil. As the Arctic melts, it is naturally assumed that companies will be more eager to extract this bounty. But so far, experts say the price of oil has been much more influential. The Arctic is undergoing its second period of offshore exploration, says Andrew Latham of the Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy. During the first, in the 1970s and 1980s, as many as 20 new wells a year were drilled. That number dipped during the 1990s in line with global oil prices, but it is now rising. Wood Mackenzie thinks the number of new wells drilled will only reach about 10 per year in the near term, despite the changing climate. ""Fundamentally, the oil price is what you are talking about,"" says Dr Latham, adding that the amount companies are spending in this expensive and inhospitable region is relatively small in proportion to their investments in other countries. Individually, however, the costs are large. Royal Dutch Shell has just spent $5bn struggling to drill wells off Alaska, and the UK's Cairn Energy has spent more than $1bn on fruitless drilling off Greenland. And these costs look even higher considering the USGS study appeared towards the beginning of a revolution in US shale gas and oil production. Since then, predictions of future global energy supplies have been overturned. Last year US gas prices were down to their lowest level in a decade. ""That means very, very expensive gas sitting offshore in the Arctic is now even more difficult to bring to market than it was before,"" says the USGS's Dr Donald L. Gautier, principal investigator for the 2008 assessment. Still, the potential worth of these resources in a world whose energy-hungry population is forecast to grow from 7bn to as much as 9bn by 2050 is clear. Clearer, some say, than the rules governing who will be able to extract them. First in line are the five states with an extensive Arctic coastline: Russia, the US, Canada, Norway and Denmark. Under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, each country has rights to an Exclusive Economic Zone stretching 200 nautical miles offshore that lets it extract fish or fossil fuels from in or under the sea. Beyond that 200 nautical mile limit, things become more tricky. Countries that have ratified the Law of the Sea convention can make a submission for more extensive seabed rights if they can prove their continental shelves extend that far. So far, Russia and Norway are alone among the five Arctic coastal states to have made such a submission and Norway's relatively modest claim has been approved. Russia, which made a much bigger grab for an area extending up to the North Pole, was told to come back with better data. It was an expedition to gather this evidence that led to the planting of a Russian flag on the North Pole seabed in 2007, a move that set off much of the anxiety about potential Arctic conflict. The US has not ratified the Law of the Sea convention, despite the best efforts of much of its foreign policy elite, who say this could undermine its ability to assert its rights in future. Canada and Denmark are due to make their submissions shortly. Once they do, the world will see if their claims overlap with those of Russia. ""This is where talk of the potential conflict in the Arctic comes about,"" says Martin Pratt, an international maritime boundaries expert at the UK's Durham university. Prof Pratt says such talk is overblown, arguing that experience of settling Arctic boundary disputes suggest that even if there are overlapping claims, they will be peacefully resolved. In addition, all five Arctic coastal states agreed in 2008 they would settle any territorial disputes under accepted principles of international law as they extended their claims to more Arctic territory. And all except Russia are Nato allies, so are considered unlikely to start firing on each other. Meanwhile, even with record Arctic thawing, oil and gas operations in the region remain difficult and expensive. ""In 50 years, if the ice cap is gone, it might change somewhat,"" says Prof Pratt. ""But it's still going to be cold, it's still going to be stormy and it's still going to be dark. It isn't the first place in the world you would look to exploit oil if you were given the choice."""
Norway by bike and train; Exploring Norway by train and bike provided Tim Burrows with a dramatic escape amid a frozen landscape that inspired the makers of The Empire Strikes Back.,Norway,"We were hurtling towards Finse on Norway’s Bergensbanen (Bergen Line), the highest main line railway in Europe and one of the many examples in this country of the mastery of transportation over the unwieldy, fjord-indented land mass. In 1909, when King Haakon VII opened the railway that connects the country’s two main cities, Bergen in the west and Oslo in the east, he called it 'Norway’s greatest achievement in our generation’. It has since become the most popular train journey in Norway, and its pull doesn’t end there. When the train stopped at Voss, midway between Bergen and Finse, a large group of South Korean tourists led by Norwegian guides packed the carriage and quickly let my girlfriend Hayley and me know that we were in the wrong seats. You begin to grasp why the line is so popular when you peer out of the window and notice the passing scenes of pine trees and waterfalls, still lakes and snow-capped mountains. Such is the Norwegians’ love of it that during its centenary in 2009 the entire journey was made into a seven-and-a-half-hour, real-time documentary – covering the journey from Oslo to Bergen in full – and screened by the broadcaster NRK. More than a million people, a quarter of the country’s population, tuned in to watch it. A week before, we had landed in Oslo and taken a bus across the country from the austerity and calm of the capital city to the mountainous glory of Norway’s wild west. Our destination was the village of Fjærland, situated by the Fjærlands­fjord, a branch of the largest fjord in Norway, the Sogne­fjord, on the country’s long, sinewy coastal side, to attend the wedding of our friends Beate and Rune, who live further south in Stavanger. We visited the book town Mundal, Norway’s Hay-on-Wye, noting the inevitably substantial krim sections lined with Nesbøs and Larssons. With some other wedding guests we hiked 1,000m up in the mountainous Jotunheimen ('Home of the Giants’) National Park to view the arm of the main glacier Jostedalsbreen – the biggest in mainland Europe – eating lunch at the top in an 18-bunk cabin for travellers. When the wedding came around, many local villagers were invited. After the ceremony, Beate and Rune travelled from the church to the reception at the village hall in a decorated trailer pulled along by a farmer’s tractor, before Beate’s father sang a full-blooded version of Gershwin’s Summertime. We left for Bergen by boat the day after. Arriving in the ancient trading port at dusk, we checked in at the Havnekontoret, a hotel enamoured of post­modern business-class interiors – our room boasted faux crocodile-skin wallpaper – and situated in a neo­classical building formerly owned by the Port of Bergen, at the end of the Unesco-protected timber-framed drag, Bryggen (Norwegian for 'wharf’). The next day before dinner we took wine up to the tower that overlooks the harbour. The fishing trade sustained Bergen for centuries. The Hanseatic Museum at the other end of Bryggen focuses on the lives of Hanseatic traders, from sailors to management, who populated Bergen from the 14th to the 18th century, when it was the most important trading hub in Scandinavia, preparing dried and pressed fish from north Norway and taking it around the world. But the tourist trade has affected Bergen’s famous fish market. At a party we were told by a young local of the disastrous gentrification of the fish market, a dark tale of deep-fried tourist food in place of the fresher and more affordable catch of the day. After two nights in Bergen we climbed aboard the 7.58 to Oslo and set off for Finse. We were treated to picturebook views, and after a while we started to ascend. By the time we approached Finse over the Hardangervidda, the largest mountain plateau in Europe, the landscape had changed into a more desolate, craggy affair. It felt extremely isolated. Winds often reach gale force; in winter temperatures plummet to -25C or lower. The arresting, odd bleakness of the terrain was utilised by the creators of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back as the location for the ice planet Hoth, and rushing past the scene, you realise that they could not have picked a better location. Remoteness made accessible; an unworldly, extra­terrestrial locale with a hotel convenient for Hollywood crews to stay at. The tourist settlement is at 1,222m above sea level, a statistic honoured by the name of the main hotel, Finse 1222. It is set back from the platform at Finse station, and acts as base camp from which visitors can explore the surrounding area. Cars are not permitted up here – there are no roads – so the train is the only way to reach the area. Our room was spacious and calm with no tele­vision, just tall, wide windows displaying the view of the Hardangerjøkulen glacier and the Finsevatn lake. The hotel was opened by a Norwegian, Joseph Klem, and his wife, Alice, a British expat, who had initially moved to Finse to cook for the navvies who were building the Bergensbanen. The hotel soon became a luxury establishment with guests from all over the world. Adventure-hungry aristos and members of the literati voyaged across the North Sea from Britain. Polar explorers wanting to acclimatise to Arctic conditions came in the winter. Scott’s party trained in Finse. On the door of our room was a copy of a letter of thanks from Ernest Shackleton to Klem, who looked after the explorer and his party when they visited in 1914. Today the hotel is run by fresh-faced outdoorsy types, often hailing from cities such as Bergen and Oslo and coming up here for a season. Across the tracks from the hotel, the Rallar (Navvy) Museum, narrates the sheer defiance of nature that the construction of the Bergensbanen represented. More than 15,000 men helped to construct the railway, working even in winter. Timber for the sleepers was transported east from Sogne­fjorden. The smell of dynamite blasts permeated the air. Snowdrifts and snow slides blocked the line as they tried to construct it. The Rallarvegen ('Navvy Road’), a stony, grey track built for the railway workers, has been used by holidaying cyclists since 1974. In the bike rental shop attached to the hotel, we were told how the tyres are specially made to handle Finse’s uneven terrain. We made our way along the track to the next settlement, Fagernut, pausing to notice fluffy seeding perennials and to take photographs of the strange land­scape. Hayley pointed out a local who was making steady if tiring work transporting himself and his grandson using an old rail bike contraption on the disused line that runs alongside the cycle path. We stopped to have a shouted conversation and he told us that he had restored the vehicle that was used when the line was first built, before returning to the task of travelling back to the house the family visits every summer. We carried on our tour de Finse, which was fast becoming a geological dream of a bicycle ride. The path was strewn with rocks and very uneven, but the tyres were coping admirably (punctures are a rarity with these bikes). The further east we travelled the more frequent the frozen patches became, meaning we had to get off our bikes to continue over compacted snow that had resisted the charms of the summer. There is something wonderfully contrary about tramping with a bike over snow in August. We stopped at Fagernut and ate our packed lunch in the sun, before travelling back the way we came on the Rallarvegen. Back at the hotel, our cheeks blasted by the cold wind, we promptly fell asleep in the cosy lounge, waiting for dinner time. Apart from the glacier-facing views, the kitchen was the highlight of the hotel. Breakfast and dinner are included in the price of the room – you need feeding up here if you are going to make the most of the terrain. We ate vichyssoise with truffle oil, grilled scallop with wasabi purée and Serrano ham, followed by lamb with bacon risotto and mint pesto – all delicious and filling – offset with an ale brewed at nearby Flåm. As in most of Norway the ale (and indeed renting a bike) does not come cheap. The exchange rate for the British visitor is crippling: our room typically costs 1,350 kroner (£152) per night during the week, 1,450 (£163) at the weekend, which is a lot for a basic room, regardless of the scenery – although the inclusion of dinner does soften the blow. The country has become one of the world’s wealthiest since it found oil and gas reserves in the North Sea in the 1960s. The financial success has been allied with a campaign of sensible saving, in a mission to make the country secure after centuries of upheaval. It succeeded: Norway has one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the world, estimated at $400 billion in 2009, which is used to give citizens security via benefits such as large pensions and far greater periods of paid-for maternity and paternity leave than in most of Europe. Britain, on the other hand, spent its North Sea oil money on keeping taxes low. The imbalance in exchange rate means that the cost of food and drink when travelling through Norway really does add up, but most good hotels know this and provide ample breakfasts. At Finse, for example, alongside the homemade breads, scrambled eggs, bacon, salmon, trout, cheese, cold meats, cereals and fruit, large sandwich bags were provided for takeaway lunch. It seemed a shame to leave after spending only 24 hours in Finse. We wanted to stay and explore for a fortnight, but our itinerary beckoned, and we were soon on the 10.19 to Oslo. Entering the city felt like returning to earth; back to summer. We attended the music festival Øya, passing young Norwegians eating and drinking alfresco in the park nearby: Østkanten feels a lot like London’s East End. We had tapas at Delicatessen in the trendy Grünerløkka district and visited the Norsk Folkemuseum, where the main attraction is the 800-year-old wooden Stavkirke (stave church), moved from the mountain village of Gol bit by bit by horse-drawn carriage. On the final morning of our journey we ate breakfast at our hotel, the Grand Comfort Central, located in the Oslo Central Station building itself. Sitting next to the station concourse eating smoked trout and drinking black coffee, we watched people wheel suitcases to and fro, before doing so ourselves, bound for London but with our thoughts still parked at the Hardangervidda. visitnorway.com[http://www.visitnorway.com]"
With enemies like the Better Together campaign who needs friends?,Norway,"INDEPENDENCE has its costs. Things aren’t looking good. “The public finances are likely to come under pressure over the longer term primarily as a result of the ageing population ... the Government would end up having to spend more as a share of national income on age-related items such as pensions and healthcare ... non-demographic trends are likely to reduce revenue from sources such as North Sea oil.” Oh, well. That’s it – we’re stuffed. Why weren’t we told this before? Actually, we were. That quote above is not from John Swinney’s leaked report to the Scottish Government. It is from the report by the Office For Budget Responsibility’s Fiscal Sustainability Report, presented to the UK Coalition Government in July 2012 – and the country it refers to is the UK. These affordability issues are the same north and south of the Border – actually, they are less of a problem in Scotland. Swinney’s “bombshell report” wasn’t about “cutting pensions” as some parts of the press claimed, it was about how much Scotland could reasonably put into an oil fund for the future given its social-spending commitments. Choices have to be made. You can’t expect an independent Scotland to be immune from economic uncertainty, immune to the ageing population, immune to recession and fluctuating oil prices. But no credible economist seriously argues today that Scotland could not survive as an independent small nation like Norway, Denmark or Finland. Actually, in an age of economic uncertainty, John Swinney is a useful guy to have around. He is ultra-cautious, often to the despair of his Cabinet colleagues. But this Finance Secretary has achieved a remarkable feat over the last six years in managing to afford all of Alex Salmond’s giveaway policies – abolition of student fees, free prescriptions, free bus passes, free personal care – within a static budget that has been squeezed in real terms. Commentators like me kept saying it couldn’t be done, that the SNP Government would find it impossible to balance the books without cutting spending on health. We were wrong. SO, the fact that cautious John was trying to rein in his high-spending Cabinet colleagues by telling them a few home truths is no bad thing. The fact it was leaked last week will, I think, be to the Yes campaign’s long-term benefit, provided they don’t retreat into a defensive shell, snarling about the “Unionist press”. The press coverage was over the top, economically illiterate and rather childish. But you don’t get to choose the press and this is the same media that will be covering the independence campaign next year. The SNP will have to find ways of addressing Scotland’s fears if it wants to get this anxious, risk-averse nation to step into the unknown. This is the downside of basing the case for independence on economics alone. It’s not called the dismal science for nothing. Even the most benign economic picture can look bleak if you focus on risk. Better Together leaked Swinney’s “secret files” to coincide with publication of the latest Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures, an annual statement showing the balance between spending and tax revenues. This year it confirmed Scotland’s deficit would be 5% of GDP – but that is substantially less than the UK deficit of 8%. In other words, Scotland is in a much better place financially right now than the rest of the UK. Did no-one notice that the UK lost its AAA rating the other week? And remember that if Scotland were independent, the UK would not be able to rely on the £11 billion a year from the North Sea, so its deficit would rise. This is important. It means Scotland is in no danger of becoming another Greece, or Ireland – unable to pay its way and suffering a sovereign debt crisis and internal devaluation. This is not exclusively because of the £1.5 trillion of oil in the North Sea. Scotland has five of the world’s leading universities, one-quarter of Europe’s offshore wind and wave energy, one of the most valuable tourist brands in the world and luxury exports such as whisky, which brings in £4bn a year. We might even be capable of making things if we had any industry left. But there is nothing certain in economics, and the job of a finance minister is not to tell people what they want to hear. Oil revenues are volatile. Ten years ago, the price of a barrel was less than half what it is today. It would be unwise for an independent Scotland to rely on natural resources alone, and a proper industrial strategy would have to be introduced to diversify the Scottish economy. But an independent Scotland would be less dependent on oil income than Norway, which has the world’s highest standard of living. We have an ageing population, a situation marginally worse in Scotland than in England. I say “worse” – in fact, people living longer is a very good thing. But it does mean you need lots of young workers to pay the taxes to look after them. Ten years ago, everyone believed Scotland’s population was going to decline below five million. In fact, it has risen to 5.3 million: its highest level ever. All those young Polish workers coming here are having large families, which has turned the situation round. But with the UK imposing ever tighter immigration restrictions, this may be choked off if Scotland stays in the UK. Meanwhile, Scotland exports many of its graduates and skilled workers because we don’t have jobs for them here. When I was rector of Edinburgh University, I was acutely aware this world-class institution was churning out large numbers of brilliant graduates who would never find work in Scotland. They take their learning south or abroad, which is what Scots have been doing for the past 200 years. Now, an independent Scotland might make this worse; there is no guarantee of anything. But I am finding it increasingly hard to see how Scotland’s problems can be addressed without substantially greater economic powers and investment. Scotland’s industry has long gone; the start-up rate for new businesses is dismal; the financial sector – look at RBS – is in crisis. Scotland is falling off the economic map in a UK dominated by the city state of London. It’s the HS2 factor: Scotland pays, through taxes and oil revenues, to build a high-speed rail network which starts in London and stops at Manchester. Last week, we learned that 6000 troops which were supposed to come to Scotland will go to Salisbury and Northern Ireland. Even Lord Heseltine says that the greatest problem facing he UK is over-centralisation of economic life in London and the southeast. Devolution has begun to address the “democratic deficit” in Scotland, but what the Scottish Parliament lacks is power to address very deep-seated economic problems. It isn’t only Nationalists who are concerned about this. As I pointed out last week, the Labour shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, is proposing a national convention, to look at ways of preventing a No in the referendum leading to a decade of despair in Scotland. If Scotland votes No, there will be no Union dividend to fall back on. Living on handouts from Westminster is no longer an option. Debilitating dependency will only turn Scotland into the introverted, negative and depressed little country that is presented to us every week in much of the Scottish press. That is the true message of Swinney’s secret bombshell. The SNP should start leaking these bombshell reports on a monthly basis."
WSJ BLOG: Energy Journal: Fire and Ice,Norway,"(This story has been posted on The Wall Street Journal Online's Market Beat blog at http://blogs.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/marketbeat[http://blogs.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/marketbeat].) By Ben Winkley Here's your morning jolt of news, insight and analysis on the global energy business. Send us tips, suggestions and complaints: ben.winkley@wsj.com and james.herron@wsj.com Click here to receive this morning email newsletter BIG PICTURE OUTLOOK At this time each month the energy market gets quick-fire clarity from the big three industry groups -- the producers of OPEC, the consumers of the IEA and the EIA's views from the biggest energy market, the U.S. It seems that the acronymous groups are broadly in agreement about the state of things. First up, The Wall Street Journal's Sarah Kent delves into OPEC's thinking. The cartel said it expects lower demand growth on both sides of the Atlantic, and for increased U.S. output to cut into demand for its own product. As the Journal's David Bird reports, the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirmed the second part of that -- U.S. crude-oil output will hit a 24-year high this fall, to exceed net imports for the first time since 1996, it said. The International Energy Agency then squared the circle, the Journal says, cutting its forecasts for global demand growth and increasing its expectations of supply growth, mostly from non-OPEC countries. NEW FUEL: METHANE The search for new sources of energy always throws up some surprises, but few as unexpected as the latest thing from Japan. Researchers have extracted methane gas from frozen undersea deposits -- a resource known as ""fire ice."" This is supposedly so plentiful that there is enough of it trapped beneath the permafrost and under the oceans to guarantee fossil fuels for everyone for centuries, Reuters' John Kemp explains. The Washington Post says there could be up to 100,000,000,000,000 (that's one hundred thousand trillion) cubic feet of it, compared with U.S. shale reserves of 827 trillion cubic feet. Grist.org cautions that fire ice is no more than a lattice of methane molecules trapped inside frozen water crystals -- sure, get the methane out of the ice and there is gas to burn. But there is no ice left. There are deposits of this fire ice all over the world -- Japan is leading the way with commercial production tentatively penciled in for 2016, the Financial Times reports. NORWAY EYES COSTS AND BENEFITS The Norwegians may be leading the way in the great Arctic oil push -- channeling the spirit of Roald Amundsen, who led the way at the other end of the earth -- but they are treading somewhat warily. Plans to drill in Lofoten, which is just about the furthest north one can go in Norway, are meeting with strong local opposition from those who make their living from tourism or fishing. Reuters notes that the area is a spawning ground for the world's richest cod stocks. And puffins. The Deepwater Horizon disaster showed how much damage a spill can create, both environmentally and financially. Shell's adventures in the Alaskan Arctic have bought into sharp focus the potential for oil over ice. Planning for drilling in the pristine north will likely lead to increased costs and extended project timetables. In other words, it is a business that requires patience. This week, Norway said it had run out of that virtue as it began a review of oil and gas projects operated by BP and Talisman Energy -- the latter has been forced to scrap a huge platform before a drop of oil was processed. As the Journal's Kjetil Malkenes Hovland explains, tax incentives mean these losses will end up being shouldered in part by the Norwegian government. MARKETS Crude-oil futures traded broadly higher Thursday, but with both benchmark contracts subject to different influences and amid signs that some long-held market structures are changing.

Teeing Off at Edge of the Arctic? A Chinese Plan Baffles Iceland,Norway,"GRIMSSTADIR, Iceland -- Struggling to stand upright against a howling wind, Bragi Benediktsson looked out over his family's land -- a barren expanse of snow and ice that a Chinese billionaire wants to turn into a golf course -- and laughed. ''Golf here is difficult,'' said Mr. Benediktsson, a 75-year-old sheep farmer. It was 11 a.m., and a pale sun had only just crawled sluggishly into the sky. The snow, which began falling in September, will probably continue until May. Even for Icelanders accustomed to harsh weather and isolation, Grimsstadir is a particularly desolate spot. But thanks to a poetry-loving Chinese tycoon with a thing for snow, it has become the setting for a bizarre Icelandic saga featuring geopolitical intrigue, tens of millions of dollars and a swarm of dark conspiracy theories. At the center of the drama is Huang Nubo, a former official in the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Department who, now a property developer in Beijing, wants to build a luxury hotel and an ''eco golf course'' for wealthy Chinese seeking clean air and solitude. ''It never seemed a very convincing business plan,'' said Iceland's interior minister, Ogmundur Jonasson, who last year rejected a request that Mr. Huang be exempted from Icelandic laws that restrict foreign ownership of land. ''I put many questions and got no answers,'' the minister added. Prodded by diplomats from the United States and other countries to take a hard look at Mr. Huang's intentions, Mr. Jonasson questioned what might lie behind China's curious interest in Grimsstadir. ''One has to look at this from a geopolitical perspective and ask about motivations,'' Mr. Jonasson said. Rebuffed in an initial attempt to buy a vast area of wilderness covering more than 100 square miles, Mr. Huang's Beijing-based company, the Zhongkun Group, is now pushing for a long-term lease arrangement instead -- and counting on the prospect that elections in Iceland next month will lead to a new, and perhaps more welcoming, government. The current government in Reykjavik, a left-of-center coalition, has mostly given Mr. Huang the cold shoulder. Even ministers who favor Chinese investment wonder what is really going on. Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said that he saw no reason to block Mr. Huang's hotel venture, which is expected to cost more than $100 million, but that he was puzzled by Mr. Huang's desire to build a high-end resort in a place so isolated that ''you can almost hear ghosts dancing in the snow.'' As for playing golf, Mr. Skarphedinsson added, ''that doesn't seem very sensible.'' Such bafflement has stirred much speculation about what the Chinese tycoon and perhaps the Chinese authorities are up to. A proposal by the Zhongkun Group to renovate a small landing strip in the Grimsstadir area and buy 10 aircraft led to anxious talk of a Chinese air base. The area's relative proximity to deep fjords on Iceland's northeast coast near offshore oil reserves fueled speculation about a Chinese push for a naval facility and access to the Arctic's bountiful supplies of natural resources. Far-fetched rumors about Chinese missiles and listening posts led to worries about military personnel pouring in disguised as hoteliers and golf caddies. Mr. Huang could not be reached for comment: he was off climbing a mountain, his company said. In response to written questions, Xu Hong, a vice president at the company, dismissed speculation of a military purpose or other ulterior motives as ''the guesswork of post-cold-war thinking.'' Ms. Xu said Grimsstadir had been chosen because ''there is market demand in China'' for peace and quiet. ''Most Chinese now don't like to travel to dirty, noisy places,'' she said. Mr. Skarphedinsson scoffed at a widely held belief here that Mr. Huang is leading a plot by Beijing to secure a strategic foothold in Iceland, a NATO member that is entirely bereft of military muscle. Iceland also sits astride what will become important shipping lanes as ice-choked Arctic waters warm. China has openly declared its interest in shipping routes through the Arctic and in using Iceland as a future transport hub, Mr. Skarphedinsson said. But these goals, he added, have been hurt, not helped, by the cloud of suspicion generated by Mr. Huang. ''One thing the Chinese Communist Party never failed at since Mao is public relations, but the P.R. in this venture has failed miserably,'' Iceland's foreign minister said. Beijing's keen interest in Iceland, nearby Greenland and the wider Arctic region is well known. China is negotiating a Free Trade Area accord with Reykjavik, its first with a European nation, and last year it sent its prime minister at the time, Wen Jiabao, for a two-day visit. A Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, stopped off last year as part of a push by Beijing to gain entry as an observer to the Arctic Council, a body comprising the United States, Canada, Russia, Iceland and Nordic states in or near Arctic waters. China has also opened what, physically at least, is the biggest foreign embassy by far in Reykjavik, even though it has only seven accredited diplomats. ''Nobody knows what the devil they are up to,'' said Einar Benediktsson, Iceland's former ambassador to Washington and a critic of his country's expanding ties with Beijing. ''All we know is that it is very important to China to get a foothold in the Arctic, and Iceland is an easy prey.'' Mr. Huang's enthusiasm for Iceland at first stirred little concern. Nobody paid much attention when, in 2010, he suddenly popped up in Reykjavik to renew a long-dormant friendship with Hjorleifur Sveinbjornsson, a translator of Chinese literature he had roomed with at Peking University in the 1970s. Mr. Sveinbjornsson doubts his old roommate is part of an elaborate gambit by China. ''If we had not shared a room he would never have even heard of Iceland,'' he said. He is not sure that Grimsstadir will work as a resort: ''It is not the first place I would have chosen.'' But, noting that Mr. Huang ''is not an idiot,'' Mr. Sveinbjornsson said that ''maybe it takes somebody from the outside to see the potential.'' During his first trip to Iceland in 2010, Mr. Huang made no mention of any business plans but focused instead on poetry, announcing that he would put up $1 million to establish and finance the China-Iceland Cultural Fund. Led by his former roommate, the fund has since organized two meetings of poets, the first in Reykjavik in 2010, the second a year later in Beijing. A third planned in Norway for last year was scrapped after Mr. Huang's company declared Norway unacceptable as a site. Mr. Sveinbjornsson said no reason had been given, but he linked the move to Beijing's continuing fury at Norway over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in Oslo, which went to Liu Xiaobo, a jailed dissident Chinese writer. Less than a year after his first visit, Mr. Huang returned to Iceland and offered Mr. Benediktsson, the sheep farmer, $7 million for his land and that of some relatives and a second family. A business plan submitted later to the government by the Zhongkun Group said ''the location fitted perfectly with our strategic plans for developing environmentally friendly eco resorts in remote locations.'' The company said it would build a 100-room five-star resort hotel, luxury villas and the golf course. While exotic golf courses are all the rage now, this one seemed to many here a long shot. ''I've looked at this very closely and gone through all the documents, and I'm just aghast,'' said Edward Huijbens, director of the Icelandic Tourism Research Center in Akureyri, the main town in northern Iceland. ''The whole project is fundamentally not credible.'' But Mr. Huang's business strategy has apparently impressed the state-owned China Development Bank, which, according to the Zhongkun Group, last year reached a ''cooperation agreement'' with the company worth about $800 million. Ms. Xu, Zhongkun's vice president, said the Chinese bank ''will provide loans and financial support to concrete projects by Zhongkun, including, but not exclusively, in Iceland.'' There is now talk that some local mayors will buy the Grimsstadir land -- with money provided by Zhongkun -- and then lease a portion of it to Mr. Huang, but Mr. Jonasson, the interior minister who refused to give a green light to Mr. Huang's plans last year, is still suspicious. ''There are so many loose ends,'' the minister said. Changing a purchase into a lease does not change the fact that the hotel-golf complex ''makes very little sense,'' he added. Mr. Jonasson said Mr. Huang ''is not just a simple poet wanting to find peace of mind in the mountains of Iceland.'' Mr. Benediktsonn, the sheep farmer, has been swinging back and forth on whether he wants to sell his property. He does not like the idea that the area would be flooded with Chinese tourists and golf carts, but doubts that the resort will ever materialize, and, mindful of his own advanced age, calculates that if it does he will not be around. ''When the hotel goes up, I'll be down in the ground,'' he said."
Canada praised internationally for stand on pollution from Arctic shipping,Norway,"Canada is winning a rare bit of environmental praise from the international community for its stand on pollution from shipping in Arctic waters. Documents obtained by The Canadian Press show Canada is pushing hard to outlaw the discharge of oily wastes or garbage anywhere in the North. Canada's proposal, during negotiations for a mandatory global shipping code in the Arctic, has won the support of several countries including Germany and France – nations that often criticize Canada over the issues of climate change and management of wildlife such as seals and polar bears. “Canada actually took quite good leadership on this issue,” said Lars Erik Mangset, of the World Wildlife Fund, which was an official observer at the talks held in late March in London. Countries belonging to the International Maritime Organization have been working to thrash out a mandatory code of conduct for shipping in Arctic waters as climate change makes the formerly ice-choked seas more accessible. The talks involve everything from the safety of sailors and construction standards for ships to rules to protect the delicate Arctic environment. Forecasts suggest Arctic shipping will continue to grow over the coming decades in both volume and type – everything from huge ore carriers to cruise ships carrying thousands of tourists. Last September, an informal meeting in Washington of states involved in the talks produced a document outlining minimum standards on environmental protection. “It aims quite low,” said Mr. Mangset in an interview from Oslo, Norway. In London, Canadian negotiators proposed much higher standards, based on Canadian legislation that has been in place since 1970. Those rules – similar to those in place for the Antarctic – forbid discharging oil, oily waste, or any kind of garbage into Canadian Arctic waters. “The Canadian and Antarctic experience demonstrates that a zero discharge standard is practicable,” says the Canadian proposal. “The Canadian experience also shows that it is not a significant barrier to cost-effective shipping, for purposes ranging from community supply to resource development and limited but growing through traffic.” Transport Canada, the department responsible for the negotiations, said the proposal is intended to ensure standards around the circumpolar world match those already in place in Canada. “Canada continues to support the development of an international polar code that will provide an equivalent level of safety and environmental protection to that of our law,” said spokeswoman Kelly James. Although Canada's proposal was not formally tabled, it garnered enough support to make its way into recommendations that will now go meetings of the Marine Environment Protection Committee. Those recommendations suggest dumping oil, oily waste or garbage into any part of the Arctic be against international law. The next talks take place in May. Although the polar code was supposed to be in place already, Mr. Mangset said the earliest talks could end would be 2014, followed by an 18-month implementation period. Shippers now operate in the Arctic under guidelines developed by the International Maritime Organization, as well as a welter of rules and benchmarks developed by other bodies. The polar code, being negotiated under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization, is intended to bring all those issues under the same agreement."
"DJ Lebanon's Oil, Gas Pre-Qualification Round Attracts 52 Firms",Norway,"DUBAI--Lebanon's pre-qualification round for its first oil and natural gas licenses in its Mediterranean coastal waters has attracted 52 oil firms from 25 countries including U.S. giant ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CVX) , and France's Total SA (TOT), the Petroleum Administration said. Fourteen firms applied to qualify as operators including Norway's Statoil ASA (STO), Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Italy's Eni SpA (E), the administration said on its website. It added that 39 firms applied for non-operator status including Korea National Oil Corp., or KNOC, Russia's OAO Rosneft (ROSN.RS) and Japan's Inpex Corp. (1605.TO). Lebanon, which passed an oil law in 2010 and formed a petroleum board last year, is opening prospects for exploration because it hopes sizeable discoveries could bring in funds to help cut its high level of government debt and to meet its domestic power demands. Geophysical data covering the exploration area in the eastern Mediterranean already indicate that the region contains several trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Last month, the country's energy minister, Gibran Bassil, said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires that the country plans to award the contracts in February next year. A list of qualified explorers, who will be allowed to do exploration work in waters close to Israel and Cyprus, will be issued April 21 and bids can be placed by May 2., Mr. Bassil said. Once qualified, companies will have to form consortia comprising at least three members to participate in the licensing round. Lebanon, a tiny Mediterranean country, faces economic and fiscal challenges that are contributing to its climbing public debt. Insecurity related to threats from across the borders of its neighbors Syria and Israel, and internal political and security instabilities that threaten foreign investments and tourism have all contributed to the country's fiscal hardships. By the end of July last year, Lebanon's gross public debt stood at $55.4 billion or 136.4% of the country's gross domestic product, according to the Association of Banks in Lebanon.

Rebirth of an inner-city island,Norway,"Once a dirty, no-go industrial zone, the island of Tjuvholmen in Oslo has been transformed into an ideal destination for a cultural city-break. Claire Wrathall reports Downtown Oslo has probably never struck you as a beach destination but on the southern edge of the little island of Tjuvholmen , a 10-minute walk across one of two bridges from Oslo's monumental 1930s City Hall, an arc of shingle and coarse sand shelves gently into the chill blue-black waters of the Oslofjord. Assuming you don't mind cold, you can swim here in summer and fish from the shore, too. Indeed an underwater reef has been cultivated in order to nurture a range of marine life, even lobsters. As Peter Groth, chief executive of Aspelin Ramm, one of the developers of the island, puts it, ""Twenty years ago, having a bathing beach here would have been completely unthinkable. It's fantastic that people can again go swimming in the Oslofjord."" Compared with the other Nordic capitals, Oslo has never been much of a tourist destination. Even the Oslo-based stockbroker-turned-bestselling crime novelist Jo Nesbo conceded recently that it was, until now, ""a rather boring town"". But this year there are two compelling reasons to visit the Norwegian capital. The obvious one is the programme of exhibitions devoted to the paintings of Edvard Munch, the 150th anniversary of whose birth falls in December. The other is the near-complete transformation of Tjuvholmen. Until the start of the millennium, the islet was a dirty, noisy, no-go industrial area, much as most of the city's waterfront had been until the 1980s, when Norway's newfound oil wealth began to flow into the capital, prompting the launch of a stillongoing project called Fjord City, intended to reclaim and renew its docklands and port area. As far as tourism is concerned, its signal achievement to date has probably been the Opera House that opened in 2008, a superb, white marble-clad structure of sloping planes that seems to rise out of the water like an iceberg. If its exterior is sensational, its interiors are more stunning still. That year, work also began on the transformation of Tjuvholmen into what Groth calls ""a living town within the city"", a place of shops, restaurants, galleries, apartments, abundant public art and a 90m-high glass observation tower that vaguely resembles a hypodermic syringe and from which there are views across the city, the fjord and its 40-odd islands. So far, so interesting. But last autumn, Oslo's major contemporary art collection, the Astrup Fearnley Museum , relocated to an arresting building on the island: three discrete structures designed by Renzo Piano, unified by a great arcing roof intended to echo the sails of the yachts in the adjacent marina. It is thanks to the museum that you approach the beach via a sculpture garden with works by among others, Louise Bourgeois, Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor, Ellsworth Kelly and Franz West, whose giant quasi-nautical installation of an anchor, lifebuoy and coiled rope stands where the sand starts. Then, earlier this year, a hotel opened next door, putting the island firmly on the radar of tourists considering an art-themed city-break. Its name, The Thief , harks back to the island's former reputation as a place overrun with crooks ( tjuv means thief in Norwegian), rather than the expense of a weekend here, because though Oslo can be eye-wateringly pricey, the hotel's rates are not unreasonable. Especially given the very high quality of its rooms, which are elegantly furnished with dark wood walls, Antonio Citterio chairs and desirable Scandinavian textiles, and technologically well-equipped with Samsung Galaxy tablets, motion-sensitive lighting, Geneva sound systems and Nespresso machines. Still, I hope the name doesn't tempt fate. ""There isn't another hotel anywhere with an art collection as highly insured,"" a passing staff member quipped, as I peered at a Peter Blake hanging in a corridor. Oslo is, after all, where, one Sunday in 2004, armed robbers casually removed Munch's ""Madonna"" and ""The Scream"" from walls in the Munch Museum. The Thief is filled with seriously good work. There's a crouching Antony Gormley by the entrance, a Warhol in the restaurant and an enormous Richard Prince (from the ""Cowboys"" series) dominates reception. Each lift has a different blinking computer animation, commissioned from Julian Opie. Though the works I most appreciated were the ones in my room: a stormy abstract etching by Ornulf Opdahl, within sight of the blissfully comfortable bed, and the compelling timelapse video installation that was playing on the television when I checked in: a plate of fruit, arranged and lit like a Dutch vanitas painting, that decomposes over a period of perhaps five minutes. It's by Sam Taylor-Wood, I learned when I inquired, one of eight video works available on every TV. Some of the art belongs to the hotel's co-owners, the brothers Olav and Frederik Selvaag, while the rest is on loan from Astrup Fearnley, and will change periodically, according to the eye of the hotel's curator, Sune Nordgren, latterly the director both of the Baltic gallery in Gateshead, England, and Oslo's National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design. The transformation of Tjuvholmen should be complete next year, but already it feels like a place with its own identity, thanks in part to the fact that 25 architectural practices have been involved in designing its various buildings, which gives the impression that it has grown organically. Along with a handful of commercial art galleries and some alluring shops, there's a supermarket and proper bakery, which reinforce the sense that the island is a community, and even on a snowy evening, its bars and restaurants were buzzing. Certainly there's no shortage of modishly designed places to eat: Onda, right on the water; the fish specialist Tjuvholmen Sjomagasin; and Bolgen & Moi, which has an interior by Snohetta (the local practice behind the opera house and the 9/11 Memorial Museum pavilion in New York), as well as a mural and some collages by Magne Furuholmen, whom readers of a certain age may recognise as Mags from 1980s pop sensation A-ha. Today he's a major player on the Oslo art scene, the subject of a 400-page tome found, among a selection of art books, in every room at The Thief, having created the installation that Al Gore unveiled in 2007 at the nearby Nobel Peace Centre (another institution worth visiting, incidentally, not least for the Chris Ofili murals in its restaurant, Alfred). That said, guests could do a lot worse than eat at The Thief itself - chef Kari Innera (a protégée of Marco Pierre White), who presides over its restaurant, Fru K, has created a fascinating menu of rarefied dishes based on typical Norwegian ingredients (whitefish roe, pickled mushrooms, hearty cuts of North Sea fish, white and brown cheeses) and unexpected combinations. A starter of scallops, cured lamb and tapioca in a strong mushroom broth was a revelation. But then Oslo is full of surprises and unlikely juxtapositions, none more extraordinary somehow than that a once-grim industrial enclave should now have at its heart a beach you can actually bathe from. Rooms at The Thief (thethief.com) are from Nkr1,890 (£215) Edvard Munch: 150 years While the art on Tjuvholmen is contemporary, the rest of Oslo is going mad for Edvard Munch on the 150th anniversary of his birth. Here are best places in and around the city to see his work: National Gallery The optimum spot to appreciate Munch's genius right now is Room T of the National Gallery, which contains 17 of his greatest works, including ""The Girls on the Pier"", ""The Dance of Life"", ""The Sick Child"" and of course ""The Scream"". From June 2 to October 13, the museum will stage the most ambitious exhibition of his work yet: 220 paintings and a near-complete reconstruction of the ""Reinhardt Frieze"" (commissioned by theatre director Max Reinhardt for the Deutsches Theater in Berlin). www.nasjonalmuseet.no[http://www.nasjonalmuseet.no] Munch Museum Its collection runs to 1,100 paintings by the artist (along with more than 20,000 drawings and prints), highlights from which will be on display this summer. There's also an eclectic programme of Munch-inspired concerts from June 7, curated by the hip and prodigiously versatile Norwegian trumpeter Tine Thing Helseth. www.munch.museum.no[http://www.munch.museum.no]; www.tineatmunch.com[http://www.tineatmunch.com] Ekeberg The vantage point where Munch painted ""The Scream"" can be found in Ekeberg park, four miles southeast of the centre. As Sue Prideaux noted in her definitive biography (Yale, 2005), ""What looks like a road in the painting was in fact a path, and the railing is a safety railing, though it looks like a bridge. It does not look very different today if one blanks out the industry round the docks."" There's a restaurant in the park, a functionalist masterpiece designed in 1927 and a good stop for a lunch of open shrimp sandwiches or various sorts of cured herring. www.ekebergrestauranten.com[http://www.ekebergrestauranten.com] Asgardstrand Munch had many homes during his 80-year life, but only one is open to the public (May to September): a modest rust-coloured 18th-century wooden fisherman's cottage that he bought in 1897 at Asgardstrand on the western edge of the Oslofjord, 60 miles south of the capital. Preserved as it would have looked during the dozen or so summers he lived here, it's been a museum since 1947; an evocative place in a village where certain trees, houses and boulders remain just as he painted them in ""The Girls on the Pier"" and ""The Storm"". www.munchshus.no[http://www.munchshus.no] Hotel Continental The bar of this hotel, near the National Theatre on Stortingsgaten, is home to a collection of original Munch woodcuts, lithographs and etchings.

Arctic move for Norway,Norway,"OSLO: Norway has taken a major step towards opening up an environmentally sensitive Arctic area to oil and gas exploration. The country’s ruling Labour Party has given the go-ahead for an impact study in the picturesque Lofoten Islands, above the Arctic Circle. The area had been off limits because it is home to the world’s richest cod stocks, with environmental groups and the tourism industry opposed to any development."
OASIS TOWNS CLAMOR FOR JOBS IN SHADOW OF AL-QAIDA,Norway,"ALGIERS -- Amar Kouiten's life has fallen apart since he lost his job last year as machine operator at an Algerian gas-liquification plant. His wife left him and took their two children to her parents' home. Kouiten, 36, joined a group of unemployed workers and began organizing protests in Ouargla province, where clashes with police left 40 people injured on April 10. ""We've really had enough of all this,"" he said in an interview, explaining that he only has enough money to eat once a day. ""All we want is the right to have a job."" Rising unemployment is sparking unprecedented unrest in the southern oasis towns in Algeria, the third-largest gas supplier to the European Union. It comes when the authorities are already tightening security after a January attack by militants linked to al- Qaida in Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, at the An Amenas gas plant that killed 38 foreign workers and amid preparations for elections next year. The government is ""aware of two possible future dangers: escalation of the protests and AQIM taking benefit of something that explodes,"" said I. William Zartman, professor emeritus of international studies at Johns Hopkins University. Below the oasis towns is the desert, home to most of nation's oil and gas reserves. Algeria produces about 1.2 million barrels of oil a day, pumped mainly by state-run Sonatrach, London-based BP, Norway's Statoil of Norway and ENI of Italy. The industry provides the government with about 98 percent of its revenue. ""The instability in the south is definitely something the authorities are worrying about in the run-up to elections,"" Riccardo Fabiani, a North Africa analyst at Eurasia Group, said in a telephone interview from London. ""It could threaten the cash cow of this regime."" Until now, the south has remained largely free of the sporadic protests over living conditions that erupted in the north and east before and after the Arab Spring that toppled rulers in neighboring Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. The worsening of security in the south has curbed job opportunities for the majority of people in the area who depend on cross-border trade, selling handicrafts and tourism, said Mahmad Saib Musette, head of research at the Algiers-based Center of Applied Economy for Development. ""This is one of the main reasons of the current unrest in the south,"" he said. ""The international companies need highly skilled laborers, who can't be found there."" The violence of the protests has been tempered by memories of the civil war in the 1990s, sparked by the military's decision to annul elections that Islamist parties were winning. As many as 200,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict, while thousands of northerners fled to the south, according to Algerian authorities. ""Algerians are scared stiff of the memory of the 1990s when the Islamists took out their revenge on various parts of the population, and the government on the Islamists, and no one cared who they killed,"" Zartman said. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika 76, has responded to the unrest with increased police action and programs designed to assuage the anger. The government said it would make zero percent loans available to Algerians aged 20 to 40 who want to start small businesses, and require companies such as BP and Statoil to hire more people locally. Algeria's police force, the Directorate For National Security, announced plans to recruit 6,000 young people in eight southern provinces including Ouargla, Algiers-based El-Khabar newspaper reported today. With oil production declining for four consecutive years, the government's ability to buy off discontent is waning. Bouteflika, who came to office in 1999, hasn't announced if he will stand in the 2014 election. So far, the new measures aren't satisfying the unemployed. The government has sent envoys to the region to meet with protest leaders, who have insisted on direct talks with ministers in Algiers. Economic growth of 2.5 percent last year and a forecast of 3.4 percent this year won't reduce the jobless rate, according to the International Monetary Fund. Officially, unemployment in Algeria is 9 percent, and about 20 percent among youth. ""What the government is offering us is just slogans,"" said Kouiten, who's a member of the National Committee for the Defense of the Rights of the Unemployed. ""There is nothing concrete in there for us."""
B.C.'s 'plebiscite on prosperity',Norway,"On May 14, British Columbians face a Hobson's choice in their provincial election: Liberal leader Christy Clark is in trouble in her own riding and the NDP guy is wobbly in polls and should be. But voters must hold their noses and re-elect the Liberals (who are actually Conservatives) because it's the only pro-development party on the ballot. The NDP, everywhere, is a coalition of vested interests, posing as a party with broad appeal, and without free enterprise smarts. Anywhere this party runs, voters must reject it out of hand. This is no time to get even for the B.C. Liberal sales tax fiascoor to send a message to Ottawa. This is an unusually important vote for this province and for all Canadians. In fact, this is an ""existential"" moment for Canada. If the NDP's Adrian Dix wins power in such a strategically important and rich jurisdiction such as this one - a keystone within the Canadian resource economy -B.C. voters will have chosen economic decline. This is as important as Quebec's referendums and yet this has not been acknowledged in the lead up. British Columbia and Vancouver (and Canada) would find themselves, if anti-development attitudes become its governance model, bypassed in terms of future growth. New pipelines and railways carrying oil, commodities and freight can be, and will be, diverted through Seattle, eastward or up to Valdez if necessary. The world does not owe British Columbians a living, and the world isn't providing much of one for the province either at this point. Some talk about the future prospects of Vancouver's Hollywood North or Silicon Valley North, but these are myths. The place has only three sustainable economic upsides, apart from operating nursing homes for its disproportionately senior population: developing energy resources, developing mining resources and expanding its critical logistics role and sector. B.C. has the infrastructure and geographic good luck to be where imports and exports transit via pipelines, airlines, ships, rail and roads. Vancouver's financial services head offices left with the closure of its stock exchange and the city has fewer head offices than Calgary with less business travel. Instead of talking about how to maintain living standards, or improve them, much of this electioneering has been petty and a contest between which oil and natural gas pipeline proposals and which port enlargements are unacceptable. Political correctness here has become how to forestall or avert economic opportunities, not how to grab them with the least environmental impact and greatest public good. The place is going from NIMBY, not in my backyard, to BANANA, build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone. Politicians and other interest groups just pile on against any means of transporting the oil sands through the province. Next, one can expect, will be a pile on against the transport of wheat, potash, nickel, beef, soybeans and manufactured goods. This has resulted in B.C. per capita incomes of $47,579 in 2011 versus Alberta or Saskatchewan's of plus $70,000 a year. The NDP opposition's economic development model consists of turning the place into a gigantic, empty park populated only by those retirees who can afford to buy the most expensive real estate in North America. The Liberals, who should make a solid case, have stumbled and bumbled along. But the economic issues at stake on May 14 are important to understand: 1. Energy in general, and Alberta's oil sands in particular, are the single most important cornerstone of the Canadian economy, bigger than autos, manufacturing, mining, forestry, tour-ism or financial services. Planeloads leave B.C. every day to take workers and suppliers to lucrative jobs in its oil sands. Landlocked Alberta needs a pipeline or two to the Pacific coast, a railway to Valdez, or all of the above. If voters are worried about shoddy work, or Chinese oil tankers off the coast, then the debate should be about how government can insure against risks, not how to stop such projects. If voters are worried that Alberta is getting all the money, then government should insist on revenue sharing. If First Nations are upset their claims are still in limbo, then government should settle because trillions of dollars are at stake in economic activity. 2. B.C.'s biggest upside is natural gas reserves if they are monetized. To do so requires the building of up to four pipelines, plants and port facilities to gather and liquify the stuff for export around the world. The province could become the Norway of Canada and only a government solidly committed to making that happen should be elected. Mining must be a priority. 3. British Columbians must disavow themselves of any notion that there are alternatives, or that their beautiful scenery and tourism will become their growth story in future. Tourism has collapsed across Canada and, even if it could be kick-started, the sector is as energy-intensive as heavy industry. Cruise ships, ski lifts, fishing camps, over-heated hotels in Whistler, ferries, cars, buses, luxury private ships, rail links and fishing boats rely on gobs of Alberta oil. 4. B.C.'s biggest shadow export industry - marijuana and other narcotics - is also in trouble. By 2002, its revenues were larger than forestry exports and grown to the point where Pentagon drones patrol the region in an attempt to intercept truckloads or planeloads of narcotics that take off from northern runways or from drug centers like Trail or Nelson. (In 2006, the RCMP's ""drug Situation report"" estimated marijuana production was between 1,399 and 3,498 tonnes. At $8-million per tonne street value today, that totals up to $27.98-billion, more than vehicle and auto parts exports in 2011.) This industry faces disaster, not because of drones, but because the neighbours and customers - Washington and Oregon - voted in 2012 to legalize marijuana. 5. retirement havens have been big business but this will disappear because of high taxation and excessive real estate prices in British Columbia. Property values, pushed artificially by hot money from Asia, are also why the number of head offices shrinks every year. Few can afford to relocate there. That, in a nutshell, is the B.C. economicl and scape and is why the May 14 election will not be a vote so much as a plebiscite on prosperity versus poverty. Hopefully, the majority will vote Liberal and hopefully that party's leadership will stiffen its resolve, then take principled stands to create wealth for all and execute the process with integrity, efficiency, responsibility and smarts."
"Icy Arctic is economic, security hot spot As polar region thaws, global rivalries and lucrative resources spur race to grab access.",Norway,"WASHINGTON • The icy Arctic is emerging as a global economic hot spot — and one that is becoming a security concern for the U.S. as world powers jockey to tap its vast energy resources and stake out unclaimed territories. Diplomats from eight Arctic nations, including Secretary of State John Kerry, will meet next week over how to protect the thawing region as its waterways increasingly open to commercial shipping traffic. U.S. officials estimate the Arctic holds 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of undiscovered gas deposits. Until recently, however, the lucrative resources that could reap hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue were frozen over and unreachable. But global warming has melted sea ice to levels that have given rise to what experts describe as a kind of gold rush scramble to the Arctic. On Friday, President Barack Obama announced a new U.S. strategy for the Arctic, calling the region “an amazing place” and maintaining a need among nations to protect its fragile environment and keep it free of conflict. “An undisciplined approach to exploring new opportunities in this frontier could result in significant harm to the region, to our national security interests, and to the global good,” the 13-page strategy concluded. The Arctic is getting hotter faster than any part of the globe. Experts predict the region will be free of sea ice during the summer within about 20 years. Sea ice is important because it keeps the rest of the world cooler, and some scientific studies suggest that its melting may be indirectly connected to the extreme weather in the United States and elsewhere in the past few years, changing global weather patterns, including the track of Superstorm Sandy. The environmental changes could threaten not only polar bears, whales, seals and indigenous peoples, but also islands and low-lying areas from Florida to Bangladesh. Yet the melting may be a boon for business. New shipping routes could provide faster and cheaper passageway for worldwide exports and cargo hauling, including everything from food and electronics to cars and military equipment. And it could also bolster global tourism with cruises in the region’s around-the-clock summertime daylight. But the big prize is the vast and untapped supply of oil, gas, minerals and precious metals that are believed to be buried in the Arctic. Already, there is a global race to get energy out of areas that in the past were locked up in ice and frozen ground. In 2007, a Russian research ship placed a Russian flag on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole in a symbolic gesture. And last year, China joined Russia, Denmark and Canada and the United States in the competition, sending its first icebreaker ship through the Arctic — even though China doesn’t abut Arctic territory. Economic rivalries in the Arctic have made the area a burgeoning security priority. Arctic nations are eyeing sending additional military forces to the region to maintain stability on the seas and protect against maritime crime, according to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service. Russia is planning to train and equip a brigade of military troops specifically for Arctic warfare, and Canada is revitalizing its Arctic fleet with $33 billion to build 28 ships over the next 30 years. Norway, Denmark and the U.S. are all expanding military command centers and operations within the Arctic. The U.S. Navy is nearing the end of a five-year plan, set in 2009, to plot out what path it will take in the Arctic. That may include policing waterways and interdicting pirates as it does in warmer waters. And the Coast Guard’s small Arctic ice-breaking fleet is getting a much-needed boost: One of its three ships is about to be relaunched after being docked for major repairs. Another ship is already fully operational, and the third is out of service, officials said. Next year, the Navy and Coast Guard will draw up plans to have an enduring presence in the Arctic and be able to run search and rescue operations there, Navy chief Adm. Jonathan Greenert said in congressional testimony last month. The military ramp-up is a piece of what experts say is an inevitable political competition that will grow in the Arctic as it opens."
"Arctic Council admits China, six others as observers",Norway,"The Arctic Council, at a meeting Wednesday in northern Sweden, granted permanent observer status to China and six others, in a powerful signal of the polar region's growing international importance. Foreign ministers of the eight-member council, including US Secretary of State John Kerry, made the decision at a biennial gathering, which took place in the town of Kiruna. The other countries given permanent observer status were India, Italy, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, adding to the geographic reach of the once-obscure group which promotes cooperation on environmental protection, oil and mineral exploitation, shipping, tourism and fishing. ""It strengthens the position of the Arctic Council on the international scene,"" said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, who chaired the meeting. The Arctic Council received an application for permanent EU observer status ""affirmatively"", but deferred a final decision on the issue. ""It will be implemented once certain questions have been tackled, but the decision means that the EU already now can act as an observer,"" Bildt's spokesman Erik Zsiga told AFP. The nature of the Council's reservations were not disclosed. But Canada, which took over the Arctic Council chairmanship on Wednesday, is known to be at loggerheads with the EU over a European ban on products derived from the seal hunt, which the EU says is conducted using inhumane methods. Permanent observers have no voting rights in the Council, but unlike ad hoc observers they are automatically invited to the group's meetings. ""It signals openness, and it reflects the fact that many countries outside the Arctic area also have legitimate interests in the development of the region,"" Danish Foreign Minister Villy Soevndal said in a statement. Rising temperatures have boosted international interest in the polar region, as melting ice causes transport routes to open up and makes hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. The Arctic is believed to hold some 90 billion barrels of oil and 30 percent of the world's yet-to-be discovered natural gas resources. ""When it comes to Singapore for example it is very clear that it is shipping issues they are interested in, the same thing is true for India,"" Bildt told Swedish Radio. China has opened an Arctic research centre in Norway's far north Svalbard region, and in mid-2012 the first Chinese ice breaker travelled from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the Arctic along the Russian coast, a 40 percent shorter route to Europe. ""China values the scientific research and environmental protection (work) of the Arctic Council,"" foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists in Beijing on Wednesday, before the council announced taking on China as a permanent observer. ""(It) has always supported the principles and purposes of the Arctic Council,"" he said. Bildt said yet more countries were lining up to apply for observer status, including Turkey and Mongolia. Global warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as elsewhere on the planet, Bildt noted. ""The changing climate... creates new opportunities, not least for the Arctic states,"" he said. ""These, however, are also fraught with new challenges, and threats that must be confronted."" The Arctic Council is composed of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. A total of 13 countries now hold observer status, after Wednesday's decision. Meanwhile, Greenland boycotted Wednesday's meeting after Sweden refused to accept its representatives on an equal footing with other members, its prime minister said. ""Until Sweden took over the chairmanship in 2011, Denmark had three chairs at the table with a representative for each part of the Danish Commonwealth,"" Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond told Greenland daily Sermistiaq. Arctic Greenland, along with the Faeroe Islands, is part of the Danish Commonwealth. Under a home rule agreement with Denmark, Greenland has full control of its raw materials and internal affairs, while decisions on defence and international affairs reside with Denmark. ""When the Swedes took over, the commonwealth was only given one chair and Greenland and the Faeroe Islands had to sit behind and not directly in the negotiations,"" Hammond added, saying she feared that a new Canadian chairmanship would adopt the same principle. bur/po/ph/gk"
Canada pushes development as it takes over Arctic Council,Norway,"Canada said Wednesday it will promote unprecedented industrial development in the far north as it takes over the helm of the Arctic Council, while activists called for a ban on oil drilling. Leona Aglukkaq, minister for northern affairs, told a teleconference from Sweden: ""With the help of our Arctic Council partners, we will focus on creating economic development and sustainable northern communities."" It is a priority embraced by all Arctic Council members, she said, adding that it must be done in an ""environmentally sustainable manner."" The intergovernmental forum -- composed of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States -- aims to promote cooperation on environmental protection, oil and mineral exploitation, shipping, tourism and fishing. At a biennial gathering, which took place in the town of Kiruna, Sweden, Canada took over the rotating two-year chairmanship of the group, which is at a crossroads. Rising temperatures have boosted international interest in the polar region, as melting ice opens up shipping routes and makes hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. Global warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic than elsewhere on the planet, and many fear not only devastating impacts of warming but also from an influx of people and industry on the pristine environment, wildlife and Inuit culture. Aglukkaq's declaration came as Greenpeace protested outside Canada's parliament to press Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government to ban oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, which is believed to be rich in hydrocarbons. The activist group also called for an uninhabited area around the North Pole to be declared a sanctuary, to be protected from large-scale industrial development, such as oil drilling and industrial fishing. ""We will not stand by and let the Harper government use the next two years to advance its destructive industrial agenda at the Arctic Council,"" said Greenpeace's Christy Ferguson. ""The Arctic Council should be a forum for preventing environmental disasters like oil spills and fighting climate change -- not facilitating them."" Aglukkaq countered that northern residents ""want development."" The minister noted that mines or other industrial projects must be approved ""largely by aboriginal peoples"" as part of land claims agreements with the Canadian government. amc/rcw"
DJ Scottish Government: UK Govts Have Held Back Scotland's Economy,Norway,"LONDON--The Scottish government hit back at claims from London that independence will damage the country's economic prospects in a report Tuesday that criticizes U.K. governments for holding back the Scottish economy and squandering its resources. The report, called 'Scotland's Economy: The Case for Independence,' is also deeply critical of U.K. governments for failing to establish an oil fund from the revenues from the North Sea oil fields. ""Had we had responsibility of our own oil resources for the last four decades we could have invested in a fund for future generations of the kind which Norway has and which is now worth around GBP90,000 [$136,493] per person in that country,"" said Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's deputy first minister and a lawmaker in the pro-independence Scottish National Party. The Scottish government's report comes a day after the U.K. Treasury published a report that said an independent Scotland would have an exceptionally large banking sector, compared with the size of the rest of its economy, making it vulnerable to financial shocks and putting Scottish taxpayers at significant risk in the event of the country being hit by another banking crisis. The Treasury report, commissioned by the U.K. government, estimated that an independent Scotland would have banking assets worth more than 1,250% of Scottish gross domestic product. The reports come as campaigning on both sides of the referendum debate intensifies ahead of Sept. 18, 2014--the day when Scots will vote on whether to stay in the U.K. or go it alone as an independent nation. As the date draws nearer, the London-based U.K. government, which is in favor of maintaining the 300-year-old union between Scotland and the rest of the U.K., is pointing out the economic risks and uncertainty that it believes an independent Scotland would create. By contrast, the semiautonomous Scottish government is campaigning to convince Scots that their small nation, which is rich in natural resources such as oil and gas from the North Sea, would be better off if it cut its ties to the rest of the U.K. Ms. Sturgeon Tuesday said that despite Scotland having a ""the vast array of human, financial and natural resources"" the country wasn't reaching its full economic potential. ""Scotland has a wealth of resources in the areas of life sciences, creative industries, ICT, oil and gas, renewable energy, food and drink, manufacturing, financial services and tourism--and with the full powers of independence the Scottish government would have the powers to do much more,"" Ms. Sturgeon said. ""The policies pursued by [the] Westminster Government are not optimal for Scotland and are not fit for Scottish circumstances."" In particular, the report says the decision by the U.K. government to cut capital spending--namely spending on infrastructure, such as roads and schools--as part of the austerity program it has embarked on since the financial crisis has resulted in 19,000 fewer jobs in Scotland. The report also criticizes the U.K. government for allowing income inequality to grow in the U.K., for its decision to concentrate economic activity in London, and for pursuing austerity measures rather than focusing on growing the economy. ""Scotland can more than afford to be a successful independent country,"" Ms. Sturgeon said. ""The question everyone must ask themselves is whether we can afford not to be independent given the scale of economic mismanagement by Westminster.""

Scotland Counters U.K.'s Claims On Independence,Norway,"LONDON—The Scottish government hit back at claims from London that Scotland will be worse off as an independent country, issuing a report Tuesday that charges successive U.K. governments with holding back the Scottish economy and squandering resources. In ""Scotland's Economy: The Case for Independence,"" the government in Edinburgh also claimed that London's policies since the financial crisis began in 2008 have resulted in 19,000 fewer jobs in Scotland. The report follows a series of reports the U.K. government has been releasing ahead of the referendum on independence on Sept. 18, 2014. On Monday, a Treasury report said that an independent Scotland would have an exceptionally large banking sector, compared with the size of the rest of its economy. That could make it vulnerable to financial shocks and put Scottish taxpayers at significant risk in the event of another banking crisis. The Treasury report estimated that an independent Scotland would have banking assets worth more than 1,250% of Scottish gross domestic product—a much higher level than Iceland or Cyprus had when their banking crises hit. As the date for the vote draws nearer, the U.K. government, which is in favor of maintaining the 300-year-old union, is pointing out the economic risks and uncertainty that it believes an independent Scotland would face. By contrast, the semiautonomous Scottish government is campaigning to convince Scots that their small land, which is rich in natural resources such as oil and gas from the North Sea, would be better off if it cut its ties to the rest of the U.K. Speaking on BBC radio on Tuesday, Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister and leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, highlighted the country's economic strength, saying it had been a net contributor to the U.K. Treasury for years. He said that Scottish oil and gas reserves, though finite, would last ""a long time."" Mr. Salmond defended his plan for an independent Scotland to continue using sterling as its currency, saying that would also benefit England, Wales and Northern Ireland because Scottish energy exports should prevent the currency from significantly weakening. ""I think it makes sense to share a currency with a large trading partner and neighbor,"" he said. ""The rest of the U.K. would enjoy the protection that oil and gas gives the sterling balance of payments."" How North Sea oil and gas resources would be shared between an independent Scotland and the rest of the U.K. hasn't yet been established. The head of the anti-independence campaign, former U.K. chancellor of the exchequer Alistair Darling, said a currency union would put Scotland in a ""straitjacket"" because the remaining members of the U.K. would want some control over its tax and spending policies. Some economists say a lack of cross-border fiscal oversight was a major flaw in the design of the euro zone, and contributed to the continuing crisis in that currency bloc. Last month, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said it was unlikely the rest of the U.K. would agree to form a currency zone with an independent Scotland. The report issued Tuesday criticized the U.K. for failing to establish a reserve fund with revenue from the North Sea oil fields. ""Had we had responsibility of our own oil resources for the last four decades we could have invested in a fund for future generations of the kind which Norway has,"" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's Deputy First Minister and a lawmaker in the pro-independence Scottish National Party, said in the report. She estimated that the Norwegian fund is now worth around £90,000, or $137,000, per person in Norway. Ms. Sturgeon said that Scotland wasn't reaching its full economic potential, despite ""a wealth of resources"" in areas such as life sciences, creative industries, oil and gas, financial services and tourism. ""With the full powers of independence the Scottish government would have the powers to do much more,"" she said. The policies pursued in London ""are not optimal for Scotland and are not fit for Scottish circumstances.""

""Scotland can more than afford to be a successful independent country,"" Ms. Sturgeon said. ""We have infinite respect for the ability of the English people to govern themselves,"" Mr. Salmond said in the interview Tuesday.

"WILD BLUE YONDER; EXPLORE HISTORIC BERGEN AND THEN HEAD FOR NORWAY'S DRAMATIC, AWE-INSPIRING FJORDS",Norway,"Gateways tend to be things you wander through without dawdling, without expectation, on the way to somewhere else. So I was wary on arrival in Bergen to see posters describing Norway's second-largest city as 'the gateway to the fjords', even though they were high on the agenda during a short, but irresistibly sweet, trip to a part of the world about which we know far too little. Mind you, I'd heard the joke about the tourist in Bergen who asked a local lad: 'Does it always rain here?' To which the boy replied: 'I don't know, I'm only seven.' Sure enough it was drizzling as we arrived in town (a sort of Scottish drizzle, but with an hour's time difference). We checked into the Radisson Blu Hotel along with a few hundred others who were there for a medical conference of some sort or other. No, not exactly a boutique hotel experience, but one that plonked us bang on Bryggen, the famous and much photographed wharf with its higgledy- piggledy wooden buildings that rightly have made it on to Unesco's World Heritage List. Then, as we started exploring, we realised this particular gateway is one where dawdling is very much in order. Bergen is perfect to negotiate on foot. Safe, hospitable, self-assured, it's no surprise that easyJet has just added this former capital city to its roster of Scandinavian destinations. Quaint doesn't do Bergen justice, though it does have a toy town air about it with its immaculately clean streets and unthreatening, unedgy vibe. And here's a sweeping generalisation: Norwegians seem effortlessly (dread phrase) 'comfortable in their own skins' — and comfortably off, too. The oil rigs in the north of the country keep the economy nicely lubricated while making the likelihood of EU membership as remote as ever. That's good news for Norwegians when they take their krones abroad, but not so good when the rest of us bring our pounds to Bergen. Make that £7 for a beer, £10 for a glass of wine. Famous Norwegians? Tricky. There are lots of explorers and plenty of champion skiers. There's the former Manchester United footballer Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the playwright Henrik Ibsen and the composer Edvard Greig, who came from Bergen and whose home is now a museum and concert venue. For sure, it's the country's landscape that is the real star. And it's certainly easily accessible from Bergen. We got an 8.40am train for the popular all-day trip known breezily as Norway In A Nutshell. This unhurried, but substantial tour starts with two spectacular hours on Northern Europe's highest railway to Myrdal, where the station staff wear Postman Pat hats and merrily blow whistles. From Myrdal you switch trains and drop down to the famous little port of Flam through snowy mountains and past dozens of waterfalls. I expected to see Julie Andrews and her Von Trapp brood skipping beside the rickety track. And then, when we stopped at the Kjosfossen waterfall, everyone spilled out onto a platform 2,400 ft above sea level and two women in flowing red dresses appeared from behind a giant rock and began dancing seductively. Apparently, they were dressed as mythical forest creatures called Huldras and their dresses were disguising cow's tails. If they could lure a man, their tails would drop off and they could return to normal life in the city. A good summer job for budding ballerinas. Our return to normal life was an abrupt one in Flam, where a huge cruise ship occupied the main dock. This is cruise central in summer, so you just have to regard Flam — with its micro-brewery, museum, touristy restaurants and souvenir shops — as a fjord hub. For us, it was where we hopped on board a boat and chugged all the way to Gudvangen via the Aurlandsfjord and the narrower Naeroyfjord, both magnificent, both virtually unsullied by the trappings of 21st-century living. At one point on this two-hour cruise, I popped my head into the captain's cabin to ask a question and he invited me in. He was a dead ringer for Captain Bird's Eye. 'Do you mind if I do?' he asked, picking up a packet of tobacco and cigarette papers. 'Not at all,' I said. 'Do you mind if I steer the ship?' I asked a few minutes later. 'Not at all,' he said. And so, for the next ten minutes, I was at the helm, steering a perfect line through some of the most perfect waters in the world. It was only later that the captain explained we had been on auto-pilot all along. After arriving in Gudvangen, we took a bus to Voss. The route included the Stalheimskleiva road, with its notorious hairpin bends that make San Francisco's Lombard Street look like child's play. I concentrated on admiring the gushing water crashing over the rocks on either side of us, rather than imagining our bus crashing into the rocks and joining the gushing water. While waiting for our final train back to Bergen from Voss, I bought a rug made from reindeer, then followed that up later with fillet of reindeer at the excellent Bryggeloft & Stuene restaurant (founded in 1910) on the wharf. After rounding off the night with a couple of Aquavits, the local liqueur made from potatoes, we were ready to sleep-walk back to the hotel. Next morning we took the funicular up to a wonderful vantage point high above the city: a busy port, a purposeful town, mountains, bridges and water everywhere. We gulped the crisp air and marvelled at it all. We had read that 90 per cent of all the buildings burned down in the devastating fire of 1702, but brave Bergen bounced back — and today this charming, unpretentious city is far more than a mere gateway to somewhere else.

Alla-fjord!; A rail trip through Norway offers a scenic and grown-up getaway,Norway,"The train station in Bergen is difficult to get lost in. It has just four tracks, housed under a high arched steel and glass roof that leaves the trains neither completely indoors nor outdoors. A retro cool neon sign greets visitors to the small city that was once Norway's capital, founded in the 11th century, and now known as the gateway to the fjords. The last time I was in Europe for any length of time it was close to 20 years ago; I was 19 and backpacking with a Eurail pass. My partner Steve, who is here with me, did a similar trip at a similar time, and while we didn't know each other then, we both followed the prevailing wisdom among backpackers, which was to avoid northern europelikeatravellers'-cheque-eating plague. Times have changed just a little since those days (i.e. I no longer work at a bowling alley), so we set our sights on Norway for a new, more grown-up rail trip. Our plan is to travel from Bergen on the west coast, through Flåm in the middle, to Oslo on the east coast. It's a relatively short trip, about 14 hours in total, but we'll take our time getting across via Norway in a Nutshell, a scenic, non-guided rail tour. Arriving in Bergen, I can't help but feel I've been deposited into a storybook. The city is tucked between the sea and seven low mountains, one of which looks close enough to touch as we approach our hotel. The houses nestled into its side look two-dimensional from this angle, the effect like a diorama. Our first full day here is unseasonably cold, but we make the most of it, wandering the city's narrow cobbled streets, admiring the colourful architecture. We warm up in the fish market, where vendors offer samples of hot soup. From here you can see across the harbour to Bergen's most famous area, Bryggen (Norwegian for wharf). Once the centre of the area's fish trade, it's now a UNESCO world heritage site. In the afternoon we take the popular Fløibanen funicular to the top of Fløyen, the downtown mountain, and admire panoramic views of the red-roofed houses, city squares and jagged shoreline. We're staying at the historic Grand Terminus hotel, directly across from the train station, so our morning commute is conveniently quick. The day's destination is Flåm, but we'll be going only as far as voss by train. The last leg of the 170 kilometre journey involves scenic detour, a ferry trip through the awesome Naeroyfjord. rising up from the narrow body of water on both sides are stunning cliffs that dwarf our small boat. The occasional settlement dots the shoreline, and gulls fly alongside the ferry, posing for the tourist paparazzi. Two and half hours, one traditional Norwegian pancake, and many photos later we arrive in Flåm, a tourist hamlet with a year-round population of 500. Nestled at the end of the Aurlandfjord, this is a jumping off point for outdoor activities including hiking and biking (trails are extensive, trips ranging from an afternoon to multiple days), as well as fjord safaris that allow visitors to get up close and personal with the landscape and local wildlife. We explore the area by car, visiting the Borgund stave church - these medieval structures were once found all over northwestern Europe, but nearly all that remain are in Norway. This one, intricate and black, does little to challenge that whole fairy tale vibe. (The country's smallest stave church is in nearby undredal, known for its cheese, where goats out-number humans five-to-one.) A highlight of our exploration is the Stegastein Lookout in Aurland. The fjord view from here is impressive, but so is the viewpoint. The curved wood and steel structure, which juts out 30 metres, 650 metres up, wouldn't look out of place in Frank Gehry's AGO. Our home for the night is the Fretheim hotel, built in the 1870s to cater to the Brits who liked to come here to hunt and fish. It's been significantly expanded since, and we're in the newer American wing, so named for the amenities included - items such as small shampoos and bathrobes that are not so common in Norwegian hotels. The people we've spoken to have characterized their countrymen and women as modest, without interest in ex-cess. Thanks to the discovery of oil in the late 1960s, Norway enjoys a very high standard of living, but the people here - traditionally farmers - still value simplicity. When it's time to depart for Oslo, we board a handsome green train that will take us through Norway's most famous stretch of track. The 20-kilometre route from Flåm to Myrdal is one of the steepest rail lines on earth, winding its way up the dramatic Flåm valley, through 20 tunnels (18 of them hand-dug). Norway's natural beauty is undeniably awe-inspiring, but I am also looking forward to some urban time. With a population of 585,000, Oslo has all the benefits of a city -art, neighbourhoods, public transit and good coffee top my list -but it's small enough to be walkable and easy to navigate. It is also, unsurprisingly, situated on a fjord. Oslofjord is 100 kilometres long and contains about 40 islands, which are popular with the locals in summer. This I learn over the loudspeaker on a fjord cruise to visit the museums on Bygdoy Peninsula, while enjoying the fact that museums here get a peninsula. We don't have time to see all five (there are many more elsewhere), so the plan is to beeline to the viking ship museum. having spent a week in Norway, we've seen surprisingly few viking references, save for the dolls in every gift shop. However, a spontaneous stop at the Kon Tiki museum en route turns out to be a good one. Thesmall museum is devoted to the fascinating Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl (the subject of Norway's recently Oscar nominated Kon Tiki), who most famously travelled 8,000 kilometres from South America to the Tuamotu Islands on a raft in the 1940s, just to prove that ancient peoples could have done the same thing. But the Viking ships were pretty cool also. Later, at Frogner Park, we admire the more than 200 nude sculptures by Gustav Vigeland. They are wonderful, though some are also quite bizarre, such as the consensus favourite, a man being attacked by babies, one of which he is kicking. A No. 12 bus takes us to Grünerløkka, a funky, laid back neighbourhood where boutiques, cafés and restaurants line the streets around its central square. Tim Wendelboe, a local micro coffee roaster provides the caffeine fuel for the afternoon. crossing a small river on foot we wander down to the new Vulkan development -an industrial area that's been revitalized with hotels, schools and the terrific Mathallen Food hall, where we stop for lunch. In a long building where bridge parts were once manufactured, food vendors sell gourmet goodies alongside cheese shops and sundries stores. One of the things I'd most looked forward to in coming to Oslo was its waterfront Opera house, but it took until our final night here to explore it. completed in 2007, the building, by innovative architecture firm Snøhetta, is also part work of art and part public space. Made of white marble and granite, the building is meant to resemble a glacier. visitors walk on top of the roof, which angles down until it's submerged in the ocean. At a late dusk hour we are among just a few people here. I look in the direction of the adjacent train station, where we'll exit the country tomorrow. I'm not sure I'm ready to go yet, but sometimes you've just got to make tracks. IF YOU GO GETTING THERE Air Canada offers connecting flights to Oslo and Bergen via Frankfurt, London or Copenhagen.

"Investment boom could result in cuts and unemployment, expert claims",Norway,"High oil prices may well drive an investment boom in an independent Scotland but other industries could suffer because of higher wages and costs, an economics professor will warn in Edinburgh today. And when there is an “inevitable"" downturn in energy prices, the boom will subside and be replaced by unemployment and severe spending cuts. The warning will be issued by Gordon Hughes, Professor of Economics at the University of Edinburgh, at a conference on the implications of independence for the Scottish economy. Professor Hughes says that under independence Scotland would be a “classic, small, open, resource-dependent country"" but with rather a poor location, which reduces the income earned from its resources, including farming and tourism as well as energy. He says: “Every country in Scotland’s position, even Norway, has suffered from some degree of Dutch Disease caused by the volatility of the energy market. (Dutch Disease refers to the negative consequences arising from large increases in a country’s income.) “The usual pattern is that high prices and returns generate an investment boom, which drives up wages and the costs of non-traded sectors — construction, services, etc. This undermines the viability of non-energy manufacturing activities, which close down or relocate. While Scotland remains part of the UK this effect is diffused over a much larger economy, but it would be acute when concentrated in Scotland. “When the downturn occurs, as inevitably it will, the boom is replaced by higher unemployment and a severe squeeze on the public finances."" Professor Hughes contends that it would be unwise to assume that energy prices will remain as high as they are now as they have historically moved in a cycle of lows and highs. He notes that the key lesson to be learned from the development of oil and gas fracking technology in America is that innovation can increase supplies, cutting prices and hence revenues to both the companies involved and the government. One of the remedies for this kind of energy-driven economic cycle is to build up a large sovereign wealth fund, as Norway has done with its oil resources, but Scotland would be starting from a much worse position than Norway did, he argues. “Norway has invested a large share of the rents generated by its oil and gas for more than 20 years, not only in its sovereign wealth fund but also by self-funding [through Statoil, the state-owned oil and gas company] the large capital investment required to develop the resources. “In contrast, Scotland has relied – and must continue to rely — upon external capital flows [through private oil and gas companies] to fund investment in the energy sector."" Scotland’s location also means that economic success will depend on the ability to export large amounts of electricity, gas and even oil to England. While it is argued that there is a strong mutual interest in maintaining integrated markets, Professor Hughes contends: “History tells us that when countries break up, then unified energy markets tend to weaken quite rapidly thereafter, with strong incentives to replace imports by domestic production."" “Similarly, is it really the case that an English government would treat renewable electricity generated in Scotland, whether from wind or marine resources, on a par with domestic renewables? Again, this view may be much too optimistic."" A Scottish Government spokesman said: “It is astonishing that Mr Hughes manages to turn Scotland’s immense energy resources, of which any country would be proud, into a negative for the economy.We have a responsibility to make sure our nation seizes this opportunity to create tens of thousands of new jobs and secure billions of pounds of investment in our economy."""

"Fortune favours the brave; The bold step of venturing overseas in a recession is reaping rewards for those who took the plunge, finds Richard Tyler",Norway,"Britain's economy contracted for an unprecedented sixth consecutive quarter in the autumn of 2009, marking the longest recession on record. ""We're facing the worst global financial crisis and recession in 60 years,"" Alistair Darling, the then chancellor, warned gloomily on 23 October. Aweek later, 100 miles up the M1 from Westminster, Lee Cottingham, executive chairman of Leicester-based Mark Group, was assessing the initial month of trading from his family firm's first international operations, in Australia. The contrast in fortunes could not have been sharper. The energy efficiency specialist, ranked No 1 on this year's fourth annual Sunday Times HSBC International Track 200, is one of seven companies in the league table's top 10 that grasped the nettle during the 2008 and 2009 recession. The likes of London's TBG (No 2), a social media advertising firm, and Luton's shipping security experts Protection Vessels International (No 3), also expanded rapidly overseas during this period. Cottingham, 38, said his international plans for Mark Group (see profile, right) had developed over the previous eight years of making homes, schools and offices more energy efficient in Britain. ""The timing to take the business overseas was coincidental with the downturn,"" he said, ""but the years of strong growth here were the creation of the means, and confidence, to venture farther afield."" As Dan Howlett from HSBC notes below, confidence built on the ability to assess risk and reward is one of the key characteristics of successful exporters. This year's growth stars are the 200 privately-owned companies with the fastestgrowing international sales over their latest two years of trading. On average, they increased sales 44% a year, with 34 companies achieving triple digit expansion. They collectively recorded £8.2bn in overseas sales, well over a third of their total revenues, and now employ more than 130,000 people, having added at least 31,000 jobs over the two year period. The majority make goods, from chassis for supersonic cars (Formaplex, No 45) to luxury kitchens (Canburg, No 28), and 44 companies class themselves as engineers, more than double the number on last year's league table. They include County Durham automotive precision engineer GT Group (No 74) and Gloucester industrial valve maker Severn Glocon (No 91). Most of these firms still see their main markets as Europe and the US. However, 88 are solely focused on one or more fastgrowing emerging market, such as China, Indonesia or Turkey. And more are now targeting these countries, with China, India and Brazil identified as having most potential. Nick Baird, from the government's trade promotion agency UK Trade &Investment;, calls on more companies to do the same on page 3. Cottingham at Mark Group advises aspiring exporters to do their homework. ""Fools rush in,"" he said. ""Make the time to talk to people who've done it, both those who have broken through and those who failed too."" And his tip for those seeking to emulate Mark Group's success? ""Really understand the USP you bring to the table and be prepared to adapt,"" he said. ""Success comes from the ability to foresee, adapt and embrace changes along the way. But do not confuse this with distraction: be focused on your objectives."" FAST TRACK The International Track 200, which ranks private British companies with the fastest-growing overseas sales, is produced by Fast Track, the Oxford firm that researches Britain's top-performing private companies and organises dinners for their owners and directors to network and meet its sponsors. For full ranking criteria, see page 2. 1 MARK GROUP Energy efficiency specialist 513.39% With the cost of heating and running our homes rising each year, energy efficiency has become something of a hot topic. Energy companies, spurred on by government regulation and subsidies, are keen to help, promoting the benefits of a range of measures from cavity wall insulation to efficient boilers and micro-generation systems that can supply a certain amount of the energy used by your home or business. This is where Mark Group comes in. Founded in 1974, the Leicester-based company's 2,500 staff help to make more than 7,000 homes, businesses and schools more energy efficient each week. They install loft and cavity wall insulation, but also provide more technically demanding products and services such as external wall insulation for older buildings, air source heat pumps, wind turbines, solar hot water systems and photovoltaic panels that generate electricity from the sun. The company says that it has helped over 2m customers save money on their energy bills since it was founded. Led by Lee Cottingham, 38, (pictured) the son of the group's original founder, Mark Group began its international expansion in 2009, when it set up a subsidiary in Sydney, Australia. It is now active in five Australian territories. In 2010 it entered the American market and two years later launched Mark Group USA in Philadelphia. Business secured in Australia and America has provided much of the growth in the company's total sales over the last two years, with international sales rising an impressive 513% per year, from £0.7m in 2010 to £27.2m in 2012. In 2011, Mark Group bought New Zealand-based Right House, an energy saving business previously owned by electricity provider Meridian Energy. This added another market where increasing government subsidies are driving the take-up of insulation services, and the company now has operations in seven locations in New Zealand. Mark Group expects significant growth in the US over the next few years as it expands its coverage of Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey —states where temperatures can reach the high 30s in the summer, yet experience deep snow and freezing temperatures in winter. In addition to its increasing international sales, the company has also seen significant growth in the UK, where revenues were up 50% last year. Demand for energy-efficiency measures has been driven directly by subsidies from energy companies and local governments, as the grants substantially reduce the cost of insulating homes. The company is now an approved provider, assessor and installer for the government's latest environmental initiative the Green Deal. It is looking to create 400 jobs by the end of the year through the expansion of its Home Performance Team, which assesses the energy efficiency of houses nationwide. 2 TBG Advertising agency 443.87% Global brands like Dell and Heineken turn to TBG for social media ad campaigns.

Oil revenues could be better spent,Norway,"Scottish voters have every right to feel confused about Scotland’s oil. Last week, they were told by the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, that oil was running out and revenues will dwindle from 4% of GDP today to 0.03% by 2040. The Scottish Government insists oil production is expanding, that there remains  £1.5 trillion in revenues to be extracted from the North Sea. Who is right? They both are. As explained by Professor Gavin McCrone in today’s Sunday Herald, it is unlikely we will ever again see revenues of £28 billion a year flowing to the UK or Scottish Treasury. But Oil & Gas UK, the industry body, is adamant that production is set to increase from 1.5 million barrels a day to  two million barrels, as a result of new fields. Last year, PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted an investment boom in the North Sea of up to £376bn, and that seems to be true. On Good Morning Scotland in March, Business Secretary Vince Cable said: “I think that in the past there’s been a belief that [the North Sea Oil industry] was declining, and it isn’t declining, it’s got great prospects.” Scotland has a valuable asset in North Sea oil and gas, 98% of which is in Scottish waters. It would irresponsible to base any country’s economic future on a volatile natural resource, but the case for economic independence does not depend on oil alone. Scotland has a financial services industry employing 100,000 people, more world-class universities than France or Germany, a burgeoning renewable energy sector, a healthy tourist industry and useful exports, including whisky. For a country of five million, that is not bad. Scotland is the only country, region, principality or state to have discovered oil and not received any direct benefit from it. Even Shetland, with 22,000 people, secured an oil fund worth £1bn. Norway has one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, worth $700bn. In Alaska, citizens receive an annual dividend as their share of oil revenues. In the 1970s, the UK Government underplayed the value of North Sea Oil in order to discourage nationalism. The unionist Better Together should be careful of playing the same game today. Between £200bn and £300bn in North Sea Oil revenues have gone to the UK Exchequer since oil was discovered nearly 50 years ago. Much of it went to finance tax cuts, the deindustrialisation of Britain and to take on the trades unions. It is not greedy or selfish for Scots to argue this wealth could have been put to better use. Nor is it self-centred to argue that today, with Scotland’s serious social problems, that future revenues could be put to better purpose too."
Water therapy under the midnight sun,Norway,"Travel | NORWAY Norway's fjord-indented coastline delights Gillian Orr during the long daylight hours In the far north of Norway, in the small fishing town of Svolvaer, the smell of the ocean hung in the air. More specifically, it was the smell of the ocean's inhabitants that was really getting up my nose. On this remote Lofoten island, the coastline is dotted with wooden racks, or hjell, on which cod is hung out to dry to make stockfish, one of the world's oldest food preservation methods. The pungent, almost offensive scent lingered in the air. I'd arrived here from Bodo, a rather soulless industrial fishing town on the mainland that's a three-hour boat ride south across the Vestfjord. The Torghatten Nord ferry is primarily used by locals, but such are the incredible scenes of the hundreds of uninhabited islands on offer, the trip is an equally deserving part of the tourist trail. I was just a few hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. The summer days are long around here; in July Svolvaer never really gets dark. It can leave you with a muddled sense of time, the bright blue skies not corresponding with the hands on the clock. And it seemed I wasn't the only one confused. Following a stockfish dinner at Bojer restaurant (don't let that pong put you off; its strange texture and unapologetic saltiness are rather wonderful), my travel companion and I walked across the harbour to Svolvaer's only bar. It was 1am and locals, old and young, were chatting and drinking with no sense that it might be time to think about turning in. Without night's cloak to trick us into retiring to bed, we accepted an invitation from two students to ride out on their boat to chase the midnight sun. As the low-lying sun is often hidden behind mountains, the best way to glimpse it is out at sea. When I finally saw those 2am rays it was a spectacular sight: the powerful glare had me reaching for my sunglasses. However, my marvelling was cut short when I tripped over the boat's railing and fell into the water, becoming quickly acquainted with the North Sea (which is very cold). Perhaps the combination of Aquavit and lack of sleep wasn't such a good one after all. Still, it was a refreshing introduction to the Norwegian landscape, which is defined by land that's fragmented by fjords and vast lakes. The coastline is one of the world's longest and stretches for over 25,000km; some 50,000 islands are scattered off it. Water also plays a big part in the economy: Norway's two biggest industries are fishing and oil. As it's such an important characteristic, I'd come to make the most of it and experience it in its various forms. In the summer, the sea up in the north is often placid and (relatively) temperate enough to enjoy close up. A 20-minute drive south-west from Svolvaer is Henningsvaer, where I embarked on a three-hour kayak trip, travelling between the cluster of nearby islands and fishing villages. Despite blue skies and an agreeable temperature of 16C, the snow-topped mountains on view were a reminder of the long winter months, when lakes will freeze and snow will blanket the landscape. From here, I made my way to Evenes on the mainland; two short plane rides later, I found myself in Alesund, hundreds of kilometres south down the coast. More water. Here, I hopped on board the Hurtigruten cruise ship that wriggles through the fjords to Geiranger. The four-hour trip winds down some magnificent passages including Geirangerfjord, 15km of some of nature's most spectacular riches, with snow-capped mountains, lush greenery, deep blue water and two dramatic waterfalls, the Bridal Veil and Seven Sisters. At the end of all this is Geiranger, a town of only 250 inhabitants. In summer, its population swells. Last year 300,000 people visited during the season. You only need to see the view from Flydalsjuvet lookout point, with the towering cliffs and waterfalls, to understand what makes Geiranger such a popular spot. After a quick bite to eat in the harbour, I made my way up the hill to the Union Hotel and Spa. Sitting in the outdoor infinity pool halfway up the mountains, after a full body massage, looking down at the fjord, I experienced tranquillity that I couldn't quite imagine beating. From Geiranger, it's a five-minute ferry ride along the fjord to Linge, where I found Juvet, a hotel set at the bottom of a mountain range, amid the vast greenery of the valley floor. Each of the eight cabins is designed to make you feel like you are sleeping in the great outdoors, with one huge floor-to-ceiling glass window looking out over woodland, mountains and a stream which you can hear in your room. There's relaxing, and then there's Juvet. If you're brave, you can take a dip in the stream. While I wouldn't exactly describe the experience as pleasant, it did have some sort of restorative effect - and the outdoor hot tub certainly helped. There is also a steam room and sauna. On a walk in the mountains the following day I stumbled across Olav's Spring. There is a sign that tells the story of an old ruler of Norway, King Olav, who came here in 1029 and would wash in the spring. Local folklore claims that the water has healing properties and those who drink from it will go on to lead long and healthy lives. I knelt down and had a go. Although I already felt healthier and more revived than I had in a long time, I figured a little bit of insurance couldn't hurt.

Norway factfile,Norway,"Key facts about the wealthy Scandinavian nation of Norway, which holds parliamentary elections on Monday, September 9: GEOGRAPHY: Mainland Norway runs along the western coast of the Scandinavian peninsula; at 323,802 square kilometres or 125,020 square miles it is a bit larger than Italy or the US state of New Mexico, but smaller than Vietnam. When its island territory of Svalbard is included, Norway covers 385,199 square kilometres or 148,726 square miles. Norway's territory is extremely rugged, and the coastline indented by spectacular fjords, or inlets, which are a major tourist attraction. It has land borders with Sweden, Finland, and Russia, and a large part of its mainland and Svalbard lies above the Arctic Circle. POPULATION: 5.0 million, of whom about 60,000 are Sami, or Laplanders. Norway is the second least densely populated country in Europe, after Iceland. RELIGION: The Norwegian Lutheran Church was the official church until June 2012, when it represented 76 percent of the population. CAPITAL: Oslo: 613,285 inhabitants in 2012. HISTORY: Norway and parts of Sweden were the original homeland of the people known as Vikings, who in the Middle Ages raided and settled in several other parts of Europe, and are also believed to have sailed to North America. In early modern times Norway was ruled first by Denmark and then by Sweden, before it achieved independence in 1905. During World War II the country was occupied by the Germans; since then it has achieved great wealth, mainly owing to oil and gas reserves discovered in the North Sea in the 1960s. Norway was one of the first countries to grant voting rights to women, in 1913. Two referendums, in 1972 and 1994, rejected bids to join the European Union. The country is a member of the Council of Europe. While it is not an EU member it adheres to the EU's Schengen ""open borders"" agreement and to the European Economic Area (EEA). POLITICAL STRUCTURE: Constitutional monarchy under King Harald V, who has mainly ceremonial duties. Members of the 169-seat Storting, or parliament, are elected by proportional representation for four-year terms. At the last elections in September 2009, the Labour-led coalition won a narrow majority of 86 seats. Labour Party leader Jens Stoltenberg has been prime minister since the previous election in 2005. ECONOMY: Thanks to abundant energy resources, Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, with a gross domestic product (GDP) equivalent to $499.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 3.1 percent from the previous year. Per capita GDP amounted to $99,558 according to the World Bank. In addition to oil and gas, of which it ranks among the world's leading exporters, it also has major fishing, forestry, hydro-electric and minerals sectors. The country has the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, worth close to $750 billion and invested in shares -- it owns on average 1.25 percent of any listed company -- as well as bonds and real estate. Norway also has one of the largest merchant marines in the world. The country regularly figures near the top of the UN's worldwide Human Development Index, in 2012 it ranked number one. CURRENCY: Norwegian krone (crown) ARMED FORCES: 24,500 troops (International Institute of Strategic Studies, 2013). Norway is a member of NATO and in July it had 166 soldiers in Afghanistan.

DJ Lebanon Delays First Energy Bidding Round,Norway,"Lebanon has delayed the first oil and natural gas licensing round in its Mediterranean coastal waters as the government failed to vote on decrees needed to start the bidding process, said energy minister Gebran Bassil. The licensing round was deferred to Dec. 10 from Nov. 4 and could face another delay if the cabinet fails to approve the necessary decrees by Oct. 2, Mr. Bassil said, in a statement posted on his official website late Wednesday. ""What happened is neither a disaster nor the end of the road for us, but it is a big loss for us because it affects our credibility...This delay could make some companies hesitate or withdraw from the bid,"" the minister said. Lebanon has already shortlisted 46 international oil firms for the licensing round. U.S. giant ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CVX), France's Total SA (TOT), Norway's Statoil ASA (STO), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) and Italy's Eni SpA (E) are among 12 firms that have been pre-qualified as operators, according to the Petroleum Administration. The administration also shortlisted 34 firms for non-operator status, including Korea National Oil Corp., or KNOC, Russia's OAO Rosneft (ROSN.RS) and Japan's Inpex Corp. (1605.TO). The delay, which comes after a meeting between the energy minister and caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati failed to approve a special government session for the vote, ""gives an advantage to Israel which is looking for market share for its gas exports,"" Mr. Bassil said. However, if the government can vote on the decrees by Oct. 2, Lebanon can sign the energy contracts by March 31, next year, he said. Lebanon, which passed an oil law in 2010 and formed a petroleum board last year, is opening prospects for exploration because it hopes sizeable discoveries could bring in funds to help cut its high level of government debt and meet its domestic power demands. Geophysical data covering the exploration area in the eastern Mediterranean already indicate that the region contains several trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Lebanon, a tiny Mediterranean country, faces economic and fiscal challenges that are contributing to its mounting public debt. Insecurity related to threats from across the borders of its neighbors Syria and Israel, and internal political and security instability that could jeopardize foreign investments and tourism, have all contributed to the country's hardships. By the end of July last year, Lebanon's gross public debt stood at $55.4 billion or 136.4% of the country's gross domestic product, according to the Association of Banks in Lebanon.

You can follow al the latest news at Telegraph Finance[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/?source=refresh] and we will be back on Monday. In the meantime, thank you for following and have a great weekend. 16.48 European markets are now closed, and having swung between losses and gains all day they have finally closed in the black. The FTSE 100 closed up 0.12pc In Germany the Dax was up 0.39pc In France the Cac was up 0.94pc In Spain the Ibex was up 1.03pc In Italy the FTSE Mib was up 1.21pc Torben Kaaber, chief executive at Saxo Capital Markets, said: The driver of both equity and bond markets appears to be mass guesswork on the timing of tapering, so both will experience yo-yo movements until we have clarity. There is a childish quality to equities at the moment whereby, like an infant trying to avoid taking nasty-tasting but effective medicine, indices rejoice when economic problems look like they’ll be put off until another day and have a tantrum when the inevitable Fed reality check appears imminent. 16.28 It has been a ""classic case of déjà vu"" with today's US jobs numbers, according to Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets. July missed expectations, as did August. A significant amount of optimism going into the report with markets factoring in a +190k number and a loud hissing sound as the actual number subsequently punctured it. The disappointing number did prove to be a bit of a boon for stock markets initially though investors started to factor out the odds of a Fed tapering program this month and shifted their expectations slightly further out. European markets did move to their highest levels of the week in the wake of today’s report as investors readjusted their expectations as to the timing of any tapering program, pushing it back from September by a couple of months. While it would seem that there is an expectation that the Fed might keep its current dose of monetary morphine going for some time yet, there remains a concern that we are still merely delaying the inevitable, and this has limited the upside and seen stocks slip back, though a report from Russia that suggested they would aid Syria in the event of an external attack, didn’t help sentiment sending stocks to their lowest levels of the day, before recovering after President Obama stated that it was important not to “jump the gun"" on any Syria vote. 16.06 The US porn industry is latest reason being given for the worse-than-expected non-farm payroll. The Washington Post's Wonkblog reports : The adult film industry appears to have made a disappointing August jobs report look even worse. The report shows carnage in the movie business. It lost 22,000 jobs on the month, or nearly 6 percent of its total jobs. The blog claims that a porn actress, Cameron Bay, tested HIV positive in mid-August. This led studio stopping filming form the 12th to the 24th until all those that had performed with her were tested negative for the virus. However, it was the same week that the government wall gathering figures for the jobs report. Here is the Labour Bureau's graph of recording jobs showing a sharp drop off in August. 15.28 While we've been distracted by the flurry of market activity following the disappointing US jobs figures, George Osborne has made a triumphant announcement from the G20: Twitter: George Osborne - Firm timetable agreed on tax info exchange and tax transparency for 1st time at #G20[http://search.twitter.com/search?q=G20] . Solid British achievement. 15.11 Then again, at least the jobs market is growing, as Justin Wolfers points out. Twitter: Justin Wolfers - See how the bars were getting big for a while? That was the case for tapering.But see how they're smaller now?That. http://t.co/60pzV8ch6w[http://t.co/60pzV8ch6w] 15.00 Many have taken to Twitter to point out that there has been no pick-up in the rate of jobs growth in the US: Twitter: Michael Hewson - In the 12 mths to date, total US jobs added 2m, In the previous 12 mth period from Sep 2011 to Aug 2012 total jobs added 2m. Jobs growth? 14.34 Or for a ""symbolic"" taper, maybe? Twitter: Nouriel Roubini - Employment report weak; it implies no taper in Sept or a symbolic taper with a dovish FOMC statement to prevent further rise in long rates 14.32 Just enough jobs growth to taper? That's what Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics thinks: In one line: Should be enough, just, to trigger tapering this month. 14.11 Economist Justin Wolfers is already looking ahead to the next set of job's figures and is more upbeat than today's: Twitter: Justin Wolfers - My guess is that next month we'll be looking at consensus forecasts of +140-150k, with unemployment at 7.4%. 13.56 While the jobs report does little good to Washington and Main Street, Wall Street is enjoying the prospect of more time with full-blown stimulus from the Fed. 13.54 The Wall Street Journal's market reporter Steven Russolillo has expressed his dismay at today's disappointing US jobs figure: We can't stress enough the mediocrity surrounding this jobs report and the previous monthly revisions. The labor market is stagnant and just isn't growing at a pace that suggests a strong and sustainable economic recovery. The lowest workforce-participation rate in 35 years reflects how soft the situation truly is. More than four years into this recovery, the labor market should be better. It's not. 13.51 The worse-than-expected jobs figures for August and the huge downward revision in July is good news for the equity markets. With the labour market not as strong as many had expected, those September-tapering expectations are looking a couple of months early. The FTSE 100 has swung into the black, up 0.4pc European have followed - the Dax is up 0.3pc, the Cac is up 0.5pc, the Ibex is up 1pc and the FTSE Mib is up 0.9pc. Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Rockwell Securities said: The revision is a little shocking. This is telling the same story that we've seen for a while: employers are not firing people, but at the same time there's not a lot of hiring going on. But since the report and the revision are disappointing, that increases the odds of the Fed holding steady. That's why we're seeing a plunge in Treasury yields, which is positive for stock prices. 13.45 Taper expectations up in the air So, the million dollar question (or 85 billion dollar question) - will the Fed start paring back its massive stimulus programme this month? Mohamed El-Erain, boss of bond traders Pimco, thinks that today's figure will do little to sway the Fed from starting its taper in September: The market is taking this morning’s somewhat disappointing data as suggesting that the Fed will not taper in September. I am not so sure that is the case. BNP Paribas has been shooting for a December start date, and thinks these figures are consistent with that prediction: Although the unemployment rate was lower, there were negative revisions of 74,000 and that has pushed both U.S. yields and the dollar lower. But those downward revisions come after many months of upward revisions. So overall, I think the trend still shows an improving labor market. We at BNP Paribas believe that the Federal Reserve will taper in December anyway so this report is still consistent with that view. 13.39 In another blow to the US economy, July's numbers were revised down dramatically. At the time, it was reported that the economy added 162,000 new jobs in July - but latest figures say the figure was more like 104,000. 13.36 Dollar takes a tumble The US dollar took a dive after the US jobs numbers disappointed. It was trading at a seven week high against the euro, until sliding 0.3pc to $1.3155 per euro. Here's HSBC's Robert Lynch explaining of the reaction: Assuming tapering is factored into the market already, the worse-than-expected jobs data would result into considerable scaling back in expectation. Dollar will respond negatively to that. 13.33 The unemployment rate has dropped, to 7.3pc...but participation rate is lower, too. Twitter: Nouriel Roubini - Fall in unemployment rate is driven by fall in labor force participation rate, sign of labor market weakness with more discouraged workers 13.30 Major US jobs disappointment The figures are in and they fall well short of the market's expectations. Just 169,000 new jobs were created in August. Consensus was for 180,000 and a number of economists thought the figure could rise as high as 200,000. 13.26 We're getting some comments from the governor of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans. He says he does not see the current asset purchase programme ending until 2014, but has not given an indicator of when it might start being wound down. But econonomist Justin Wolfers has taken a look at his maths and concludes the taper will begin in October, not September: Twitter: Justin Wolfers - Evans' math suggests an October taper: 2 more months at $85b, then 8 months tapering to zero by mid-2014. Gets to his $1.25T for QE3. 13.02 The FTSE Small Cap and Aim shares are flat and 0.1pc higher respectively, outperforming their larger counterparts, the FTSE100 and FTSE250 which are both down 0.1pc. But, it is worth noting (courtesy of Reuters) that volumes are well below average, with many traders trimming positions ahead of the publication of U.S non-farm payroll numbers. Volumes on the FTSE 100 stood at just 20pc of their usual 90-day average amount. The Fed is expected to start scaling back its $85 billion a month bond-buying program as the US economic recovery gathers pace, and the jobs data may give fresh clues on timing. Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC Securities, told Reuters: It's going to be an important data release as the Fed has identified the level of employment as a key indicator for its monetary policy decisions and when to start tapering. A much stronger than expected number might not be taken very well by the market. 13.00 Half an hour 'til non-farm payrolls time. As Eimear Daly head of market analysis at Monex Europe points out, this piece of data is the final word before the Fed meets later this month and decides whether or not to push the red button on tapering its $85bn per month stimulus programme (or QE3 to its friends). But she is unconvinced the figure will be a sizzler, and asks whether it could even reveal another crack in the US recovery. Economic data is beginning to reveal holes in the US recovery. Higher US mortgage rates have begun to wear on homebuyers with drops in new home sales, pending sales and a fall in new building work. Sharp declines in stock prices have unnerved US businesses resulting in a string of negative business confidence surveys. With geopolitical uncertainty now in the mix, the US business owner on Main Street will be wary to take on new staff. August is likely to see some rebound in jobs growth from July’s lows but strong gains seem unlikely, casting further doubt on whether we will see a decision to begin tapering in September. 12.38 It's been almost exactly five years since the global financial crisis kicked off with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. But how much do you remember about it? Try the Wall Street Journal'squiz[http://projects.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/quiz/?uid=crisisquiz0829&type;=flat] to find out. 12.20 Is Greece's economic slowdown bottoming out? The Greek economy has been in an austerity-fuelled recession for nearly six years- but the latest GDP reading shows the pace of economic shrinkage has slowed right down - to 3.8pc. The GDP reading relates to the April to June quarter and may have been helped by a rebound in tourism in the debt-laden country. 12.00 Some of the biggest names in business and economics are at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy this weekend. Nouriel Roubini, aka Dr Doom, is among the speakers- he'll be talking about Autumn's ""known unknowns"" [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-main-risks-to-the-global-economy-in-the-coming-months-by-nouriel-roubini] - the forseeable events whose impact is uncertain. And there are rather a lot of them... • The dreaded 'taper' - the question of when the US Federal Reserve will begin paring back on its massive $85bn per month stimulus, which of course has already started impacting markets. Ben Bernanke's successor as chairman will also be a key decision. • Debt ceiling in the US - in all likelihood a partisan stand-off will see the US raise its debt ceiling yet again as Democrats and Republicans clash over the budget. But, Roubini notes, with a marjority of the Republican Party on a ""jihad against government spending"", markets should not rule out the possibility of a fiscal shock. • The German general election - a surprise outcome which does not see Angela Merkel return to the head of government will create huge uncertainty in the eurozone. • Fragile governments in eurozone periphery - Silvio Berlusconi's criminal conviction puts the Italian government at risk of collapse while in Greece, the ruling coalition came close to losing its mandate in June after one minority partner quit the government and the other came close. • Unpredictable reactions to central bank pledges to keep interest rates low - Roubini notes that neither the European Central Bank nor the Bank of England's ""forward guidance"" have managed to prevent a rise in long and short term borrowing costs, which could stifle economic recovery. • Shinzo Abe's 'third arrow' of reform - Japan's new premier has already introduced a spending boost and monetary stimulus to help the world's third largest economy climb out of its decades long funk. But he has yet to implement much-needed structural reforms, and there are doubts about the effectiveness of a planned sales tax hike due in 2014. • Hangover time for emerging markets - the macroeconomic weakness of many emerging markets has been exposed by the withdrawal of external supports such as China's growth and easy money from the US Federal Reserve's successive quantitative easing programmes. How they will react to this is largely unknown but will impact on the global economy. • Syria intervention - We don't yet know whether Western militaries will stage an intervention in Syria nor how long they could stay in the country. A prolonged strike will push oil prices up, a move which could tip the balance for many economies into full-blown crisis. • Iranian-Israeli tensions - another geopolitical event that has the potential to wreak havoc with the oil price. Israeli patience is wearing thin as it seeks unmet reassurances that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons. 11.46 The FTSE 100 has slipped in to the red, as three stocks dropped for every two that climbed, after that those figures out this morning that took some of the shine off recent strong economic data (see 09.36). It has dropped 8.77, or 0.14pc, to 5,523.50. The blue-chip index had advanced 1.7pc so far this week after the European Central Bank said monetary policy will remain accommodative and reports showed manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in Britain and China. Mining stocks are dragging the main board lower. Fresnillo, Randgold Resources and Anglo American Plc are all down more than 1pc. 11.09 German industrial output misses Output from manufacturers, utilities and miners in Germany dropped 1.7pc in July, more even than the most pessimistic forecasts of a 1.3pc slide. But the figure is influenced by particularly strong comparators in earlier months - and industrial ouput has actually risen 0.5pc over the last two months. 11.00 Anxiety ahead of today's US jobs data has seen the flow of money in and out of stocks and bonds stutter this week, says Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's Barnaby Martin in a note to clients. He noted that while money continued to pour into European equities, that the rate nearly halved from the previous week. Still, emerging market funds contined to shed money for the 15th week in a row. 10.40 Inflation expectations have also eased - asked about how much prices were likely to rise over the next year, respondents gave a median anser of 3pc, compared with 3.3pc in May. As economist Howard Archer points out, this is especially good news for Mr Carney as public fear of high inflation is one of the elements that could derail his forward guidance plan: The appreciable reduction in inflation expectations is important as under the forward guidance scheme that the Bank of England has adopted, a de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations is one of the three “knockout"" criteria that the bank has set out that could potentially cause it to raise interest rates before the unemployment rate gets down to 7.0pc. 10.23 Is Mark Carney's forward guidance working its magic on the British public? The Bank of England's new governor seems to have convinced the British public that interests rates will stay low. Under a third of respondents to the Bank's inflation expectations survey expect interest rates to rise over the next 12 months, the lowest since November 2008 and near an all-time low. Back in August, Mr Carney vowed to keep interest rates at their record low at least as long as unemployment remains above 7pc. The Bank forecasts this to happen in mid-2016, but a number of analysts have pencilled in a 2015 date. 10.00 The pound is dropping on those disappointing figures, it is now down to $1.557. 09.46 Separate figures showed Britain's goods trade deficit widened to £9.85bn in July after narrowing sharply in June. Economists had forecast a gap of £8.153bn Including services, in which Britain traditionally runs a surplus, the trade deficit widened to £3.085. That was more than double its level in June and the worst reading since October 2012. Exports to non-European Union countries plunged by nearly 16pc, the biggest monthly fall since January 2009. Monthly trade figures are volatile but July's figures may dampen hopes that Britain's economic recovery is broadening and moving onto a more sustainable footing. 09.36 Some figures out this morning taking some of the shine off recent strong economic data. British industrial output - which makes up about one sixth of Britain's economy - was flat in July, below expectations of a 0.2pc gain, and there was a marked deterioration in the trade balance, according to data from the Office for National Statistics said. That is markedly lower than the upwardly revised figure of 1.3pc in June. The narrower category of manufacturing rose by 0.2pc, in line with forecasts, from an upwardly revised 2pc in June. 09.13 The latest housing market data from Halifax shows that prices have risen at the fastest level since June 2010. Here's our full story from James Titcomb.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/houseprices/10290604/House-prices-rise-at-fastest-rate-for-three-years.html] Halifax's house price index for August revealed that house prices increased for the seventh straight consecutive month, and the annual rate of growth was faster than in July, when prices rose 4.6pc year-on-year. The average price of a house in the UK was £170,231 - the highest level since September 2008. However, there were signs that growth is slowing down - on a month-by-month basis, prices grew 0.4pc in August, against 0.9pc in July. This was less than the 0.7pc growth economists had predicted. 09.08 Back in markets, Tullow Oil is making gains, topping the FTSE 100 this morning, after it had a breakthrough in Norway - its first oil discovery at its site in the Barents Sea, off the north coast. ""This is a major frontier light oil discovery for Norway, Tullow Oil and our co-venturers,"" says exploration director Angus McCoss. Shares are up 19, or 1.84pc, to £10.52. 08.40 And the forecasts have started rolling in for the all-important non-farm payrolls figure. The consensus among economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for a rise of 180,000. Goldman Sachs has published a more bullish prediction, expecting a 200,000 gain - citing the employment components of various other economic surveys in recent weeks, a rise in job advertisements and an uptick in the job availability measure of the latest US consumer confidence report. Saxo Capital Markets are also shooting for an above-consensus figure of a 190-200k jump. Here's Nick Beecroft's take: The unemployment rate, with any luck, will tick down 0.1 percent. If it hasn’t, it’s probably because the participation rate has increased – and more people looking for work is in itself good news. I would say there’s around a 70 percent chance we will see the Fed start tapering QE in September. The Fed is going to have trouble keeping market expectations for rate rises in control. It’s going to be very interesting to see how they manage the damage limitation that they’re facing right now. 08.35 A muted start to markets as all eyes turn to the US and the non-farm payroll numbers, while the G20 meeting carries on into its second day as leaders continue to wrangle about a co-ordinated response to events in Syria. The FTSE 100 is up 0.09pc In Germany the Dax is up 0.16pc In France the Cac is up 0.23pc In Spain the Ibex is up 0.3pc In Italy the FTSE Mib is up 0.18pc However, Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, warns markets not to get too ahead of themselves after the disappointment of last month, when a number of 225,000 had been expected but it came in drastically lower at 162,000. Expectations for a good number have been building throughout the week as US investors chose to focus on the positive data this week, like the ISM manufacturing and services data, the Beige Book, auto sales and the encouraging jobless claims. Apart from Syria, it is the employment data more than anything that has focussed minds this week with yesterday’s services ISM employment component coming in at its best level since February being taken as a sign that we could get a good jobs report today. While not wishing to rain on anyone’s parade I think we’ve been here before, when last month there was a lot of exuberance about the number we would get with numbers of 225k being touted about, and we consequently got 162k, with a number of downward revisions on previous months as well. 08.30 It's that time of the month again- non-farm payrolls day in the US. America's monthly update on the number of people in employment has become an economic totem ever since US Fed chair Ben Bernanke said the central bank would raise interest rates when unemployment fell below 6.5pc. As we noted last time round, the figure usually sparks a flurry in the markets, even, apparently, helping traders burn more calories. 08.15 House prices are rising at their fastest clip since 2010, according to Halifax's latest survey. Buying a home this summer would have cost, on average, 5.4pc more than the same time last year. But Martin Ellis, the building society's housing economist, thinks that the pace is likely to ease later in the year, constrained by stubbornly flat or falling incomes: Relatively modest economic growth and below inflation rises in earnings are likely to act as a brake on the market. Overall, house prices are expected to rise gradually over the remainder of the year. 08.12 As James Titcomb notes in the City Briefing email[http://pages.email.telegraph.co.uk/CityDeskSignuppage/?utm_source=tmg&utm;_medium=Puff_city&utm;_campaign=email], Tullow Oil has made a breakthrough in Norway - its first oil discovery at its site in the Barents Sea, off the north coast. ""This is a major frontier light oil discovery for Norway, Tullow Oil and our co-venturers,"" says exploration director Angus McCoss. 08.11 Markets in Asia were mixed overnight, ahead of big jobs data out of the US today - the outcome of which could signal the likelihood of the US Federal Reserve kicking off its taper later this month. The Nikkei closed down 1.45pc, largely driven by profit-taking from a recent rally on construction and real estate shares as doubts were cast over Japan's chances of winning its bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 0.29pc and the Shanghai Composite climbed 0.8pc. 07.46 Germany, historically an export-driven economy, looks to be adjusting to a new normal after July data showed that imports rose while exports dropped in the month. The EU powerhouse economy's exports have ben hit in recent months due to continued weakness in its trading partners in the rest of the continent and China. But domestic demand is picking up. 07.15 The G20 is underway at St Petersburg, and while leaders have put on a show of economic unity by signing agreements on jobs and growth, tackling international tax evasion and tighter financial regulation, the emerging market struggle at the behest of the US Federal Reserve's imminent ""tapering"" of stimulus has not gone unmentioned. While they refrained from pointing the finger at the Fed, the emerging market members of the G20 last night did fire a warning shot at their developed counterparts. Here's a line from the statement by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa: The eventual normalisation of monetary policies needs to be effectively and carefully calibrated and clearly communicated. G20 host Vladimir Putin also weighed in with pointed comments on the uneven pattern of global recovery - while the US has pulled ahead, European countries are lagging behind and the emerging markets appear to be stalling: Our main task is returning the global economy towards steady and balanced growth. This task has unfortunately not been resolved. Systemic risks, the conditions for an acute crisis relapse, persist. 07.10 The Financial Times reports that EU business leaders operating in China have hit out at the ""unfair"" targeting of foreign groups in the country[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/07a234be-160e-11e3-a57d-00144feabdc0.html] .

Fjord focus; INES WATSON takes a cruise around Norway and discovers an enchanting country with some of the most stunning scenery on Earth The lighter side to dark neighbour,Norway,"WHY are the Scandinavians reputed to be so miserable? I find myself wondering this as I sit on the cocktail deck of an elegant cruise liner, sipping a Cosmopolitan and watching some of the most stunning scenery I've ever seen in my life slide past. With all these mountains, waterfalls and fjords, you'd think they'd be skipping around like Julie Andrews. But no, it's all screaming Munch paintings, doleful Ibsen plays and dark Jo Nesbo novels about neo-Nazis and serial killers. And that's just the Norwegians. Who's to blame? Well, perhaps it's the trolls. Those strangely shy creatures who lurk in the woods and tempt innocents to terrible fates. Yes, those dark and forested mountains over there could certainly make you wonder what lives within them - especially when the long winter nights come and you can only look forward to some light in two months' time. Or when you're trying to eke out a living in a freezing dark wooden hut, living on salted fish and not much else. ""We were so poor we were like the Irish - without the potatoes,"" one extremely friendly Norwegian explains. Yes, but all that has changed, and changed rapidly with the explosion of the oil industry. Black gold has shaken the black dog from Norway's back and this beautiful, sparsely populated country has transformed itself in a few decades into a liberal, prosperous society which is admired all around the world. Taking a cruise around the Norwegian fjords has always been a firm tourism favourite, and apart from the joy of being transported around in comfort, it is really the ideal way to capture the mystery and beauty of this country's breathtaking west coast. Our ship, the Balmoral, is one of Norway's own Fred Olsen fleet, and with seven ports to visit, we can look forward to capturing the essence of Scotland's North Sea neighbour - from the petrol-rich Stavanger in the south to the eerie, misty solitudes of the far North Cape. You want sophistication? Then try Bergen. So beautiful, its medieval Bryggen quarter is now a Unesco World Heritage Site, and you can spend hours there exploring this amazing warren of wooden streets, full of tempting restaurants and stylish upmarket shops. The TURN TO NEXT PAGE FROM PREVIOUS PAGE Hanseatic Museum gives a taste of the old days when dried cod ruled the world. One American visitor, eying an unpleasantly desiccated fishy example, asks hopefully: ""Did they serve it with dips?"" No, there are no dips - not for the next 300 years or so - but there is scenery. Lots and lots of it. For many people on board the Balmoral, the undoubted highlight of the trip is seeing the Midnight Sun at the North Cape, arguably the most northernmost part of continental Europe. A bus ride from the port of Honningsvag takes us to this mystical and amazing place. OK, when we arrive it is more misty than mystical, but the word atmospheric can't really do it justice. How can a bleak headland (but with a very interesting and entertaining visitors' centre) be so fascinating? And yet it is - and globes and cairns and statues tastefully marking various VIP visits don't detract from that feeling of being at the end of the world. Passing reindeer and friendly indigenous Sami camps also add to the richness of the journey, and as we sail away past the headland that night, the clouds clear, the Midnight Sun shines bright and Balmoral's decks are full of happy travellers. Stunning it all may be, but living in the far north is not for sissies. Honningsvag is a rugged little town of wooden houses which refused to die after the Nazis razed the whole place, excluding the church. The bravery and resilience of the townsfolk is commemorated in photographs in the church and the town and - one of the many links that Norway has with Scotland - in the quayside statue of the famous St Bernard dog Bamse, who looks across the sea to his twin in Montrose. After the North Cape, visiting the biggest city in the north, Tromso, feels like a bustling metropolis. Especially when you visit the beautiful Arctic Cathedral. To cope with two months of complete darkness every year, there are two things you have to do: watch the spectacular Northern Lights, and ski using headlamps in the runs surrounding the town. This is the place where the Arctic explorers based themselves before their epic ventures, and tributes to Amundsen and his ilk are all around. There is also a bylaw against walking your polar bear in the streets - a sensible precaution when intrepid explorers used to bring back cute little cubs, only for them to grow big enough to frighten the horses. AFTER our venture to the north, the Lofoten Islands are a lush delight. Pretty beaches, waterfalls and meadows full of scented wildflowers are a welcome surprise. You could spend weeks just exploring these islands alone - and swimming in the surprisingly warm crystal clear waters. But it is time to sail on. The beautiful art nouveau town of Alesund awaits us - with the tiny 'Shetland bus' boats, again showing links to wartime Scotland - as does the prosperous oil town of Stavanger. After two weeks exploring this stunning, fascinating country I can't wait to go back and see some more. And have the Norwegians cheered up since those grim days of toil in the past? Yes - I think even those trolls might have lightened up a bit. . GETTING THERE: A similar Fred Olsen cruise itinerary aboard Balmoral in 2014 is Journey to the North Cape, a cruise of 14 nights, which departs from Southampton on July 27. Prices - with limited availability - start from £1,299 per person, based on two adults sharing an inside cabin and include all food and entertainment on board, and port taxes.

Norwegian fund buys into NY skyscraper,Norway,"Norway's sovereign wealth fund will buy a 45 per cent stake in a midtown Manhattan skyscraper from Boston Properties for $684m in cash as it expands its property holdings in the world's largest economy. The deal with Norway's $750bn oil fund, the world's largest, will value the building named Times Square Tower at $1.52bn. The interest from the fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management, comes at a time when sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors are showing increasing appetite for high-value US property assets. Premier office towers with long-term tenants and retail properties, particularly along shopping routes popular with tourists, have seen rising occupancy and rents. Investors have sought these trophy assets as haven investments, banking on predictable income streams, and driving up property values. In June, the families of Chinese property developer Zhang Xin and Brazil's banking empire Safra bought a 40 per cent stake in the General Motors Building for about $1.4bn. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is seeking to raise the proportion of its holdings in real estate to 5 per cent. It made its first US investment this year and has commercial property holdings in London, Paris, Frankfurt and other European cities. As of the end of the second quarter it had property assets equivalent to 0.9 per cent of its holdings. ""The property is unencumbered by debt, and no financing will be involved in the closing,"" the fund said in a statement. The 47-level Times Square Tower was developed by Boston Properties and completed in 2004 and is 99 per cent leased. The property group, which develops and operates office, residential and retail buildings, will retain a 55 per cent interest in the property and will manage the tower. Boston Properties said it expected to distribute at least the amount of proceeds needed to avoid paying a corporate level tax on any gain realised from the planned sale. The agreement to purchase the stake was signed on September 6 and the transaction is expected to close within 90 days. Shares in Boston Properties edged 0.6 per cent higher to $105.43."
Electorate needs hard facts on the impact of independence,Norway,"With one year to go we are no further forward in getting precise information which will allow a decision on which way to vote which should be made with the head and not the heart. The respective Yes and No campaigns merely engage in claim and counterclaim which the media probably find enticing but which the average person is totally bored with . Perhaps all will be revealed in the SNP Government fabled White Paper due for release in November, although my gut feeling tells me this again will be generic information rather than real facts. The public need to know what they are voting for and it would be good to see spreadsheets showing how we are being governed right now from Holyrood and Westminster compared to how it would look after independence. This should be in clearly understood text for the public to understand and should include before and after data such as organisation structures, economy charts, distribution of pensions and welfare , immigration policy, currency and Euro membership etc. Only then can we make an informed judgment. The Yes campaign is promoting utopia whilst the No campaign is preaching fear, uncertainty and doubt, although I agree with the questions they are asking. I am always an advocate of “if it ain’t broke, don’t try to fix it”, which is how I regard the current situation. Alex Salmond following his Ireland and Iceland economies comparisons to Scotland, these countries are now on the back burner due to their failures and he has switched his attention to Norway and Denmark as benchmarks for independence. I have travelled to both these countries on business and as a tourist and they are horrendously expensive. It is claimed that they have excellent healthcare (which is disputed) and welfare systems but this has to be paid for. In Norway, standard income tax is higher than in the UK and VAT is 25 %, with 14 % VAT on food. In short, everything is possible but it takes time and costs money. I am sure if the Scottish public were made aware of the differences – which they can access on the internet – they would give this idealism a wide berth. Andrew Kerr, 28 Benview Terrace, Alloa. Am I the only citizen in Scotland to be suffering from a major depression called September 18th 2014. While I will certainly play my small voting part in ensuring that our great country remains part of the United Kingdom, it must be time now for the UK media to give viewers, readers and listeners a rest from the incessant coverage of the Scottish referendum which is still a year away. Voters, who have yet to make up their minds, have many months ahead to make up their views, and even they will appreciate a major cooling of referendum coverage from the UK media and politicians of both sides for a few months. The world is moving on and there are many important issues that we would like to hear about. The Scottish referendum has now passed the boring and snoring level. Give us all peace. Iain J McConnell, Speedybank, Station Road, Gifford, East Lothian. It seems that Johan Lamont is opposed to Scotland’s independence on the grounds of her being a socialist and wishing to demonstrate solidarity with the people of England. As someone who was a child of the 1950s in Scotland, I wonder if I am alone in thinking that it is a strange kind of socialist who: a) Wants to abolish free prescriptions in Scotland; b) Remove bus passes from the over 60s in Scotland; c) Re-introduce university tuition fees for young people in Scotland. If this is Ms Lamont’s idea of socialism, or what passes for socialism within the Scottish Labour Party these days, then it almost makes the late Prime Minister Edward Heath seem like Arthur Scargill by comparison. Turning to the desire to demonstrate solidarity with the people of England, I well recall that argument being used at the height of the Thatcher era when much of Scotland’s industry was being put to the sword and economic misery heaped upon many of our working class communities. No doubt Ms Lamont would claim that communities in England suffered from Thatcher’s excesses as well. The difference, however, is that the people of Scotland never voted for Thatcherism but we still got it, regardless. The collective amnesia of the Labour Party in Scotland or the absolute denial of what happened to our country in the 18 years between 1979 and 1997 is a major cause for concern among those of us who will never forget it. Next September gives Scotland the chance to say never again will we have a government that we did not vote for. Sadly, that point does not seem to matter to Johan Lamont and Scottish Labour. Gail Finlayson, 6 Larch Tree Way, Banchory. I REFER to the front-page headline (“Economy emerges as key independence battleground”, The Herald, September 18). While undoubtedly a healthy economy is a good thing, I wonder if what the result of the poll is really saying is that we, the voters, regard improvement in our own personal financial circumstances as more important than anything else. If so, this may be partly because we have been brainwashed into such a way of thinking not only by Conservative governments at Westminster, but also by a Labour Party which seems to have abandoned any pretence at socialism. It would be a pity if canvassing now simply means offering “cash for votes”. Even when Alex Salmond claims that an independent Scotland would offer a “fairer society”, he seems to do so under his breath, as if he doesn’t think this is really a vote-winner. But there is a large body of research (eg Professor Richard Wilkinson, “The Spirit Level”, 2009) which shows that countries where there is a smaller gap between rich and poor are countries which enjoy better health, reduced crime rates and a better quality of life, almost regardless of the absolute wealth of the country as a whole. Maybe we really could be happier with a bit less cash in our pockets if we lived in a more equal society. Could independence give us this? Sandy Small, 245 Wilton Street, Glasgow. The UK national debt is presently one trillion pounds, and Scotland’s share of that will be about one hundred thousand million pounds, or £20,000 for every man woman and child. After independence, that debt would become real. Simply walking away from it would not be an option. How would an independent Scotland even service such a debt, let alone repay it. Before we vote in the referendum, Scotland’s First Minister – who has never provided hard facts about the financial implications of independence – should explain how he proposes to deal with this situation. Malcolm Parkin, 15 Gamekeepers Road, Kinnesswood, Kinross. Over the past couple of days we have all been well informed by the media that it is only a year until Scotland decides her future. The economy seems to be the dominant factor and the question often arises over whether Scotland can survive alone or needs handouts from the Westminster Government, and what happens when the oil dries up. But how about turning those questions around? With regard to handouts, Scotland currently contributes 9.9% to the UK economy and gets 9.3% in return. As for oil revenues, what is the UK exchequer going to do when revenue from Scotland’s oil dries up, or Scotland becomes independent and takes control of her oil revenues? A day is a long time in politics, so a year could seem like a lifetime, and 2014 will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for the people of Scotland to decide for themselves, something many nations crave for. Let us grasp the opportunity. Catriona C Clark, 52 Hawthorn Drive, Banknock, Falkirk. As reported (“A year to go and still no clarity”, The Herald, September 19) Nick Clegg, has announced that a No vote will still mean that the Scottish Parliament will receive enhanced powers. Alistair Darling has alluded to this, too, though he has yet to elaborate even as far as Nick Clegg’s roughly sketched offer. David Cameron, the UK’s political leader, doesn’t want to commit to anything yet, an interesting position for a leader to take when faced with the prospect of losing a third of his constituency’s land mass and 90% of its oil. Presumably such enhanced powers will be designed with a view to making Scots more rather than less satisfied with the political settlement than they are now. This is an interesting idea. As the debate to date has hinged very largely on economics, one would assume that a settlement which left nobody any better off wouldn’t attract a great deal of enthusiasm and that there would be at least a possibility of Scots being better off. I am interested to know how the people of the other nation, the principality and the province will react on hearing that Scots are to be given preferential treatment within the UK. I look forward to the Westminster parties presenting this to the electorate in 2015, while at the same time instructing the English, Welsh and Northern Irish to hold on tight for another five years of austerity. However, as this would only come about if we vote No next year, I see no reason why they should, no good reason to expect them to and no good argument as to why our neighbours shouldn’t be out on the streets protesting at a glaring democratic iniquity of the type we in Scotland wouldn’t accept. Since May 2011, an unceasing racket of unionist chanting has demanded “clarity” on Nationalist plans in the event of a Yes vote we are assured won’t happen. As a No vote is a racing certainty, apparently, I’d like some clarity from the unionist parties about what we might expect from them. After all, they have the benefit of their own certitude on which to construct their plans. Martin Morrison, 5 Inverpark, Lochinver, Sutherland."
CTK's Business News in Brief,Norway,"Northeast to make invitations for subsidies worth Kc445m Hradec Kralove - The regional council of the Northeast cohesion region will make three invitations to requests for subsidies from the Regional Operating Programme (ROP) for educational and road projects and marketing activities in tourism, regional council spokeswoman Eva Jouklova told CTK. A total of Kc445m have been earmarked for these projects. Educational and road projects can be submitted from Sept 30 to Oct 31, tourism marketing projects from Nov 1 to Jan 3. Farmers can apply for flood damage compensation as of Oct 7 Prague - Czech farmers whose property was damaged by floods in June this year can start to apply for financial aid to the Agriculture Ministry as of October 7, the ministry said on Friday. The Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday that the European Commission had permitted the Czech Republic to provide an extraordinary subsidy of Kc685m to farmers hit by floods. The EC is yet to assess further aid of about Kc80m for flood-hit fisheries and forests. Share of smartphones to exceed 60 pct in CR this year - GfK Prague - The share of smartphones on total mobile phone sales in the Czech Republic will exceed 60 percent this year, while still in 2012 their share was smaller than 50 percent, according to estimates of analytical company GfK Czech. First smartphones appeared on the market in 2005. Marek Bulir of GfK Czech said the Czech market for mobile phones remains more or less stable in the long run, hovering between 2.7 million and 2.8 million sold units a year. The market recorded a swing in 2009 when sales dipped to slightly over 2.6 million phones. Wikov expects record sales of up to Kc2.3bn in 2014 Prague - Czech company Wikov, a producer of industrial gearboxes, expects record sales of up to Kc2.3bn next year, up by about 40 percent year-on-year, Wikov Industry group owner Martin Wichterle has told CTK. The growth of sales is boosted by the boom of shale gas extraction in the USA and the development of offshore oil extraction, which leads to increased construction of oil rigs and supply ships, Wichterle said. ""These two sectors have provided us with a lot of work, mainly for the year 2014 when we expect to generate record-high sales,"" he added. Wikov's chief customers are EU countries, Norway, China, Korea, India and the USA. ""We are currently achieving the biggest growth on the Russian market,"" Witchterle said. Skoda Electric to raise production, workforce thanks to orders Plzen - Skoda Electric, the largest European trolleybus producer, has trebled production thanks to large export contracts for almost Kc6bn and thanks to the record output, it is enlarging its production plant of Plzen, CEO Jaromir Silhanek told CTK. The company with 760 employees will hire dozens of new workers and technicians. ""We will be producing around 30 trolleybuses a month next year,"" he said. Skoda Electric signed four large export contracts for trolleybuses for almost Kc5.6bn this summer, for 50 new trolleybuses for Sofia and 80 for Bratislava. In July is gained an order for 125 trolleybuses for Riga and this month a contract for 100 trolleybuses for Burgas and other Bulgarian big towns.

""This is the fourth tank with a one million litres storing capacity that our company has made,"" Votapkova said. DHL Express to raise prices in CR by up to 3.9 pct in 2014 Prague - Postal and logistic services operator DHL Express will raise the prices of shipping in the Czech Republic by up to 3.9 percent on average as of January 2014 owing to inflation and a growth of costs, DHL said in a press release on Friday. ""The exact percentage increase will depend on the type of products used by a client and on a client's delivery portfolio,"" Ludek Drnec of DHL Express CZ said. DHL adjusts its prices every year as of January 1. Slovakia to extend network of roads subject to toll Bratislava - Slovakia will extend the duty to pay electronic motorway toll to further road sections and will lso introduce advantages for eco-friendly vehicles and quantity discounts as of next year, the Slovak Transport Ministry said on Friday. The country plans to include another 225 kilometers of first-class roads, mainly in southern and eastern Slovakia, to the toll system. The entire network subject to toll will thus increase by about one tenth. Rates for eco-friendly lorries are to be 2 to 4 percent lower. tam,fs,kou/er "
"The last of the Viking whalers; The tide has turned for the whaling communities of northern Norway, and it is they, rather than their quarry, now facing extinction.",Norway,"The Lofoten Islands[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/9483061/Lofoten-Norway-from-sea-safaris-to-the-Northern-Lights.html] in the far north of Norway have always been a world apart, a peninsula-like chain of wild, craggy shards jutting into the Norwegian Sea inside the Arctic Circle. In Norse folklore Lofoten’s long spine of mountains was said to be the haunt of trolls and valkyries (maidens who conducted slain warriors to Valhalla), and its fjords provided dramatic backdrops to some of the grandest of the Viking sagas. A small wooden boat putters across the glassy expanse of the Vestfjorden, its wake rippling the mirror-perfect reflections of the surrounding mountains. The boat’s skipper, 69-year-old Jan Bjørn Kristiansen, has been sailing these waters for more than 50 years, the past 40 of them in the same weather-beaten vessel, also called Jan Bjørn. The name is fitting, for man and boat have much in common: both are tough, seasoned whalers, quintessentially Norwegian – stubborn, practical, strongly built – and both bear the scars of much hard work at sea. Over the course of the summer whaling season, Kristiansen will harpoon perhaps 30 or 40 minke whales, butcher their carcasses on deck, and sell the meat dockside to seafood merchants along the coast. Despite there being an international moratorium on commercial whaling, Norwegians such as Kristiansen persist in hunting minke whales – for practical reasons they do so only in Norway’s domestic waters. In his five decades as a whaler, Kristiansen has weathered many a storm, both at sea and on land. He lived through the dangerous years of the eco-wars, when activists sabotaged and sank a number of Lofoten whaling boats. And he survived a horrific shipboard accident a few years ago when his harpoon cannon backfired, nearly killing him and leaving him with a mangled left hand. He was back hunting whales the following season. But as he steers towards an old whaling station on this calm midsummer morning, Kristiansen sees not only his own long career drawing to a close, but also an entire way of life. His eponymous boat is one of only 20 that came out to hunt this season – a far cry from the nearly 200 whalers that worked northern Norway’s coastal waters in the late 1950s, when Kristiansen was getting his first taste of whaling as a deckhand. It isn’t a scarcity of whales that is bringing down the curtain, or even the complicated politics of whaling. It is something far more prosaic and inexorable: Norwegian children, even those who grow up in the seafaring stronghold of Lofoten, simply do not want to become whalers any more. Nor do they want to brave storm-tossed winter seas to net fortunes in cod, as their forebears have done for centuries. Instead, they aspire to safer, salaried jobs in distant cities or with the offshore oil industry, and they have been leaving their island communities in droves. READ: Container shipping; the secretive industry crucial to our existence[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10289821/Container-shipping-the-secretive-industry-crucial-to-our-existence.html] There is irony in this turn of events. For most of its history, Lofoten exerted a gravitational pull on the young and ambitious. In his 1921 coming-of-age classic The Last of the Vikings, the Norwegian novelist Johan Bojer described the island chain as ‘a land in the Arctic Ocean that all the boys along the coast dreamt of visiting some day, a land where exploits were performed, fortunes were made, and where fishermen sailed in a race with Death.’ For a few gold-rush months each year, millions of Atlantic cod migrate south from the Barents Sea to spawn among the reefs and shoals of Lofoten. Fishermen have been flocking here to cash in on the bonanza for more than 1,000 years. In addition to straddling one of the world’s richest fisheries, these islands are also blessed with a near-perfect climate for drying fish in the open air to make stockfish. This durable, highly nutritious cod jerky sustained the Vikings on their long voyages and became Norway’s most lucrative export in the Middle Ages. The immense wealth of the dried-cod trade, and the possibility that jackpot riches might await any man with a boat, courage and a bit of luck, lured fortune seekers by the thousands. Grainy photographs from the 1930s show Lofoten’s harbours jammed with boats. Nowadays factory trawlers from the big seafood companies in the south do the work of many boats, netting and processing a high percentage of the catch. Small family-owned boats that brought their catches to local merchants and kept the Lofoten villages alive have now become endangered species. The cod are still there, still in the millions, still a lucrative business. But as the older fishermen sell out and retire, seafood companies snap up their quotas for big money. Even the fishermen’s sons who want to carry on the family business may find their paths blocked by the cost of buying a boat and a quota – typically £500,000. ‘Banks don’t want to lend you that kind of money when you’re my age,’ says 22-year-old Odd Helge Isaksen, who nevertheless is determined to follow tradition and become a fisher­man. A resident of Røst, a close-knit island community at the heart of the Lofoten cod banks, Isaksen is making his way into the business the hard way, in an open boat hauling in cod one by one on handlines, in much the way his Viking forebears did 1,000 years ago. Such dedication is rare. In the past 10 years only Isaksen and one other young man on Røst have decided to pursue fishing as a career. ‘I’m one of the new Vikings,’ he jokes one bitterly cold evening as he motors into the harbour after a long day at sea. Coming in hours after the rest of the fleet returned, his boat is laden to the gunwales with hundreds of pounds of cod. Black Sabbath is blaring on his iPod as he steers his boat with one hand and updates his Facebook account on his mobile phone with the other. ‘My friends from school think it’s kind of funny that I decided to become a fisherman,’ Isaksen says. ‘But they sure are impressed with the money I’m making.’ Compared with Lofoten’s cod industry and its 1,000-year history, commercial whaling was a latecomer. ‘Whaling from boats was unknown in my grandfather’s day,’ recalls Oddvar Berntsen, now 83 and the last surviving resident of his fishing village. ‘The boats were just too small. Occasionally the villagers might kill a whale from shore if it came in close, but this was opportunistic, done for food.’ When commercial whaling finally arrived in Norway, it did so with a bang – literally. In the 1860s a Norwegian shipping and whaling magnate named Svend Foyn devised the grenade-tipped harpoon. It was a game-changer, thrusting Norway to the fore of the world’s whaling nations. READ: The men risking their lives for barnacles[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/10229339/Fortune-on-the-rocks-the-men-risking-their-lives-for-barnacles.html] Norway’s fishermen, however, blamed the new industry for poor catches during the 1870s, since whales were believed to drive schools of fish closer to shore, where fishermen in small boats could catch them. After a series of bitter disputes between fishermen and whalers, Norway became the first nation to ban whaling in its territorial waters, declaring a 10-year moratorium in 1904. From then on, Norway’s commercial whalers sought their quarry in the wider North Atlantic and in the rich waters of the Antarctic. At about the same time, the Lofoten fishing fleet began shifting from sail to engine. With their newfound mobility, some of the fishermen took up whaling as an additional means of putting food on the table – no small consideration later on during the Great Depression, when both cash and meat were scarce. The banner year for Lofoten’s whalers came in 1958, when 192 boats caught 4,741 minke whales. But change was already in the wind. By 1973, the year when Kristiansen bought his boat, the number of whalers had dropped by nearly half, and numbers have continued falling ever since. The reasons are more economic and social than ecological. The cost of hunting whales is high, and returns are low. Although fashionable restaurants in Oslo still offer whale steak, many Norwegian grocery shoppers regard the rich red meat as Depression-era food, or as un-ecofriendly, or perhaps worse still, as a novelty cuisine for tourists. And because of a variety of factors – including restrictions imposed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species – there is little export market. So although Norway’s government sets an annual quota of 1,286 minke whales, in practice whalers take far fewer (only 533 in 2011). Even some of Norway’s green groups, staunchly opposed to whaling on principle, are content these days to maintain a death watch for a way of life they expect to disappear within a generation. They can afford to wait it out. With the North Atlantic minke whale population estimated at a healthy 130,000 animals, Norway’s modest annual catch is considered highly sustainable. It is the whalers who are heading for extinction. The demise of whaling and the consolidation of the cod industry are changing the face of Lofoten, and nowhere is that change more glaring than at Skrova. A generation ago this was a thriving fishing port with no fewer than eight factories working overtime to process cod, herring and other fish. Fishing and whaling were booming then, and Skrova was the place to be. By the early 1980s the tiny community was deemed to have the highest percentage of millionaires in all of Norway. Wealthy factory owners and fishermen liked to take their ease on a dockside bench, which bemused locals christened the millionærbænken, or millionaires’ bench. The old bench is still there, weathered and worn, but most of the millionaires who sat on it were put out of business long ago by the seafood companies down south and their fleets of factory ships. All but one of Skrova’s fish factories have closed, most recently in 2000. With the loss of jobs, the island’s full-time population has dwindled to about 150. Only Ellingsen, an old family-run seafood company, remains in business. It is still prosperous, nowadays turning out 12,000 tons a year of its own locally farmed salmon and, for a few weeks each summer, buying whale meat from the handful of whalers who still work these waters. ‘To be honest, whale meat isn’t really commercial for us any more,’ says 42-year-old Ulf Christian Ellingsen, the third generation of his family to run the company. ‘We continue to buy it mainly out of respect for tradition and our old roots. My grandfather started this business in 1947 primarily as a whale-meat buyer. We’d like to keep that going for as long as we can.’ Skrova’s most significant export these days is not salmon or whale but the precious cargo that leaves on the passenger ferry to Svolvær every autumn – a small clutch of schoolchildren who have outgrown the island’s tiny community school and are obliged to pack their bags and leave home to attend the regional high school. For most of them, this introduction into the larger world is the start of a whole new life, one that leads away from Skrova. The five teenagers who depart Skrova this autumn will be followed by two more next year and another three the year after. And with no youngsters entering school at the other end of the line, the island’s already critically small community school will shrink still further. ‘We need to get more young families moving in here,’ says Ellingsen, whose own daughter, Aurora, is among this autumn’s group of teenage émigrés moving to Svolvær to continue their education. ‘I’d like to come back and retire here some day when I’m old,’ says 17-year-old June Kristin Hauvik, whose mother has worked in the Ellingsen fish factory for 35 years. For now, though, June Kristin is following in the footsteps of her two older sisters, both of whom are leading successful urban lives, one a doctor, the other a lawyer, worlds away from the sleepy island where they grew up. On a bright autumn afternoon, June Kristin and the other departing teenagers board the ferry and set off into the future, past the old millionaires’ bench, out beyond the headlands and into the wide open waters, where everything seems possible. * This article first appeared in National Geographic Creative"
Pentagon Releases Strategy For Arctic,Norway,"WASHINGTON -- As a shrinking northern ice cap sets the stage for increased competition over natural resources, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday released the Pentagon's first ''Arctic Strategy,'' intended to safeguard American security interests and the region's environment. Speaking at an international security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Mr. Hagel described the challenges facing the world as rising global temperatures shrink the polar ice and as Russia, China and other nations compete for economic opportunities and influence in the region. He noted that tourism, shipping and commercial fishing might gravitate toward new Arctic sea routes, but he underscored in particular what could happen as nations vied for the region's vast quantities of oil and gas. ''A flood of interest in energy exploration has the potential to heighten tensions over other issues,'' Mr. Hagel said. Multilateral security cooperation will be a priority, he added, as ''this will ultimately help reduce the risk of conflict.'' Although the Arctic is a region of established nations, including the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden, the polar north will be shaped by economic, political and security issues arising from elsewhere around the world, Mr. Hagel said. ''Among them are the growing economic and geopolitical importance of the Asia-Pacific; conflict and instability across the Middle East and North Africa; the unprecedented diffusion of global economic power; new sources of and demand for energy; the rise of China, India, Brazil and other nations; environmental degradation and devastating natural disasters; and the role of technology in closely linking the world's people, their aspirations and their grievances,'' he said. While ''climate change does not directly cause conflict,'' Mr. Hagel said, it may ''significantly add to the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict.'' He cited ''food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and more severe natural disasters.'' The Pentagon's Arctic strategy places a priority on preparations to detect, deter, prevent and defeat threats to the United States even as the nation ''will continue to exercise U.S. sovereignty in and around Alaska,'' Mr. Hagel said. The strategy calls for working with ''private and public sector partners,'' including the State of Alaska and federal agencies such as the Coast Guard, he added, ''to improve our understanding and awareness of the Arctic environment so that we can operate safely and effectively.'' The Defense Department also seeks to preserve freedom of the seas throughout the Arctic region. A new focus on the Arctic will require the Pentagon to reshape its infrastructure and capabilities in the region. ''We are beginning to think about and plan for how our naval fleet and other capabilities and assets will need to adapt to the evolving shifts and requirements in the region,'' the defense secretary said. The United States has about 27,000 military personnel from active-duty units, the National Guard and reserves stationed in the Arctic, in Alaska. C-130 transport planes equipped with skis for landing and takeoff are deployed there, and nuclear submarines routinely patrol the polar region."
Lebanon: Will Hold First Auction of Offshore Energy Licenses in Jan,Norway,"Lebanon plans to go ahead with its first auction of oil and natural gas licenses in its Mediterranean coastal waters next month, despite the government's failure to vote on decrees needed to start the bidding process, Energy Minister Gebran Bassil said Thursday The country has already deferred the licensing round from Nov. 4 to Dec. 10, and then Jan. 10, after the cabinet failed to approve two decrees, but Mr. Bassil said on his Twitter page that the auction will go ahead regardless of the political bickering that has yet to be resolved. ""We are determined to complete all the procedures on time...the tender will inevitably happen,"" he said. Lebanon has already short-listed 46 international oil firms to bid in the licensing round. ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) of the U.S., France's Total SA (TOT), Norway's Statoil ASA (STO), Anglo-Dutch multinational Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSA) and Italy's Eni SpA (E) are among 12 firms that pre-qualified as operators, according to Lebanon's Petroleum Administration. The administration also short-listed 34 firms as non-operators, including Korea National Oil Corp., Russia's OAO Rosneft (ROSN.RS) and Japan's Inpex Corp. (1605.TO). Lebanon, which passed an oil law in 2010 and formed a petroleum board last year, is opening prospects for exploration in the hope that sizeable discoveries will help it cut high levels of government debt and meet domestic power demands. Geophysical data covering the exploration area in the eastern Mediterranean indicate the region contains several trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The tiny Mediterranean country faces economic and fiscal challenges that are contributing to its mounting public debt. Insecurity relating to threats from across its borders with Syria and Israel, as well as internal political instability that could jeopardize foreign investments and tourism, have contributed to the country's hardship. By the end of July last year, Lebanon's gross public debt stood at $55.4 billion, or 136.4% of gross domestic product, according to the Association of Banks in Lebanon.

The grab for Greenland,Norway,"On a hill above the old harbour, Hans Egede braves biting winds to keep watch over the town he founded three centuries ago. Bearing the commission of King Frederick IV of Denmark, the Lutheran pastor pitched up in Greenland in 1721. He planned to bring the Reformation to Norse settlers in this vast, frozen territory. As Egede navigated the ice fjords, he discovered his European kin had long since left in search of more clement climes. Undeterred, he set about preaching the Protestant faith to the native Inuit, supplying Greenlandic with a Latin alphabet to promote study of the scriptures. Egede's mission established itself in Godthab (Good Hope) on the southwest coast of the island. Church was soon followed by trade and later by the state. Denmark - then a European power with imperial ambitions - acquired a colony. Greenland is once again catching the imagination of outsiders. International business executives and diplomats are retracing Egede's journey. The rapid melting of the northern polar ice has set off something of a scramble for the resources buried below. By US estimates, the Arctic may hold 13 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 per cent of its untapped gas as well as untold mineral resources. The London-based think-tank Chatham House talks of an Arctic ""cold rush"". Greenland, a frozen and mostly empty sprawl of a country reaching up from the Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean, sees a chance to reclaim its pre-colonial identity. ""I guess we are in the business of nation-building,"" says Vittus Qujaukitsoq, the minister of economy in a government with its sights on independence. Egede's statue stares across the ice-speckled harbour to a cluster of timber-framed buildings housing the National Museum. Greenland has wrested autonomy from Copenhagen, and visitors to the museum's store of historic artefacts are left in little doubt about the colonial record. The hunting paraphernalia, furs, native art and wood-framed kayaks describing the harshness of polar life are accompanied by a commentary that excoriates the interlopers. Christianity and colonisation brought ""crucial ruptures . . . in the lifestyle and thinking of the Inuit"". The ""master race"" corralled the indigenous people into new settlements to better supply Denmark with the spoils of sealing, whaling and fishing. The Inuit were robbed of their spiritual compass as well as their physical freedom. The museum records this story in Greenlandic and in English - not in Danish, until recently the country's official language. Daniel Thorleifsen, the quietly spoken curator, brushes off my suggestion of bias in his museum's celebration of the ancient crafts of the Inuit alongside its distinctly cooler assessment of the modernity imported from Denmark. ""We are telling the history correctly. How the exploitation happened. This is not a matter of opinion,"" he says. The narrative of repression represents ""a simple statement of fact"". This was a sentiment I heard often in Greenland, sometimes from those of Danish as well as Inuit heritage. These lingering anti-colonial resentments have fired nationalist ambitions. Now they are fusing with rising hopes that Greenland is in sight of an economic boom. Isolated by Denmark, Greenland caught a brief glimpse of the outside world when Americans arrived during the second world war to deny Hitler's Germany an Atlantic foothold. During its nuclear stand-off with the Soviet Union, Washington stationed bombers at Thule in the far freezing north. But for the most part, Greenland has been a place the rest of the world passed by. Air travellers might glance at the dazzling, ice-sculpted terrain while crossing the Atlantic. Bands of explorers and scientists ventured north to explore the high polar terrain or to drill deep into the ice core to trace the progress of climate change. Intrepid tourists marvelled at the icebergs spilling from its glaciers into the open sea. But Greenland's frozen nothingness made international headlines only when its hunters and whalers rebelled against the save-a-seal environmentalism of the European Union. Things are changing. Two of the big forces shaping the world's geopolitical contours are global warming and the voracious appetite for raw materials of the world's big emerging markets. Both converge on Greenland's retreating ice-sheet. What happens next in the Arctic will touch the security and prosperity of the rest of the planet. ""The world is paying attention to Greenland,"" says Jens-Erik Kirkegaard, the government minister in charge of minerals and mining development, with more than a hint of satisfaction. Climate change is remaking the Arctic, opening up new transpolar trade routes and offering tantalising sight of the energy and mineral resources beneath the unforgiving tundra. The impact is being felt in changing global weather patterns, migrating fish stocks and rising seas as far away as Asia and, crucially, in the calculations of the world's great powers. Huge blocks of ice from Greenland's glaciers spill into the Atlantic currents through the Kangia Fjord. The discovery of iron ore, zinc, gold and much else has attracted prospectors from as far away as Australia. Deposits of rare earth materials could challenge China's grip on the global trade in the valuable metallic elements vital to today's technological gadgetry. Greenlanders dream that the seabed beyond its northern coast might one day yield hydrocarbons to rival the riches on the slopes of Alaska. ""Climate change,"" Qujaukitsoq says, ""is a new opportunity for Greenland."" Greenland isn't green. Not much of it, anyway. During the short summer a scattering of sheep peer down from the coastal hills to the ice floes below, but some 80 per cent of the two million square kilometres of territory (an area almost four times that of France) is sheeted with ice. The people - about 56,000 hardy souls at the latest count - mostly huddle together in small towns and settlements on the southwestern coastline. As the writer Sara Wheeler notes in her magnificent chronicle of the modern polar region, The Magnetic North, the country was given its name by Erik Thorvaldsson, more popularly known as Eric the Red. Arriving from Iceland during the 10th century, Erik had a 21st-century copywriter's eye for marketing. ""Gronland"", he thought, would conjure up images of fertile plains and draw in European settlers. This part of the world has known big changes in climate before. Warming temperatures during the eighth and ninth centuries brought Inuit tribes from Alaska and northern Canada - the Thule - who displaced the now-disappeared Dorset peoples in the frozen north. The Norse settlers arrived in the more temperate south. By the 15th century, however, the mercury was falling again. The Norse disappeared, leaving behind the Inuit who, kept warm by the skins of their prey, could scratch a subsistence life by fishing or hunting whales, walruses, seals and musk oxen. . . . The latest change in the weather pattern is faster and more pronounced. Arctic temperatures have been rising twice as fast as elsewhere. The polar region has lost about three-quarters of its sea ice. This summer the White House published a US strategy for the region. The warming trend, it said, ""is unlike anything previously recorded. The reduction in sea ice has been dramatic, abrupt, and unrelenting."" This had the potential ""to transform global climate and ecosystems as well as global shipping, energy markets and other commercial interests"". The prospects were for the opening of hitherto unnavigable sea passages from Asia to Europe and from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The thaw could make accessible ""vast quantities of mineral resources, including rare earths, emeralds, iron ore and nickel"". So Greenland finds itself at the heart of one of the 21st century's big geopolitical games: the race to stake out territory and interests in the world's last ungoverned space. One outcome may be a free-for-all in which competing states fight it out above and below the ice for control of trade routes and resources. Another, enshrined in the ambitions of the eight-nation Arctic Council, would see the creation of a unique structure of international co-operation charged with defusing tensions and safeguarding the unique ecology. For now, there are pointers in both directions. The council - comprising the five Arctic Ocean littoral states of the US, Russia, Canada, Norway and Denmark (representing Greenland), along with Sweden, Finland and Iceland - started out as a body preoccupied with the environment, marine safety and the rights of indigenous peoples. More recently it has developed a broader political remit. The so-called Arctic Five have agreed that disputes about maritime boundaries will be settled peacefully under the terms of the United Nations convention on the law of the sea. The Scandinavian members of the council see a chance to create an unprecedented model of ""preventative diplomacy"". Whether such goodwill outlasts serious contact with conflicting claims to mineral resources and shipping rights is a tougher question. In 2007, Moscow dispatched a submarine to plant the Russian national flag below the North Pole, thereby underscoring its claim to vast tracts of the Arctic seabed. Norway, usually nothing if not avowedly multilateral, has strengthened its military forces in the Arctic region and hosts regular exercises for Nato troops in the high north. Normally placid Canada is boisterously nationalistic about its polar territory where it is embroiled in disputes with Washington about shipping rights in the Beaufort Sea. The US, which after the second world war tried and failed to buy Greenland from Denmark (in 1917 it had completed a similar transaction with Copenhagen to secure ownership of what are now the US Virgin Islands), has only quite recently woken up to the broader strategic significance of the Arctic. US secretaries of state, who had previously deputed their juniors to handle the region, now make a point of turning up at the regular ministerial gatherings of the Arctic Council. The power plays reach beyond governments with an obvious territorial stake in the region. China rebranded itself a ""near-Arctic"" state some time ago. After an intense diplomatic campaign - which Russia failed to scupper - Beijing has secured a seat as an observer on the Arctic. It has signed free-trade and economic agreements with financially beleaguered Iceland in what western governments see as an attempt to establish an Arctic staging post. ""China wants to buy it,"" says one western diplomat bluntly of Beijing's courtship of Reykjavik. With an eye on potential mineral resources, Beijing may send up to 3,000 workers to open an iron ore mine in Greenland. All this stirs anxiety in Washington. ""If China is paying attention,"" a US official says, ""we cannot afford not to."" The pace of change in the Arctic will be slower than imagined by some excited commentators. If chunks of Greenland's glaciers now turn up as icebergs in the Caribbean, the polar region still has an awful lot of ice. China may have sent a cargo vessel to traverse the Arctic sea route above northern Russia - cutting weeks off the journey through the Suez Canal - but traffic is seasonal and negligible in comparison with traditional routes. It will be decades before the polar seaways challenge the Suez and Panama canals. Digging out minerals and pumping oil will be fraught with environmental and technical hazards. The terrain is inhospitable, communications difficult and mining operations expensive. The Inuit inhabitants of Alaska, Canada and Greenland are also determined to have their say. Geopolitics does not wait for the future. Governments, businesses and NGOs are rushing to stake out ground. China has been joined as an observer on the Arctic Council by India, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Italy - all states that consider they have an interest in access to new Arctic resources and trade routes. An international organisation that started out as a sleepy backwater for boffins and environmentalists has become an arena for strategic competition. Greenland's politicians may soon enough discover that climate change poses as many risks as it holds promises for a nation that wants to reclaim a vanishing identity. . . . Danish Godthab, the capital, was renamed Greenlandic Nuuk in 1979 when Greenlanders demanded autonomy from Copenhagen. A home rule agreement in that year laid the foundations for a comprehensive self-government accord in 2009. This repatriated Denmark's remaining powers over domestic policy, leaving foreign affairs and security to Copenhagen. Greenland took full control of its economy, including the mineral and hydrocarbon resources, while remaining, like the Faroe Islands (another former colony lying between Denmark and Iceland) part of the ""Danish realm"". Fights with European environmentalists about seal and whale hunting and fishing rights had already prompted Greenland to quit the European Union, though Denmark remains an EU member. Nuuk is at once a capital city and a village. The jumble of pretty clapboard houses rising up from the rocks above the harbour gives way to a sprawl of flimsy, badly worn apartment blocks that might have been designed by an architect of the Soviet school. This is not an elegant town. The 16,000 or so residents are served by a couple of small shopping centres, while a swelling band of business and diplomatic visitors converge on a single hotel. The city's bars are often full - long, dark winter nights, high unemployment and a culture of living-for-the-moment make for a disturbing tradition of heavy drinking. Sisimiut and Ilulissat, the next largest population centres, each have about 5,000 residents. Most Greenlanders live in towns of a thousand or two. In the far north, a typical settlement is home to a hundred or less. There are no roads connecting this scattering of communities. The ice and the distances preclude even rudimentary highways. A single vessel of the state-owned shipping line plies its trade up and down the western coastline each week but people and products mostly get around by plane and helicopter. Everything rests on the weather-defying feats of Air Greenland. Given the freezing weather, feats they are. Christian Keldsen, the airline's chief commercial officer, showed me around the hangars at Nuuk airport as a group of engineers stripped down one of half a dozen Dash turboprops. The flying warhorses are built for tough conditions but the mechanics wielded their wrenches with surgical care. Everything is checked, double checked and then checked again, every nut and bolt scrupulously accounted for. The brutal conditions facing the pilots leave no room for mistakes. An hour to the north, Kangerlussuaq serves as Air Greenland's communications hub and the country's lifeline to the outside world. Built by the Americans, the runway is one of only two long enough for long-range jets. For most of the year the airline runs a daily service to Copenhagen. A ramshackle cluster of shops and homes assembled in wood and corrugated steel stands in dismal relief to the dazzling mountains that rise from the runway. In winter, temperatures here drop below -40C. A rickety hotel beside the single terminal is a reminder that even the sturdiest of aircraft must sometimes bow to the forces of nature. The precariousness of this life - the mainstays of the economy are fishing and a small, though burgeoning tourism industry, and more than half of the government budget comes in the form of a subsidy from Copenhagen - has not dampened the enthusiasm of local politicians for independence. Economy minister Qujaukitsoq says climate warming gives the country the chance to ""create our own economy - firstly by rebuilding our fishing industry, secondly by creating a mining industry and thirdly with tourism"". Lest anyone think there is a shortage of riches, he reels them off: ""gold, silver, platinum, palladium, zinc, iron, copper, rare earths, lead, to name just a few we know for certain Greenland has in large quantities"". Kirkegaard, the mining minister, welcomes the world's attention. The government has lifted a decades-old ban on the mining of uranium which had applied even when the material was collected as an unavoidable byproduct. The Australian-based Greenland Minerals and Energy describes the move as a ""transformative event"" which opens up huge potential for the mining of rare earths in southern Greenland. Kirkegaard says the timing for such developments is perfect - the demand for resources from the swelling middle classes of the emerging nations comes at the moment an investor spotlight has turned to the Arctic. There are plenty of other places with untapped resources but ""Greenland is strategically in a good place. The rule of law applies. It is a democratic country where you can trust the courts and laws. That's important for mining companies."" It will take time to locate the oil and gas reserves but Shell, Maersk, Statoil and Cairn Energy are among companies with drilling licences. For now, says Kirkegaard, ""You know it's there, but not quite where."" . . . There is a Klondike quality about all this. Every summer a pilgrimage of prospectors arrives in search of gold, silver, diamond and ruby deposits. Some of them stay. In Nuuk, Joshua Hughes, a Welsh-born geologist, took me to lunch. He had been visiting Greenland for years, he explained, before deciding to settle in the capital. He is a man with the gleam of riches in his eye. As chief geologist for NunaMinerals, Hughes has been digging for gold; and he is sure he has discovered it. Nuna, he says, has found a valuable seam in southern Greenland, and is raising funds on the Toronto Stock Exchange to finance commercial exploitation. Greenland's future, though, may hang on one big deal. The British-based London Mining heads a consortium that wants to establish an iron ore mine at Isua, 100 miles north of Nuuk. Once in operation, this single project would have an output worth a staggering $2bn a year - equivalent to Greenland's present national income. To build the facility and a nearby deep-sea port, London Mining plans to bring in Chinese capital and up to 3,000 Chinese workers. Surveys and negotiations have dragged on over years but 2013 saw a breakthrough in talks with the government. In what Kirkegaard terms a ""historic moment"", London Mining secured a 30-year licence to exploit the ore. More cautious voices say ministers are getting carried away by such heady optimism. The government's nationalist rhetoric, diplomats say, collides with some harsh realities. Greenland lacks the infrastructure, the people and the resources to rush into independence. If Denmark was once a rapacious colonial power, Greenland now depends on Copenhagen's financial benevolence. There are questions too about Aleqa Hammond, the feisty leader of the Simuit party, who won this year's general election to become Greenland's first woman prime minister. Hammond, local business leaders observe, looked a more convincing figure on the campaign trail than in government. Some draw unflattering comparisons between Hammond and Kuupik Kleist, her predecessor and the leader of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Kleist earned a reputation as a ""grown-up"", a politician brave enough to take unpopular decisions to sort out the public finances and modernise an outdated fishing industry. For all its commitment to independence the government struggles to shake off an air of amateurism - a sense that inexperienced ministers have not quite grasped the complexities and risks of the geopolitical game now being played in the Arctic. Much of the work of administration still falls to officials born or trained in Denmark, while, perversely, Hammond's vote-winning pledges have increased Greenland's financial dependence on Copenhagen. Kleist's Inuit Ataqatigiit party spearheaded calls for independence during the 1970s and 1980s and he remains committed to the goal. But he warns that the country lacks the financial and human capital to cut itself adrift any time soon. The problems lie not only in numbers - though finding the people to govern a state from a population of only 56,000 will never be easy - but in low educational attainment and high unemployment. Nuuk boasts a small, bustling university but many children leave school with only minimal qualifications. There is no point, Kleist says, ""in yelling in the streets for independence if you do not know how to get there"". Climate change carries opportunities - everything has been moving north, including valuable fish stocks, but you have to build ""your own nation to be strong enough to take care of itself"". The cold rush throws up a profound paradox. The world's rediscovery of the Arctic, like Egede's landing in Greenland, promises economic and social upheaval. Climate change threatens to elbow aside what remains of the precious traditions honoured in Daniel Thorleifsen's museum. The number of native hunters in Greenland's high north has fallen to less than a thousand. They are growing old and, as the ice melts, their children are moving south. Climate change offers a platform for independence but it will not turn back history. It will more likely force Greenlanders to decide who they are. Centuries of intermingling and intermarriage have blurred the boundary between Greenlandic and Inuit. Greenlanders of mixed or mostly Danish heritage say they too would like independence but they don't look to the past for their future. There are those in Hammond's government who say it is time to close the colonial chapter by retiring Egede from his towering vantage point. The irony is they are not at all sure what they would put in his place. ------------------------------------------- Philip Stephens is the FT's chief political commentator.

Nations jockey for Arctic position,Norway,"WASHINGTON • The U.S. is racing to keep pace with stepped-up activity in the once-sleepy Arctic frontier, but it is far from being in the lead. Nations across the world are hurrying to stake claims to the Arctic’s resources, which might be home to 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its untapped natural gas. There are emerging fisheries and hidden minerals. Cruise liners loaded with tourists are sailing the Arctic’s frigid waters in increasing numbers. Cargo traffic along the Northern Sea Route, one of two shortcuts across the top of the Earth in summer, is on the rise. The U.S., which takes over the two-year rotating chairmanship of the eight-nation Arctic Council in 2015, has not ignored the Arctic, but critics say the U.S. is lagging behind the seven others: Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Denmark, through the semiautonomous territory of Greenland. “On par with the other Arctic nations, we are behind — behind in our thinking, behind in our vision,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. “We lack basic infrastructure, basic funding commitments to be prepared for the level of activity expected in the Arctic.” At a meeting before Thanksgiving with Secretary of State John Kerry, Murkowski suggested he name a U.S. ambassador or envoy to the Arctic — someone who could coordinate work on the Arctic being done by more than 20 federal agencies and take the lead on increasing U.S. activities in the region. Murkowski is trying to get Americans to stop thinking that the Arctic is just Alaska’s concern. The melting Arctic also is creating a new front of U.S. security concerns. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said expanding Russia’s military presence in the Arctic was a top priority for his nation’s armed forces."
"The loonie's overdue landing; Reality is bringing Canada's dollar back to earth, but much of the damage is permanent",Norway,"Economist with Unifor, Canada's largest private sector trade union The past year has seen a substantial U-turn in Canada's dollar. A year ago, it was trading near $1.02 (U.S.). Tuesday, it settled around 93 cents – a 9 per cent decline. This is a welcome but overdue reversal to a decade-long updraft. From 2002 through 2007, the loonie shot up more than 60 per cent. Since then, it's bounced around par with the greenback. Now, it's finally heading back down. Most economists think the slide will continue, potentially falling below 90 cents this year. At or near par with the U.S. dollar, the loonie was substantially overvalued by any fundamental measure. The most common way to estimate the “fair value” of a currency is according to relative price levels in different countries – what economists call “purchasing power parity.” On this basis, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development pegs the loonie's benchmark at 81 cents (U.S.). Temporary factors such as investor expectations, big financial flows or unusual success in export markets can push the exchange rate away from its fair value – for a while. But even waterfowl can't stay aloft forever, and it's been clear for years that the loonie would have to come back to earth. At par, the inflated dollar was making Canadian-made goods and services artificially expensive to foreign buyers, a cost penalty of about 25 per cent. Consequently, anything we sold to foreigners (other than resources, which are usually priced in U.S. dollars) was priced out of the market. In 2004, I published a report predicting the loss of 400,000 manufacturing jobs if the dollar stayed above 85 cents (U.S.). It turns out my guess was conservative: Almost 500,000 have disappeared since the currency took off. And it's not just manufacturing that suffered from this flight of fancy. Other export-oriented sectors got hammered even harder. Tourist visits to Canada, for example, have plunged by almost half since 2000 (from almost 50 million per year to just 25 million), reflecting Canada's status as one of the most expensive destinations in the world. Border towns were devastated; southbound cross-border shopping made matters worse. Indeed, Canada's overall trade performance was among the worst in the world during the loonie's manic flight. Exports plunged from 44 per cent of GDP in 2000 to just 30 per cent last year, making a mockery of the federal government's supposed trade agenda. Combined with surging imports, this produced an enormous deficit in international payments: more than $60-billion last year, the highest in Canadian history. Since late 2008, our debt to the rest of the world has grown by $290-billion. (That's twice as much as the growth in federal government debt over the same period.) Unfortunately, Canadian policy-makers (including Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and successive governors of the Bank of Canada) endorsed the dollar's rise – even celebrated it, perversely. Unlike other countries that intervene to manage exchange rates (such as Norway, Australia, Switzerland, Brazil, China and Japan), Canadian authorities let the currency float wherever markets took it. Now, finally, Canada's miserable trade performance is sinking into traders' consciousness, and the loonie's flight is reversing. Several factors combined to drive the loonie back toward earth last year. After clearly inflating the dollar over the past decade, the bitumen boom lost some steam in the face of infrastructure and political constraints. Short-term “hot money” inflows have turned tail, as the Bank of Canada softened its stance on interest rates. Other central banks had been purchasing loonies as part of their own currency interventions, but that buying pressure is now easing, too. The dollar's softening is welcome, but needs to go further (toward the OECD's benchmark) to restore true balance. Unfortunately, much of the damage from the past decade will be permanent. Many industrial jobs that left Canada won't come back, even if the dollar returns to normal. And global companies worry that if currency traders are infected by another bout of loonie-mania (sparked by oil prices or some other cause), our government will go along with it, destroying competitiveness in the process. So while I welcome every downward tick, I won't be popping champagne corks. Canadian policy-makers haven't learned the lessons of this pointless, destructive escapade, which means it could happen all again."
"Lebanon Delays Offshore Energy Auction for Third and Last Time, Minister Says",Norway,"Lebanon has again delayed its first auction of oil and natural gas licenses in its coastal waters after the government repeatedly failed to vote on decrees needed to start the bidding process, the country's energy minister said Wednesday. The auction will now be held three months later than scheduled on April 10, instead of this Friday, Gebran Bassil said in a statement, but vowed that the bidding round will go ahead regardless of whether it has government backing. ""It is sad for Lebanon to postpone this tender for the third time and this will certainly lead to a lack of trust and a lack of seriousness among the companies,"" Mr. Bassil said. Lebanon had twice deferred the licensing round--from Nov. 4 to Dec. 10, and then to Jan. 10--after the cabinet failed to approve two decrees. Mr. Bassil insisted that his ministry was willing to launch the bidding on its own in April even if no new government had been formed and the current caretaker administration failed to agree on the decrees. Lebanon's previous government resigned in March over political and sectarian tensions, mainly because of the Syrian war. Opposing parties have been locked in negotiations over forming a cabinet, with an important issue being the representation of Hezbollah, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The small country's political system is based on proportional representation for religious communities. The subsequent power vacuum has heightened a sense of insecurity and fears over growing radicalism and violence. Lebanon has already shortlisted 46 international oil firms to bid for the licenses in Mediterranean waters. Geophysical data covering the exploration area in the eastern Mediterranean indicate the region contains several trillion cubic feet of natural gas ExxonMobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. of the U.S., French oil company Total SA, Statoil ASA of Norway, Anglo-Dutch multinational Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Eni SpA of Italy are among 12 firms that prequalified as operators, according to Lebanon's Petroleum Administration. The administration also shortlisted 34 firms as non-operators, including Korea National Oil Corp., Russia's OAO Rosneft and Inpex Corp. of Japan. Lebanon, which passed an oil law in 2010 and formed a petroleum board last year, is opening prospects for exploration in the hope that sizable discoveries will help it meet domestic power demands and cut high government debt levels, which have been compounded by external factors and internal political insecurity that could jeopardize foreign investment and tourism.

"Same old, same old on jobs",Norway,"Re: Canada hit by unexpected rise in jobless rate, Jan. 10 Re: PM backs Tory bill critics call ‘witch hunt,' Jan. 14 Re: Flaherty should not be complacent in face of job numbers, Jan. 13 Canada hit by unexpected rise in jobless rate, Jan. 10 When asked about the December job losses, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty lamely trots out his usual PMO-approved talking point that we must “keep taxes low to create the environment where job creation can flourish.” Translation: Slash government. Not just hogwash, sir — stale hogwash! Taxes are already low enough. It is the continual bleeding by mass employers that drive these kinds of losses, like plant closures announced by Kellogg in London, Heinz at Leamington, CCL Industries in Penetanguishine and others that have already occurred over the past several years, including the steel industry. True, many closures are in Ontario, but that’s because that province traditionally formed our industrial heartland. Indeed, some jobs are lost because of technology but the majority are because U.S. head offices are taking jobs back to the U.S. or other firms are moving to low-wage countries that Canadians can never compete with, with labour rates as low as $1 a day, such as the garment industry. If the Conservative government in Ottawa is serious about job creation, it will formulate and actively promote an industrial strategy for Canada, one that goes beyond the Alberta tar sands and the oil industry. Elsewhere, tinkering with a few high-tech projects may create a relative handful of well-paying work but not the thousands of jobs and steady wages that industry can provide. The Tories demonstrated that they knew this sort of thing could work when they pumped life-saving public funding into GM of Canada and Chrysler Canada when those two industrial titans were threatened with bankruptcy. It’s that or reverse course on slashing government, the only other mass employment sector we have left. In the end, it seems the Harper government is rendered impotent on jobs creation by its own narrow-minded ideology based on fantasy and blind to the reality of our preventable national decline. Brad Savage, Scarborough If the Harper Conservatives were serious about job creation, they would not rely entirely on the whims of private sector hiring. In 1944, Canada’s unemployment rate dropped below 1 per cent because one out of every three adult males was engaged in military service and many private sector workers were fulfilling government contracts. As the British politician Tony Benn put it, “If you can have full employment by killing Germans, why can’t we have it by building hospitals, schools, recruiting nurses and teachers? If you can find money to kill people, you can find money to help people.” In the 1970s the Liberal government experimented with direct job creation delivered through local organizations and citizen groups. The Local Initiatives Program successfully hired in areas such as arts and culture, recreation, tourism, research and protecting the environment. The federal government needs to renew these initiatives. With double-digit unemployment currently among youth, do we really want a generation of young people living without incomes, without job experience, and without an opportunity to contribute to society? Larry Kazdan, Vancouver Harper should take economics lesson from Henry Ford, Opinion Jan. 14 The front page of the Jan. 13 Star reported that the Harper Tories had decided and then decided not to “contract out” trade policy making. On the Opinion page, Toby Sanger pointed out that Henry Ford knew a lot more about jobs and prosperity than Harper and Flaherty seem to do. How much longer are we going to go along with the idea that Harper and Co. have any economic policies at all except for using up non-renewable resources as fast as possible and lowering incomes, both of which look more like economic suicide than salvation? Julie Beddoes, Toronto PM backs Tory bill critics call ‘witch hunt,' Jan. 14 It seems to me that the new proposed Bill C-520 is not necessary. All the Harper government needs to do is to advertise the watchdog and staff positions with some truth in advertising. An ad along the lines of the one below would, I believe satisfy their requirements. Wanted Watchdog for future government spending: This position requires experience in budget control, an inquiring mind, hard work, tenacity and the ability to express sympathy to Canadian taxpayers. The position will report to the PMO and the incumbent will be ever mindful of the suggestion, wishes and hopes of this office. This completion is open to all Canadians except that: Members or former members of the Liberal, Bloc Quebec, Green and NDP parties, armed forces veterans, First Nations People, unemployed people on reduced EI, Environmental activist, and wimpy Red Tories need not apply. Keith Parkinson, Cambridge I had my laugh of the morning with the reason for Bill C-520. Mr. Harper wants accountability and transparency. Saturday Night Live should pick this up for a good skit, would get a load of laughs. What a joke. William Arsenault, Napanee Tony Sanger may be correct in his analysis that Harper should take a lesson in economics from Henry Ford. Harper should also take a lesson in political ethics (is that an oxymoron?) from regular Canadians, but that’s a topic for another time. However, Sanger’s preamble to his proposition is flawed and lessens the impact of his message. I have seen no empirical evidence to suggest that higher wages alone reduce turnover or for that matter absenteeism.As a matter of fact the exact opposite may be true. As public sector unions negotiated more and more paid annual sick days for their members there was a lockstep increase in absenteeism. Was it a coincidence that a legion of letter carriers all took ill at the same time during the recent cold weather surrounding Christmas? Comparing a $5 a day wage back in 1914 to a $16 an hour wage today without taking into account the cost of benefits leads to a faulty comparison. Back in 1914 the Ford workers, out of their own pockets, paid their doctors, pharmacists, optometrists, chiropractors, physiotherapists, lawyers, etc. for themselves and their families. They had no pensions, no funeral pay, no paid sick days, no personal paid days, no accident insurance, certainly not 12 paid stat holidays or four weeks annual vacation (on average) or generous overtime pay, call in pay and the list could go on. It has to increase their compensation package by 50 per cent and by omitting it Sanger subjects the comparison to criticism and potentially loses readers before they finish the article. Frank Feeley, Fonthill If only our Ottawa would employ all those out of work, we could readily recoup all those job losses in Ontario from GM Diesel (London), Heinz (Leamington), Nortel (Toronto), Stelco (Hamilton), and so many more plants throughout a province that somehow found money for needless wind turbines and a hundred million for a gas plant that never was in Oakville. But Ottawa has chosen to not copy Greece’s example in hiring some 20 per cent of the population, and contrary to your editorial which unabashedly blames Ottawa, those job losses more reflect the mismanagement at our provincial level by a current and predecessor premier who — unlike Ottawa — believed they could spend their way out of economic trouble, and let future generations struggle to pay for our misdeeds. The wisdom of relieving ourselves of debt is found no further than a few pages later (5 rules for financial success in “Slaying the Debt Dragon,” Business and Personal Finance, page 1), where Adam Meyers writes, “Spend Less than You Earn” — something our aging parents well understood a few generations ago. If only our provincial finance minister could do what federal minister Flaherty is doing with getting out of debt, we might just have a vote-worthy leader for a change. R. Michaels, Burlington Flaherty should not be complacent in face of job numbers, Jan. 13 The best way for finance minister Jim Flaherty to reverse Canada’s disastrous de-industrialization is to stop taxing jobs, businesses and sales. We tax cigarettes and alcohol to discourages their use, so it follows that income taxes are a tax on employment while sales taxes make products less affordable for many, translating into fewer local manufacturing jobs. To address this job-killing double whammy, the federal government should shift taxation off of the productive economy and on to the non-productive economy. Most taxes should be on the use and abuse of nature, which would result in a double bonus of creating jobs plus conserving resources for future generations. For example, Canada should collect the economic rent of oil, a policy that has effectively made all the citizens of Norway into millionaires, without discouraging their oil industry. Contrast this with Canada, where oil companies are allowed to pocket most oil super profits, putting Canadians, collectively, deeply in debt and out of work. Frank de Jong, President, Earthsharing Canada There are several things wrong with the Harper government’s never-ending claims that they are brilliant tax cutters. To start with, it’s untrue. Their first fiscal decision after taking office in 2006 was to increase personal income taxes. Later that fall, they imposed a toxic new Conservative tax on income trusts, which obliterated $25 billion from the savings accounts of 2 million ordinary Canadians. More recently, Mr. Harper has increased the overall federal tax burden in each of his last four budgets — taxing everything from hospital parking fees and cosmetic wigs for cancer patients to local credit unions and job creation. Conservative claims about lower taxes for families need a scrupulous reality check. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty says they are “saving the average family of four more than $3,100 a year in tax.”[http://www.fin.gc.ca/n13/13-017_1-eng.asp]But it all depends on what type of “family” you’re talking about. You can construct an illustration that would fit the Conservative model — with two parents, two children, a six-figure income and consumer spending of more than $50,000 every year (including over a thousand dollars for art lessons). But for most families — in fact, for 70 per cent of Canadian families — this is simply not their reality. The vast majority of middle-class Canadians haven’t seen a significant improvement in their real incomes for the better part of 30 years. But their living costs have gone up and debt-loads have ballooned. For every dollar of disposable income, Canadians are carrying $1.64 in household debt. Many are concerned about affording post-secondary education for their kids, or having no pension plan at their place of employment, or finding decent childcare or long-term care for their parents. Nearly three-quarters of Canadians worry that their children will not do as well as they have done. And then there’s Mr. Harper’s new federal debt burden to take into account. He has run six consecutive deficits so far, adding more than $165-billion to Canada’s overall debt-load. That works out to $5,000 in new Conservative debt for every man, woman and child in this country, or $20,000 for every family of four. Any tax cuts claimed by Mr. Harper are paid for with borrowed money. So there is no room to be complacent about the needs of Canada’s middle-class and all those striving so hard just to get there. Ralph Goodale, MP (Wascana), former finance minister (2003-6), Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada The Star’s reminder that 2013 was the worse year for job growth in Canada since the recession in 2008-9, is not made more acceptable by an independent report about employment growth from 2008-12. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD ) released one based on 34 countries. When population growth was factored in, we finished 20th. Not quite the message intended by some $135 million spent on advertising to assure us about a capable economic action plan to produce jobs, growth and opportunity. A second OECD report had us 32nd of 34 in job security. We often do have a choice based on buying into spin versus independent reports. The question remains: will we remember come election time next year. Richard Ring, Grimsby Many people suggest Stephen Harper is an economist and imply this raises him to some higher level than the average citizen. Every month, statistics are announced on which high-paid economists have made their predictions and there is invariably a corollary that records the surprise of those same economists who appear like deer caught in the headlights as they are momentarily interviewed. In December 2013, employment dropped by 45,900 of which 37,900 had been self-employed. Politicians tell us that small businesses drive job creation and surely self-employed people are the ultimate small business or perhaps the desperate refuge of the unemployed. There has been little or no commentary about this occurrence. Was this an example of big companies temporarily shedding their “contractors” only to hire them back in 2014, which will be claimed as job creation, or were these jobs sent offshore? The much advertised Action Plan is seen to be no plan no action. Geoffrey Kemp, Mississauga When we are told that Canada lost almost 50,000 jobs, with Ontario accounting for a disproportionate 80 per cent, is it not clear that Kathleen Wynne and her team are part of the problem? She may have some weak-kneed politicians in her hip pocket but in the boardroom of public opinion, she could be doing a much better job of representing the taxpayers of Ontario — yes the folks she has been entrusted to represent. Lack of foresight, particularly with our dismal energy policy are proof that greed and stupidity simply do not mix! Brian Weller, Markham"
"Northern lights; Constitutional innovation? Unnecessary sovereignty? A new Klondike? Columnist Doug Saunders convenes The Globe's own ‘Arctic circle' to consider the perceptions, risks, responsibilities and even the language of Canada's relationship with its land and peoples in the North. Some of their answers may surprise you",Norway,"'FROZEN TREASURE CHEST' Doug Saunders: Just 100,000 Canadians – about 0.3 per cent of us – live in the three northern territories. What do southerners most misunderstand about the Canadian North? Mary Simon: I would like more Canadians to understand and value what it means to be an “Arctic nation.” Some years ago, when I was president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (Canada's national Inuit organization), I toured the country making presentations to Canadians on why the Arctic matters. The Canadian Arctic is the homeland of Inuit and other aboriginal peoples, and comprises a large part of the geography of our country. It is not, as a former minister of Indian Affairs mused, our “frozen treasure chest.” There is no other region in Canada that faces the breadth of complex environmental, social and political issues found today in the Arctic. Like all Canadians, Inuit are working hard to feed our families and live comfortably, and we want our children to succeed in school and find meaningful work. To achieve a lifestyle comparable to other Canadians, Inuit must be involved and truly benefit from resource development, and not at the cost of the environment that families still draw a livelihood around. Tony Penikett: The 20 or so northern land-claims settlements negotiated since 1973. Few Canadians realize the scale of these treaties. For 7,000 First Nations people in the Yukon, the treaties recognize title to 41,000 square kilometres (along with subsurface rights on two-thirds of that land), which is more land than is contained in all the Indian reserves in all of Southern Canada. And the Nunavut treaty made the Inuit there the largest private landowners in the world, with title to 350,000 square kilometres. The text of the Yukon treaty is longer than the New Testament. Canadians, it is said, do not want constitutional change, but in the territories, the changes have been enormous, all as the result of bottom-up innovation from aboriginal and territorial government leaders. Yukon aboriginal self-government agreements give First Nations quasi-provincial powers and were the model for settlements with the Nisga'a and others in B.C. and the Northwest Territories. But NWT First Nations have also experimented with regional shared governance arrangements with municipal authorities. As Simon Fraser professor Doug McArthur has written: “There is a new constitutional settlement in the North.” And nobody in the South knows much about it. Wade Davis: Canadians forget how recently European contact convulsed the lives of the Inuit … This, then, is the tragedy and perhaps the inspiration of the Arctic. A people that have endured so much – epidemic disease, the humiliation and violence of the residential schools, the culture of poverty inherent in the welfare system, drug and alcohol exposure leading to suicide rates six times that of Southern Canada – now, on the very eve of their emergence as a culture reborn, politically, socially, and psychologically – find themselves confronted by a force beyond their capacity to resist. The ice is melting, and with it, quite possibly a way of life. For most Canadians, climate change is seen as a technical and scientific challenge, distant from their lives. The Inuit live its reality every day. They are a people of the ice. As hunters, they depend on it for their survival, even as it inspires the very essence of their character and culture. Indeed, it is the very nature of ice, the way it moves, recedes, dissolves and reforms with the seasons, that gives such flexibility to the Inuit heart and spirit. They have no illusions of permanence. There is no time for regret. Despair is an insult to the imagination. Their grocery store is out there on the land. To live, they must kill the things they most love. Blood on ice in the Arctic is not a sign of death but an affirmation of life. Death is the disappearance of the ice. Climate change for the Inuit is not an environmental or political issue, but rather an issue of cultural survival, with profound psychological and indeed spiritual implications. 'SOBER THOUGHTS' Doug Saunders: In recent years, the North has taken on a new political and economic prominence in Canada. Will this create a new era of prosperity and independence for northern communities, or does it bring a risk of exploitation and damage to communities and environments? Michael Byers: Despite the increased media attention, Canada lags far behind other Arctic countries in seizing the opportunities presented by rising resource prices and retreating sea ice. Russia generates more than 20 per cent of its GDP from the Arctic. Norway profits from being the world leader in the high-tech field of Arctic oil and gas. Iceland has turned itself into a global tourist destination. As for Canada, consider this: Despite having the longest coastline of any of the Arctic countries, our most northern port is at Churchill – in Manitoba. Balancing economic development, local governance and environmental protection will never be easy. But serious investments in infrastructure – including a port at Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut – would be a good start. Shelagh Grant: As a historian, the excitement and hyperbole attached to the prospect of extensive mineral and fossil fuel development in the Canadian North reminds me of the promises associated with the building of the CPR and the Yukon Gold Rush. While the potential for new economic development is indeed exciting, second sober thoughts should consider the consequences for the predominately indigenous northern communities. For anyone who has visited an open-pit mine in the North, the ecological consequences are obvious. Although oil and gas developments are surprisingly less detrimental to the environment, the risks of a major oil spill could be catastrophic. Yet far too often, environmental issues gain more publicity than the more subtle social and economic questions. Most northern communities are led to believe that new mining developments will create new job opportunities and profits for local industries. But this has not happened with the Raglan Mine on the Ungava shores of Northern Quebec. Dare I suggest that what Canada needs is a leader who can convince all Canadians that it's in their best interest to make an extraordinary investment in the infrastructure and educational opportunities in the Far North to ensure that the future prosperity of our country. Otherwise, Northern Canada risks becoming an abandoned sand box after the large corporations have extracted all the treasures of any value. 'HUMAN FLAGPOLES' Doug Saunders: “Arctic sovereignty” has become a key catchphrase in media and politics, and many people believe that investments and military expansions are required to maintain or stake Canadian sovereignty. How important is this? John English: A few years ago, I was involved in a publishing project and was told that “Arctic sovereignty” had to be in the title, because it sells best. A casual scan of Canadian book titles quickly confirms the publisher's argument. It does “flare up” suddenly, as when the Manhattan and Polar Sea incidents apparently threatened Canada's Arctic claims, but the debates generate more confusion than clarity about the character of Canada's Arctic presence. Too often, “Arctic sovereignty” becomes the first refuge of political scoundrels who obscure the very real challenges facing Arctic communities, and the 1950s sovereignty flare-up in which Inuit families became “human flagpoles” is an appalling example of abuse. The Arctic Council contains two military superpowers, and Canada cannot hope to compete with them militarily. As long as others have a significant Arctic military presence, we must respond with better ships, planes and ports than we currently have. We also need to invest in our northern communities and assure that the Arctic Council, which was primarily a Canadian creation, remains the effective multilateral forum for Arctic states. Rob Huebert: Many will also contend that these are only diplomatic issues that are already well in hand. The logic that flows from such a view is that there really is not much needed to be spent on defence of Canadian Arctic sovereignty and that the resources would be better spent elsewhere. I would argue that this is not a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the issue. Defending Canadian Arctic sovereignty is not only about defining the borders and international legal status of the Canadian North – though it is often the first step that is necessary. It is really about the control of the region. Thus, I believe that, in order to protect the long-term interests of northerners and southerners, Canada does need the equipment, training, and personnel to ultimately defend and protect and enforce our interests, values and rules. Michael Byers: Canada's sovereignty is uncontested within 99.99 per cent of the territory we claim as our own, with the exception being tiny Hans Island – which Denmark also claims. Our two other Arctic disputes involve the maritime domain. Resolving these disputes is not a question of money or military power. A quarter of a century after the Cold War ended, we live in a deeply integrated, truly global economy. Denmark is part of the European Union, with which Canada recently negotiated a free-trade agreement. Canada is the United States's largest trading partner. And Russia, the newest member of the WTO, has an oil-and-gas-based economy that is heavily dependent on foreign capital, technology and markets. In the circumstances, there is no question of a “fight” over Arctic sovereignty, apart from a fight between lawyers. Although there are good reasons to spend money in the Arctic, sovereignty – legally defined – is not one of them. 'GETTING OFF CHEAP' Doug Saunders: What are the challenges and responsibilities for the future of northern peoples? What do we say to those who believe that Ottawa should not be subsidizing remote communities to the extent that we do? Tony Penikett: As I understand it, the complaint is that Canadians subsidize each Nunavummiut to the tune of something like $32,000 a year. That means each Canadian contributes about $30 a year to support Nunavut. But, as is often said, since the Cold War-era relocations to Ellesmere Island, the Inuit of Nunavut have been the human flagpoles of Canadian sovereignty and Arctic security. The United States bases 25,000 armed-forces personnel in Alaska at a likely cost of about $100 or more a year per American. Nunavummiut suffer the highest food, housing and energy prices in Canada – in other words, extreme food insecurity and seriously overcrowded homes. And since Canada's military presence in the Arctic remains light on the ground, maybe Canada is getting off cheap and our flagpoles deserve more support. Mary Simon: Can we not at least agree that Canadians, along with other northern nations, understand that distance, small populations and cultural diversity are part of our national character and part of what makes us a polar nation? I also want to say that the “remoteness” of Arctic communities is outdated thinking in an age of daily air travel and Internet connectivity. As the late Jose Kusugak once said, Inuit view themselves as “First Canadians, Canadians First,” and we want to be full contributors to Canada. Thoughtful development of Arctic resources will attract investment in Canada, create employment for Canadians, pay royalties to governments and Inuit, and buy goods and services from the provinces. We are trying to accomplish in the North in two generations what Canada has done in other regions in six generations. To the critics, we say this: Canada is a polar nation. Realizing the possibilities of the Arctic region and its people will take more time and necessitates the long view that a country with 150 years of nation-building experience should understand. ******** PANELISTS Mary Simon has served as Canada's first ambassador for circumpolar affairs, as president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and as lead negotiator for the creation of the Arctic Council.

"G2: THE DARK HEART OF SCANDINAVIA: Forget what you've heard about the 'Scandinavian miracle'. Television in Denmark is rubbish, Finnish men like a drink - and Sweden is not always a model of democracy. Why, asks sometime Denmark resident Michael Booth, does everybody think the Nordic region is some sort of utopia on earth?",Norway,"For the past few years the world has been in thrall to all things Nordic (for which purpose we must of course add Iceland and Finland to the Viking nations of Denmark, Norway and Sweden). ""The Sweet Danish Life: Copenhagen: Cool, Creative, Carefree,"" simpered National Geographic; ""The Nordic Countries: The Next Supermodel"", boomed the Economist; ""Copenhagen really is wonderful for so many reasons,"" gushed the Guardian. Whether it is Denmark's happiness, its restaurants, or TV dramas; Sweden's gender equality, crime novels and retail giants; Finland's schools; Norway's oil wealth and weird songs about foxes; or Iceland's bounce-back from the financial abyss, we have an insatiable appetite for positive Nordic news stories. After decades dreaming of life among olive trees and vineyards, these days for some reason, we Brits are now projecting our need for the existence of an earthly paradise northwards. I have contributed to the relentless Tetris shower of print columns on the wonders of Scandinavia myself over the years but now I say: enough! Nu er det nok! Enough with foraging for dinner. Enough with the impractical minimalist interiors. Enough with the envious reports on the abolition of gender-specific pronouns. Enough of the unblinking idolatry of all things knitted, bearded, rye bread-based and licorice-laced. It is time to redress the imbalance, shed a little light Beyond the Wall. Take the Danes, for instance. True, they claim to be the happiest people in the world, but why no mention of the fact they are second only to Iceland when it comes to consuming anti- depressants? And Sweden? If, as a headline in this paper once claimed, it is ""the most successful society the world has ever seen"", why aren't more of you dreaming of ""a little place"" in Umea? Actually, I have lived in Denmark - on and off - for about a decade, because my wife's work is here (and she's Danish). Life here is pretty comfortable, more so for indigenous families than for immigrants or ambitious go-getters (Google ""Jantelov"" for more on this), but as with all the Nordic nations, it remains largely free of armed conflict, extreme poverty, natural disasters and Jeremy Kyle. So let's remove those rose-tinted ski goggles and take a closer look at the objects of our infatuation . . . DENMARK Why do the Danes score so highly on international happiness surveys? Well, they do have high levels of trust and social cohesion, and do very nicely from industrial pork products, but according to the OECD they also work fewer hours per year than most of the rest of the world. As a result, productivity is worryingly sluggish. How can they afford all those expensively foraged meals and hand-knitted woollens? Simple, the Danes also have the highest level of private debt in the world (four times as much as the Italians, to put it into context; enough to warrant a warning from the IMF), while more than half of them admit to using the black market to obtain goods and services. Perhaps the Danes' dirtiest secret is that, according to a 2012 report from the Worldwide Fund for Nature, they have the fourth largest per capita ecological footprint in the world. Even ahead of the US. Those offshore windmills may look impressive as you land at Kastrup, but Denmark is the EU's largest exporter of oil, and it still burns an awful lot of coal. Worth bearing that in mind the next time a Dane wags her finger at your patio heater. I'm afraid I have to set you straight on Danish television too. Their big new drama series, Arvingerne (The Legacy, when it comes to BBC4 later this year) is stunning, but the reality of prime-time Danish TV is day-to-day, wall-to-wall reruns of 15-year-old episodes of Midsomer Murders and documentaries on pig welfare. The Danes of course also have highest taxes in the world (though only the sixth-highest wages - hence the debt, I guess). As a spokesperson I interviewed at the Danish centre-right thinktank Cepos put it, they effectively work until Thursday lunchtime for the state's coffers, and the other day and half for themselves. Presumably the correlative of this is that Denmark has the best public services? According to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment rankings (Pisa), Denmark's schools lag behind even the UK's. Its health service is buckling too. (The other day, I turned up at my local A&E; to be told that I had to make an appointment, which I can't help feeling rather misunderstands the nature of the service.) According to the World Cancer Research Fund, the Danes have the highest cancer rates on the planet. ""But at least the trains run on time!"" I hear you say. No, that was Italy under Mussolini. The Danish national rail company has skirted bankruptcy in recent years, and the trains most assuredly do not run on time. Somehow, though, the government still managed to find pounds 2m to fund a two-year tax-scandal investigation largely concerned, as far as I can make out, with the sexual orientation of the prime minister's husband, Stephen Kinnock. Most seriously of all, economic equality - which many believe is the foundation of societal success - is decreasing. According to a report in Politiken this month, the proportion of people below the poverty line has doubled over the last decade. Denmark is becoming a nation divided, essentially, between the places which have a branch of Sticks'n'Sushi (Copenhagen) and the rest. Denmark's provinces have become a social dumping ground for non-western immigrants, the elderly, the unemployed and the unemployable who live alongside Denmark's 22m intensively farmed pigs, raised 10 to a pen and pumped full of antibiotics (the pigs, that is). Other awkward truths? There is more than a whiff of the police state about the fact that Danish policeman refuse to display ID numbers and can refuse to give their names. The Danes are aggressively jingoistic, waving their red-and-white dannebrog at the slightest provocation. Like the Swedes, they embraced privatisation with great enthusiasm (even the ambulance service is privatised); and can seem spectacularly unsophisticated in their race relations (cartoon depictions of black people with big lips and bones through their noses are not uncommon in the national press). And if you think a move across the North Sea would help you escape the paedophiles, racists, crooks and tax-dodging corporations one reads about in the British media on a daily basis, I'm afraid I must disavow you of that too. Got plenty of them. Plus side? No one talks about cricket. NORWAY The dignity and resolve of the Norwegian people in the wake of the attacks by Anders Behring Breivik in July 2011 was deeply impressive, but in September the rightwing, anti-Islamist Progress party - of which Breivik had been an active member for many years - won 16.3% of the vote in the general election, enough to elevate it into coalition government for the first time in its history. There remains a disturbing Islamophobic sub-subculture in Norway. Ask the Danes, and they will tell you that the Norwegians are the most insular and xenophobic of all the Scandinavians, and it is true that since they came into a bit of money in the 1970s the Norwegians have become increasingly Scrooge-like, hoarding their gold, fearful of outsiders. Though 2013 saw a record number of asylum applications to Norway, it granted asylum to fewer than half of them (around 5,000 people), a third of the number that less wealthy Sweden admits (Sweden accepted over 9,000 from Syria alone). In his book Petromania, journalist Simon Saetre warns that the powerful oil lobby is ""isolating us and making the country asocial"". According to him, his countrymen have been corrupted by their oil money, are working less, retiring earlier, and calling in sick more frequently. And while previous governments have controlled the spending of oil revenues, the new bunch are threatening a splurge which many warn could lead to full-blown Dutch disease. Like the dealer who never touches his own supply, those dirty frackers the Norwegians boast of using only renewable energy sources, all the while amassing the world's largest sovereign wealth fund selling fossil fuels to the rest of us. As Norwegian anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen put it to me when I visited his office in Oslo University: ""We've always been used to thinking of ourselves as part of the solution, and with the oil we suddenly became part of the problem. Most people are really in denial."" ICELAND We need not detain ourselves here too long. Only 320,000 - it would appear rather greedy and irresponsible - people cling to this breathtaking, yet borderline uninhabitable rock in the North Atlantic. Further attention will only encourage them. FINLAND I am very fond of the Finns, a most pragmatic, redoubtable people with a Sahara-dry sense of humour. But would I want to live in Finland? In summer, you'll be plagued by mosquitos, in winter, you'll freeze - that's assuming no one shoots you, or you don't shoot yourself. Finland ranks third in global gun ownership behind only America and Yemen; has the highest murder rate in western Europe, double that of the UK; and by far the highest suicide rate in the Nordic countries. The Finns are epic Friday-night bingers and alcohol is now the leading cause of death for Finnish men. ""At some point in the evening around 11.30pm, people start behaving aggressively, throwing punches, wrestling,"" Heikki Aittokoski, foreign editor of Helsingin Sanomat, told me. ""The next day, people laugh about it. In the US, they'd have an intervention."" With its tarnished crown jewel, Nokia, devoured by Microsoft, Finland's hitherto robust economy is more dependent than ever on selling paper - mostly I was told, to Russian porn barons. Luckily, judging by a recent journey I took with my eldest son the length of the country by train, the place appears to be 99% trees. The view was a bit samey. The nation once dubbed ""the west's reigning educational superpower"" (the Atlantic) has slipped in the latest Pisa rankings. This follows some unfortunate incidents involving Finnish students - the burning of Porvoo cathedral by an 18-year-old in 2006; the Jokela shootings (another disgruntled 18-year-old) in 2007, and the shooting of 10 more students by a peer in 2008 - which led some to speculate whether Finnish schools were quite as wonderful as their reputation would have us believe. If you do decide to move there, don't expect scintillating conversation. Finland's is a reactive, listening culture, burdened by taboos too many to mention (civil war, second world war and cold war-related, mostly). They're not big on chat. Look up the word ""reticent"" in the dictionary and you won't find a picture of an awkward Finn standing in a corner looking at his shoelaces, but you should. ""We would always prefer to be alone,"" a Finnish woman once admitted to me. She worked for the tourist board. SWEDEN Anything I say about the Swedes will pale in comparison to their own excoriating self-image. A few years ago, the Swedish Institute of Public Opinion Research asked young Swedes to describe their compatriots. The top eight adjectives they chose were: envious, stiff, industrious, nature loving, quiet, honest, dishonest, xenophobic. I met with Ake Daun, Sweden's most venerable ethnologist. ""Swedes seem not to 'feel as strongly' as certain other people"", Daun writes in his excellent book, Swedish Mentality. ""Swedish women try to moan as little as possible during childbirth and they often ask, when it is all over, whether they screamed very much. They are very pleased to be told they did not."" Apparently, crying at funerals is frowned upon and ""remembered long afterwards"". The Swedes are, he says, ""highly adept at insulating themselves from each other"". They will do anything to avoid sharing a lift with a stranger, as I found out during a day-long experiment behaving as un-Swedishly as possible in Stockholm. Effectively a one-party state - albeit supported by a couple of shadowy industrialist families - for much of the 20th century, ""neutral"" Sweden (one of the world largest arms exporters) continues to thrive economically thanks to its distinctive brand of totalitarian modernism, which curbs freedoms, suppresses dissent in the name of consensus, and seems hell-bent on severing the bonds between wife and husband, children and parents, and elderly on their children. Think of it as the China of the north. Youth unemployment is higher than the UK's and higher than the EU average; integration is an ongoing challenge; and as with Norway and Denmark, the Swedish right is on the rise. A spokesman for the Sweden Democrats (currently at an all-time high of close to 10% in the polls) insisted to me that immigrants were ""more prone to violence"". I pointed out that Sweden was one of the most bloodthirsty nations on earth for much of the last millennium. I was told we'd run out of time. Ask the Finns and they will tell you that Swedish ultra-feminism has emasculated their men, but they will struggle to drown their sorrows. Their state-run alcohol monopoly stores, the dreaded Systembolaget, were described by Susan Sontag as ""part funeral parlour, part back-room abortionist"". The myriad successes of the Nordic countries are no miracle, they were born of a combination of Lutheran modesty, peasant parsimony, geographical determinism and ruthless pragmatism (""The Russians are attacking? Join the Nazis! The Nazis are losing? Join the Allies!""). These societies function well for those who conform to the collective median, but they aren't much fun for tall poppies. Schools reign in higher achievers for the sake of the less gifted; ""elite"" is a dirty word; displays of success, ambition or wealth are frowned upon. If you can cope with this, and the cost, and the cold (both metaphorical and inter-personal), then by all means join me in my adopted hyggelige (home). I've rustled up a sorrel salad and there's some expensive, weak beer in the fridge. Pull up an Egg. I hear Taggart's on again!

"NORDIC CULTURE: The blond leading the blond: This enjoyable survey of all things Nordic finds that our friends in the north are as flawed as we are, writes Oslo-born Mariella Frostrup: The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle Michael Booth Jonathan Cape pounds 14.99, pp416",Norway,"It's a source of some surprise that despite our proximity to the richest, the most socially advanced and the happiest societies on earth (Norway, Sweden and Denmark respectively), the UK population hasn't chosen to emigrate en masse. Instead, our gaze remains resolutely focused southwards, as constant as this year's rain, whether for sun or snow, diet or quality of life, while our northerly neighbours merit barely a glance. Between them they boast the Nobel prize and Ikea, H&M; and enough crude oil to rival Saudi Arabia, the best education system, the best health service and unrivalled gender equality, but they seldom make headlines. On his odyssey among the ""Almost Nearly Perfect People"", British journalist Michael Booth has managed to uncover a few facts of truly tabloid vintage: neutral Sweden is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world, 5% of Danish men have had sex with animals, and 54% of Icelanders believe in elves. None of the latter is likely to increase tourism to the far north, but as the author points out, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark do little to promote themselves. One theory about my fellow Scandinavians' reticence to holler about their virtues is that there'd be a stampede if they advertised. It's the only plausible explanation not covered in Michael Booth's comprehensive and occasionally downright hilarious explanation of the Nordic miracle, as imagined by everyone living outside of this social democratic hotspot. Spurred by yet another survey describing his wife's fellow Danes as the happiest people on earth, Booth, a Copenhagen resident, elected to investigate what really makes the Scandinavians tick. Dedicating a section to each of the five countries he maintains make up the Nordic bloc, he takes us as deep into the Scandinavian psyche as we're ever likely to want to go; from the Danish addiction to the sterile comforts of hyggelig, or ""cosy times"", to Norwegian isolationism, the Finns' much vaunted sisu, or machismo, the Swedes' obsessive conformity and the Icelandic devil-may-care approach to banking. Of my birthplace Booth comments, ""When a man is bored of Oslo. . . he's probably been there three days"", going on to reveal that the Norwegians' biggest hit TV show of recent years isn't from the Nordic noir stable but a seven-hour documentary of a train's real-life progress from Bergen to Oslo with a camera strapped to the front of it! Booth's wry eye zooms in on many such characteristics and peccadillos of our closest cousins. By the time he gets to Sweden, commonly regarded as the most perfect nation on earth, and chooses to provoke the uber-conformist population (his conclusion not mine) by committing acts of social terrorism like eating crisps and slurping coke in the Swedish National museum or abandoning all common sense and crossing streets while the lights are still red, I was laughing out loud. His companionable, lightly mocking tone remains in place when he veers to the darker extremities, exploring, among much else, the Finnish addiction to anti-psychotic drugs, the Norwegian antisocial tendencies and weird penchant for 19th-century national costume, the Icelandic revenge against the Danes via a suicidal corporate spending spree, and Sweden's questionable freedom of speech credentials when it comes to the far right. This amble through Scandiland may be light on any profound conclusion, but it's a lively and endearing portrait of our friends in the north, venerated globally for their perfectly balanced societies but, it turns out, as flawed as the rest of us - or at least only almost perfect.

US to appoint Arctic envoy,Norway,"The United States announced Friday it would appoint a special envoy to the Arctic, a region increasingly coveted by several countries for its oil and other raw materials. Secretary of State John Kerry pointed to the huge resources that lie in the northernmost polar region as he unveiled plans to name a senior ""official of stature"" to advance American interests as Washington prepares to chair the eight-country Arctic Council next year. ""The Arctic region is the last global frontier and a region with enormous and growing geostrategic, economic, climate, environment and national security implications for the United States and the world,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""The great challenges of the Arctic matter enormously to the United States, and they hit especially close to home for Alaska."" Six of the eight Arctic nations -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States -- currently have ambassador-level diplomats representing them before the Arctic council. Parts of Alaska and other US territories lie in the Arctic. ""President (Barack) Obama and I are committed to elevating our attention and effort to keep up with the opportunities and consequences presented by the Arctic's rapid transformation - a very rare convergence of almost every national priority in the most rapidly - changing region on the face of the Earth,"" Kerry said. ""Going forward, I look forward to continuing to work closely with Alaska's Congressional delegation to strengthen America's engagement in Arctic issues."" Alaska Senator Mark Begich, who has pushed legislation for a US envoy to the region since 2008, called Kerry's decision an ""important step in the right direction."" ""The bottom line is that the changes we see in the Arctic warrant a higher level of involvement from the US and this position will allow us to better exercise leadership and vision in Arctic policy moving forward,"" the Democratic lawmaker added. The Arctic has seen growing international interest in recent years, as global warming causes the Arctic ice cap to melt and opens new navigation routes that facilitate the use of previously inaccessible raw materials. Canada currently holds the rotating, two-year presidency of the Arctic Council, which promotes cooperation on issues such as environmental protection, oil and gas mining, shipping, fishing and tourism. In early January, Canada began construction on the first route linking the Arctic Ocean to the North American continent, which should speed up oil and gas exploration in the desert region. The white desert is believed to hold about 22 percent of the world's unexplored conventional hydrocarbon resources. nr/oh/rcw"
"HANDS OFF, YOU ARGIES! THESE'LL SOON BE THE RICHEST SLANDS ON EARTH",Norway,"New oil finds off the Falklands could earn the islanders billions. And, as SIMON HEFFER found, they're more than ready for a fight if their old enemy gets any ideas BY SIMON HEFFER in port stanley FLYING low in a light aircraft over East Falkland, you can still see the shell holes and craters pock-marking the landscape around Mount Tumbledown, scene of some of the most brutal fighting in the war of 1982. The battle scars may have become a part of the landscape, but for many islanders the conflict remains as real as though it were yesterday. 'My husband and I often say we don't know what we would talk about if it wasn't for the Argentinians,' says Fiona Didlick, who with her husband Keith runs a guesthouse at Darwin, just down the road from Goose Green. The Didlicks came to the islands from Britain just after the war — the civilian population has almost doubled to around 3,000 in the past three decades — but, like most other residents, they find themselves occasionally mulling over what their bellicose neighbour might, or might not, be planning for them. Memories among those who endured the conflict remain vivid. Lisa Watson, the editor of the Falklands' newspaper Penguin News, was an 11-year-old girl when enemy soldiers burst into her family home. 'We were all ordered to stand up facing the wall with our hands above our heads. I refused to do so and sat on the sofa sucking my thumb. They didn't know what to do, so they left me alone,' she says. Another group of farmers on Pebble Island, off East Falkland, were kept under house arrest for a month. 'We were lucky,' says Ian Hansen, who was 20 at the time and is now a member of the islands' legislative assembly. 'The soldiers were teenage conscripts, scared of their officers and scared of us. 'We were allowed to eat our own supplies that were in the community stores, but the conscripts would come and beg us for food. 'They were relieved to be taken prisoner when we were liberated. The officers had commandeered a house and when we went in we found they had enough supplies to last a year — but they weren't sharing it with their men.' The haunting experience of having looked enemy troops defiantly in the eye means most islanders are passionate about the liberty won through the sacrifice of 255 British lives. As Keith Didlick says: 'Some of the birdwatchers who come to visit on cruise ships complain about the noise from low-flying RAF jets. But I just tell them it's the sound of freedom.' Almost a year ago, 99.8 per cent of Falklanders — all but three of those who voted in a referendum — chose to remain British. The Union flag flies ubiquitously in Stanley, a windswept town of whitewashed clapboarded houses with bright red or green corrugated iron roofs. And not just outside government buildings, but on private homes, in car windows, shops and on souvenirs. There are more red phone boxes in the town than in most British ones. A red pillar box bears the cipher of George VI, and one of the main residential streets is named Thatcher Drive. The referendum was the answer to a campaign of verbal aggression by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the volatile Argentinian president. Last week, the Mail reported how British cruise ships docking in Buenos Aires have been threatened with being boarded by force if they are flying the Red Ensign (flown by all British non-military ships). This was described by Falklands veteran Admiral Lord West, who was a passenger on one such ship, as 'atrocious' and 'an insult to the nation'. For all that, in the Falklands at least Kirchner is a national laughing stock. The locals always refer to her just as 'Cristina', rather as adults would an exasperating, silly and tiresome child. 'Cristina's great political legacy is that she has finally created our sense of national identity,' one Falklands politician tells me. 'We know exactly who we are now, and what we want to be.' The British government has very much got the message. I was in the islands last week with Hugo Swire, the Foreign Office minister responsible for them, and he was unequivocal in his support for continued British rule. 'We are 100 per cent behind the islands,' he told me. 'We believe the referendum settled the issue of what the islanders want once and for all. And we very much regret Argentina's continuing bullying and intimidation.' Wherever Mr Swire went he was told by islanders how deeply grateful they are for Britain's backing — but he also discovered that life on the islands may, in the next decade or so, change just as radically as if a foreign invasion had taken place. Two oil companies, Noble (which is American) and the British firm Premier, are exploring the waters off the north and south coasts of the islands. It seems certain that 350 million barrels worth of oil are below the sea bed to the north — and it is believed that at least ten times as much could be found to the south. All that remains to be settled is whether the costs of extracting the black gold would be economic —especially now that global oil prices are falling. But most Falklanders, led by the outgoing governor, Nigel Haywood, believe the long-term demand for oil is sure to lead to the Falklands' deposits being developed. One Premier executive told me that when the oil starts coming ashore, 'the Falklands will, per capita, be the richest country on earth'. Many ordinary Falklanders are in two minds about what it means for them. The older generation prize their way of life and see it being changed for the worse if a massive oil industry — with all the support services that entails — suddenly arrives on their doorsteps. The economy relies on fisheries, sheep farming and tourism, and there are said to be more Land Rovers on the islands than people. Younger Falklanders, though, have already seen great social and economic change in their lifetimes, and know the only way to secure freedom is to continue to embrace the modern world. 'My mum and my gran are against it,' one young special needs teacher told me on the Port Stanley waterfront. 'But I accept it's got to happen, and it's for the best.' The simple truth is that there are not enough people on the islands, even with the increased population, to service such an explosion in industrial activity— many islanders already have more than one job and there is full employment. So an oil boom would mean considerable immigration, and extensive housing development, both of which would radically change the Falklanders' way of life. It would also mean significant wealth, so much so that the islands' financial secretary, Nicola Granger, has been to Norway to discuss that country's experience of setting up a sovereign wealth fund — a state-owned fund that would invest all this extra money. The flood of cash could secure the islands' future for generations. It would allow islanders to live off the earnings of their capital and to build a new hospital, schools, a decent road system and possibly even a bridge linking East and West Falkland over the Falklands Sound. Hugo Swire encourages the notion. 'If this money comes in, then, of course, there are infrastructure projects that the island badly needs,' he says. Inevitably, such a windfall would also make the islands even more attractive to Argentina. With the Falkland Islands government levying a 26 per cent corporation tax on profits and planning a 9 per cent royalty on each barrel, the wealth would run into billions. Meanwhile, Argentina is on the verge of bankruptcy. Once, such a crisis would have given the islanders sleepless nights — especially as it was to provide a distraction from domestic troubles that Argentina's fascist dictator, General Galtieri, invaded 32 years ago. But as senior personnel at Mount Pleasant (the Falklands' extensive military base) were at pains to tell me, for Mrs Kirchner even to attempt an invasion would require a miracle. Our defence cuts have prompted retired generals in Britain to question publicly whether we could hope to re-take the islands as Margaret Thatcher's task force did. Their successors at the sharp end at Mount Pleasant say it would never come to that, because there is, in their view, no hope of an invasion succeeding.The Argentinian air force is based on the same aircraft that lost the last war. They do not have the range to attack the islands, because Argentina no longer has an aircraft carrier or airborne refuelling capability. The four state-of-the-art Typhoons at Mount Pleasant would make mincemeat of them. Thanks to cuts, Argentina's navy has no amphibious capability, so it could not put soldiers ashore in the way it did in 1982. Such ships as it has are obsolete: a picture of a troopship sinking last year while in harbour in Argentina because it had simply rotted away greatly amused Falklanders. If its fleet started to move south from ports in Argentina, Britain could reinforce the islands via Ascension Island in the Atlantic (fighter planes or troop planes refuelling there could get to the Falkland Islands within a day), and — crucially — using the main runway at Mount Pleasant (which did not exist in 1982) before any ships could arrive at the islands. 'The best Argentina could hope for is a landing by special forces,' a senior officer told me. 'But even then, they have got to get here undetected — and whether by sea or air, our radar would pick them up the moment they set out.' This week I saw for myself the reassuring array of firepower the Army could bring to bear to repel and attack. The Mount Pleasant complex is the main military base and the civil airport, covering several thousand acres 35 miles south-west of Stanley. It is home to around 1,000 military personnel from all services, mainly the Army, and 1,000 support staff. The main strike weapons against an aggressor are the fearsome Typhoon fighter bombers. There is also a Rapier missile battery and other permanently staffed anti-aircraft emplacements around the islands. HMS Clyde — which boasts a helicopter deck, troop accommodation, a 30mm gun and surveillance radar — patrols the waters along with two smaller vessels. Though at present Britain doesn't have an aircraft carrier capable of carrying fighters, which means a task force couldn't be sent in the way it was in 1982, the runway at Stanley means planeloads of troops can be flown into the islands from RAF Brize Norton in 18 hours. Crucially, more fighter jets could also be scrambled from Britain in a matter of hours. All this provides a level of deterrence the islanders deem to be more than sufficient. The development of a serious oil industry would also make an enormous difference. Once the U.S. has a significant commercial interest in the Falklands staying British, the superpower's historic ambivalence towards the sovereignty of the islands would end. For now, Argentina continues with its hectoring. Neighbouring countries in South America are warned that if they seek to invest in the Falklands and share in the likely economic boom they will be cut off by Argentina. For her part, Mrs Kirchner called Hugo Swire 'a high-handed colonialist' for remarks he made in defence of the islanders' right to self-determination. But her propaganda can't mask the reality. Many Argentinian tourists, including veterans of the war, come to the islands. 'They are shocked by what they find,' a resident of Goose Green — whose entire community was locked in its village hall for four weeks during May 1982 — tells me. 'They have been told we are second-class citizens under the British jackboot, oppressed and with no rights or decent living standards, and that we speak Spanish. When they get here they are astonished to find we are a happy, prosperous little country and fiercely pro-British.' It is also a little country that may soon change out of all recognition, and its old way of life with it. But whatever happens in economic terms, that red postbox and all those Union flags will continue to stand proudly in this very British outpost.

Ecuador's development dilemma: Will oil win out?,Norway,"Standing before the United Nations General Assembly in 2007, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa offered the international community a way to make a significant impact on climate change: Donate $3.6 billion to the economy of Ecuador by 2019, and the country would refrain from drilling for oil in its Yasuni National Park, one of the most biologically diverse tracts of Amazon rainforest. The initiative would prevent the total release of about 400 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere - the equivalent of France's output in one year. The international community was not quick to seize the opportunity, which was embraced by some, and likened to extortion by others. By August 2013, halfway to the 12-year deadline, the UN- administered fund had collected just $13 million - less than 1 percent of the goal. President Correa scrapped the initiative and announced that the state-run oil company Petroamazonas would begin developing oil fields in the Yasuni. The decision drew criticism from environmentalists around the world, who had celebrated Correa's original initiative and even coined the term ""Yasunization"" to describe similar preservation movements in other oil-rich countries like Nigeria and Norway. In Ecuador, his move has drawn the ire of environmental and indigenous rights groups and sparked a debate over an otherwise extremely popular administration. One organization, Yasunidos, is trying to collect 600,000 signatures by April to force a national referendum on whether to allow drilling. But in a country where nearly one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, the dilemma is clear. The Yasuni-ITT block, named for the Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini oil fields, holds about 20 percent of Ecuador's known reserves. Correa says Ecuador now stands to earn $18 billion ($11 billion more than initial estimates) by drilling. Calling it one of the most difficult decisions of his administration, he said he had done all he could. The international community failed to take him up on his deal and his country - particularly the Amazon region, where the poverty rate is almost double the national level and unemployment and malnutrition are high - needs the money to fight poverty and illness. 'Ecuador ama la vida'Oil development in Ecuador has been a contentious subject in recent years. American oil company Chevron is the object of national contempt because of lasting contamination from drilling by Texaco here during the 1960s, 70s, and 80s (Chevron bought Texaco in 2000). In 2011, Chevron was slapped with a record $18 billion fine for environmental and social harms caused by development in Lago Agrio, just northwest of Yasuni. Correa vehemently supports the plaintiffs in the Chevron case and promotes the eco-friendly national slogan ""Ecuador ama la vida"" - ""Ecuador loves life."" New municipal signs encouraging citizens to protect their country's land, wildlife, and fresh waters dot the highways here. Correa insists that today's technology allows oil drilling to be less destructive than before, and has repeatedly said that only 1 percent of Yasuni's land will be affected. But a 2009 study by the Wildlife Conservation Society shows that infrastructure built to transport oil through the Yasuni from other areas has already had an affect on the ecosystem and the indigenous communities living there. Matt Finer, a research specialist at the Amazon Conservation Association who investigates how oil and gas development affect the rainforest, says that ""the development plans we have seen for ITT indicate that Ecuador is planning to drill deep into what is now one of the most remote and intact sections"" of the Yasuni. According to Mr. Finer, new oil roads ""have the potential to truly devastate the park."" At the center of the debateThe Yasuni's indigenous peoples, who inhabited the land for centuries before missionaries, oilmen, and ecotourists started to make their way in, are not united in the debate over their ancestral land's resources. A small number of ""uncontacted peoples"" live in voluntary isolation from the outside world, while other communities work with the oil companies and rainforest tourists. Many communities have effectively negotiated with oil companies through the years for benefits and compensation, says Veronica Davidov, an anthropology professor at New Jersey's Monmouth University, who has done extensive research on ecotourism and oil extraction in the Ecuadorean Amazon. Ironically, the compensation from oil companies has even helped support some ecotourism projects here. Dr. Davidov says the indigenous communities she has interviewed in the area were cynical about Correa's initiative from the beginning. Many ""assumed that Correa would eventually drill anyway.... There is a lot of skepticism among the indigenous communities about how green or environmentally committed he actually is."" This week, British newspaper The Guardian published a document it obtained from talks between China and Ecuador in 2009, which appeared to show that Correa's government was considering making a deal with China to drill for oil in the Yasuni-ITT block during the time the area was ostensibly protected by the initiative. The Ecuadorean government responded swiftly to the report, and the document was removed from The Guardian's website within a day. Ecuador's coordinating minister of economic policy, Patricio Rivera Yanez, stated in a letter to The Guardian that the document had been manipulated; the proposal to include the ITT block in negotiations was made by China and was ""never an object of negotiation on Ecuador's part."" 'A false dilemma?'Correa's government enjoys widespread support in Ecuador. According to a 2013 survey by Chilean NGO Latinobarometro, 73 percent of Ecuadoreans approve of Correa's government and 77 percent feel the country is progressing. Correa says that environmental activists are presenting a ""false dilemma."" ""'Yasuni or oil': this is not true.... I will never allow the Yasuni to disappear,"" Correa said in the speech last August announcing the cancellation of the preservation initiative. Joan Martinez Alier, an economist from the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a founding member of the International Society for Ecological Economics, says he wasn't surprised to hear Correa reverse the initiative. Correa's bottom line is to develop the economy, Mr. Alier says - whatever the consequences are for the Yasuni. ""Correa is changing the image of Ecuador by sacrificing the Yasuni ITT and with other decisions favorable to large scale open cast mining,"" says Alier. ""President Correa is an economist, he is not an environmentalist."" Ecuador's President Correa is resisting calls to reconsider a scrapped initiative to leave Amazon crude oil untouched."

Temperatures in July and August can reach 25–30C, while humidity remains low. 200 years May 17 is Norway's National Day. Almost every settlement will hold a celebration this year to mark 200 years since the constitution was signed. Despite being one of the largest oil and gas exporters, Norway generates 98.5 per cent of its electricity by hydropower, more than any other country. 60,000 The length of Norway's coastline can be stated as anything from 15,000 miles to 60,000 miles, depending on whether you include all the islands. Norway has 2,600 miles of railways, including more than 700 tunnels and 3,000 bridges. Many routes offer fine views of mountains and lakes. Haugesund is the town of festivals, from jazz and movies to The World's Longest Herring Table, a 400–yard table serving ""free herring in all variants"". 2,837ft According to the World Waterfall Database, NORWAY has all 10 of Europe's highest falls. Top dog is the 2,837ft Vinnufossen near the head of Sunndalsfjord. Half of Norway's 18 National Tourist Routes, are in Fjord N O R W AY. Viewpoints and stairways to natural wonders have been created along the routes. 1904 Ålesund owes its Art Nouveau architecture to Kaiser Wilhelm II, who sponsored the rebuilding of his favourite resort after the huge fire in 1904. The Jostedal Glacier is the largest in continental Europe: it is 37 miles long, up to 2,000ft thick and covers an area of 188 square miles. Unesco Two of N O R W AY's most spectacular fjords, Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord, are Unesco World Heritage sites. The latter is just 820ft wide at its narrowest. Tiny Fjærland, on Fjærlandfjord, is N O R W AY's answer to Hay–on–Wye: its wooden warehouses and cowsheds are turned into second–hand bookshops. Many of the old merchants' buildings of Bryggen, Bergen's famous wharf with its picture–perfect wooden houses, now house boutiques and cafés. Island–hop along the coast or travel deep into the Sognefjord or Hardangerfjord on modern express boats – you can take a bicycle on board too. Bergen is famed for its seafood and at the popular Fish Market you can sample local delicacies including raw oysters and freshly boiled shrimps. The Hardanger district is N O R W AY's orchard and on the fruit and cider route in Ulvik you can visit three fruit farms to taste a variety of fresh produce. The train on the Flåm Railway usually stops at the Kjosfossen waterfall to allow people to witness the song and dance of a forest lady who mysteriously appears. 127 miles The 127–milesognefjord is Europe's longest and deepest. Today it wows tourists but for more than 1,000 years it was a major trade route. One of the fjord. Tours – ""Sognefjord in a nutshell"" – takes you from Bergen and combines a boat trip on Nærøyfjord with a journey on the Flåm Railway. 1936 Hurtigruten began daily departures from Bergen to Kirkenes in 1936. The company now sails every day except Christmas Day, calling at 34 ports. In spring and summer, little Runde Island is home to more than half a million seabirds of at least 80 species, including puffins, kittiwakes and razorbills. On the southbound voyage, ships visit the same ports but at different times of day, so those you passed in the night you now see in daylight . 13 billion Saltstraumen has the world's most powerful tidal current, as 13 billion cubic feet of water are forced in and out through a passage 500ft wide and 100ft deep. The Hurtigruten steamer Finnmarken, built in 1956 and retired in 2002, is a prime attraction at the Coastal Express Museum at Stokmarknes. At the Lofotr Viking Museum, the largest Viking building ever found has been recreated. The original chieftain's house was inhabited from AD 500 to 900. Sustainable design Hurtigruten's MS Midnatsol combines a modern design with a strong environmental profile, with Norwegian materials used extensively throughout its interior. At Oslo's Kon–Tiki Museum, you can see the original balsawood raft on which Thor Heyerdahl and his crew bravely crossed the Pacific in 1947. Oslo is one of Europe's greenest capitals. It is more than 50 per cent forest, has 343 lakes and nowhere is more than 15 minutes from wild nature. Built in 1856, Skibladner is the world's oldest paddle–steamer in regular service. She still plies Lake Mjøsa between Lillehammer and Eidsvoll. Well–known national and international artists come to Trondheim's St Olav Festival in July and August – it is Norway's biggest religious and cultural event. 18th century Stiftsgården royal palace in Trondheim dates back to the late 18th century. With 140 rooms, it's one of the largest wooden buildings in Europe. The ancient 400–mile Pilgrim's Route from Oslo to Saint Olav's shrine in Trondheim was reopened in 1997 and is a peaceful way to experience the landscape."
Norwegian Prince Visits City,Norway,"THE ST. PETERSBURG TIMES His Royal Highness Crown Prince Haakon of Norway spent three days in Russia from Feb. 25 to 27 as part of a state visit, with activities aimed at the promotion of Norwegian industrial initiatives in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Oblast. Business relations between Russia and Norway date back to the Viking Age. The barter of fish from Norway and grain from the north of Russia, known as the Pomor trade, was important for people in the region from the mid-18th century until the early 20th century. Today, the two nations continue to cooperate closely on the sustainable management of fish populations in the Barents Sea. ""The Barents Sea is home to the world's largest cod stock,"" said Crown Prince Haakon at a Norwegian-Russian business seminar held during his visit. ""Russia is currently Norway's most important seafood market and more than four million meals of Norwegian seafood are enjoyed in Russia every single day."" A wide range of issues were discussed at the meeting, which took place at the Corinthia Hotel St. Petersburg, including technological developments in the oil, gas and maritime sectors, and the development of closer ties within the tourism and seafood industries. ""An increasing number of Norwegian companies see the potential and are, as a result, investing in Russia,"" said the Prince. ""Around 100 Norwegian companies are now well established in Russia. Several Russian companies, such as LUKoil and Rosneft, have established themselves in Norway as well. We hope to see many more in the years to come."" Tourism is an important sector for cross-border interaction. Norway is an increasingly popular holiday destination for Russians. In 2013, 200,000 Russians visited the country, while 40,000 Norwegian tourists vacation in St. Petersburg annually. On Feb. 26, the Crown Prince officially opened a new production facility for the Norwegian company Jo- tun outside St. Petersburg. Jotun is a supplier of paint to the Russian shipbuilding industry and many of St. Petersburg's most famous bridges are covered with its coatings. As part of the formal opening ceremony, the Crown Prince, alongside Norwegian and Russian officials, pressed a button on a paint palette to launch production. Test production is now underway at the new facility, with commercial production scheduled for later this year. Jotun has invested 1.7 billion rubles ($47.2 million), in the project. The manufacturer can produce 12 million liters of paint and 3,600 tons of powder coatings a year. Education was addressed with a meeting between students at Baltic State Technical University and Crown Prince Haakon for a discussion of cooperation between the Norwegian University of Nordland and the Petersburg school. Currently 1,600 Russians study in Norway. Crown Prince Haakon also visited FMC Technologies, a Norwegian company which is a leading global supplier of solutions for subsea oil and gas production. The company established the FMC Polytechnic Center in association with the St. Petersburg State Poly- technical University. The Prince's visit also included an opening ceremony at the new offices of the Consulate General of Norway in St. Petersburg, which began operations in 2013, and a meeting with St. Petersburg Governor Georgy Poltavchenko."
"Cruise regulations put Svalbard off-limits; Switch to lighter, more expensive fuel or change your itineraries, authorities in Norway tell cruise firms",Norway,"Parts of Norway's remote Svalbard archipelago will be off limits to the majority of cruise passengers from next January. Larger cruise lines will be unable to visit the pristine wilderness area from 2015 when a heavy fuel oil ban (HFO) comes into effect. The ban is similar to that which came into effect in Antractica in 2011, forcing several cruise lines to cancel itineraries there. The HFO ban has existed in most protected areas of Svalbard since 2007 and 2010. Cruise lines were given five years to adapt to the lighter marine diesel fuel DMA, and offered a two-year reprieve on sailings to Ny-Alesund and Magdalena Bay. But heavy oil remains the dominant fuel and the Ny-Alesund and Magdalena exception will be terminated on January 1, prohibiting ships from sailing within the borders of the national parks on the east and west coast of the archipelago. Princess Cruise[http://www.princess.com] s, Holland America Line[http://www.hollandamerica.com], Silversea[http://www.siversea.com], MSC Cruises[http://msccruises.co.uk], Seabourn[http://www.seabourn.com], Regent Seven Seas[http://www.rssc.com], Fred Olsen[http://www.fredolsencruises.com] and Saga [http://www.saga.co.uk/cruises] all offer itineraries that feature Svalbard. Future visits to the area will consist mainly of smaller expedition vessels that use small ribbed inflatables to ferry passengers close to glaciers and wildlife and whose vessels already comply with the new regulation. These include MS Fram, operated by Hurtigruten[http://www.hurtigruten.co.uk] . Saga will make what it is calling ""historic"" final ports of call at the remote outpost of Ny-Alesund and glacier-choked Magdalena Bay during its Arctic Explorer cruise, which departs from Dover in June. On the ship's last voyage more than 400 mammals were seen in Magdalena Bay, including blue and humpback whales. Saga says that weather permitting crew will set up ""the world's most northerly bar"" using a temporary landing pontoon for guests who want to take a tender to the fjord's isloated beach. Beverly Glick, a cruise writer for the Daily Telegraph who visited Magdalena Bay on Saga Pearl II last year said she had mixed feelings about the news that cruise passengers will no longer be able to visit the prisitine spot. “I consider myself exceptionally fortunate to have experienced this Arctic wilderness. But this is not our domain: it belongs to the polar bear, the Arctic fox and the Arctic tern. This was brought home to me last year when I visited Magdalena Bay on Saga Pearl II. Armed rangers had been tracking a female polar bear all morning. She decided to approach the beach as the final group of passengers made their way back to the landing stage. If she had come any closer the rangers would have shot to kill. “I also witnessed a bald-headed man being dive-bombed by a territorial Arctic tern. We were intruders - that much was clear."" In an open letter to cruise lines Svalbard Tourism has outlined plans to facilitate longer stays in Longyearbyen (the largest settlement and administrative centre of Svalbard) and Isfjorden (the Ice Fjord). These include guided glacier walks, hiking and boat trips more flexible opening times at shops, museums and galleries to encourage overnight stays. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/travel-guides-by-telegraph/id793779955?ls=1&mt;=8[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/travel-guides-by-telegraph/id793779955?ls=1&mt;=8] Follow @TelegraphCruise[https://twitter.com/telegraphcruise]"
Tourists push the boat out as global warming opens Arctic,Norway,"The warming of the Arctic will trigger a boom in tourism, with many more cruise lines including trips to the region in their schedules, according to the UN's climate science advisory body. Killer whales and gray whales will benefit from the melting of the Arctic ice, increasing opportunities for whalewatching trips. The Northern Sea Route above Siberia will be open for up to 125 days a year by 2050 rather than the 50 at present, allowing commercial shipping to take a short cut between Asia and Europe. A leaked draft of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lists benefits from the shrinking ice cap along with the well-known risks, such as the threat to polar bears and loss of Inuit hunting traditions. It says Arctic sea ice has been declining at 13 per cent per decade and the region has been warming since the 1980s at twice the global rate. ""Loss of sea ice may open up waterways and opportunities for increased cruise traffic and add to an already rapid increase in cruise tourism,"" says the report, the final version of which is being agreed in Yokohama, in Japan, this week and will be published on Monday. ""Climate change has increased the prevalence of cruise tourism throughout Greenland, Norway, Alaska and Canada because of decreasing sea ice."" The growing number of ice-free months on the Northern Sea Route, also known as the Northeast Passage, will encourage shipping companies to re-route vessels that normally travel between Europe and Asia via the Suez Canal. The voyage from Shanghai to Rotterdam via the Arctic route, first traversed in 1879 by a Swedish explorer, Baron Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, is shorter by a third, or 2,500 nautical miles. The IPCC says the shorter journey means significant fuel savings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships. It adds, however, that the increase in shipping on the Northeast Passage, from only 50 cargo vessels a year at present, will coincide with the breeding season for whales and other marine mammals and could damage populations. It says Arctic oil and gas ""will play a growing role in the world economy"". The region is thought to contain 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered gas and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil. The report adds a cautionary note that ""due to high costs and difficult access conditions the impact on future oil and gas production in the Arctic remains unclear"". Lisa Raitt, Canada's Transport Minister, warned this week that a single drilling accident would be a publicity disaster. ""I can tell you, one oil spill or accident in the Arctic is going to be a visual you do not want,"" she said, adding that much more work needed to be done to make shipping movements safe. ""Bringing those gigantic container ships through areas where it is shallow, first of all, and there is not a lot of navigational markers, it is far riskier than other routes."" The report concedes that there are conflicting opinions among scientists over how much impact global warming will have on populations. It says there is only ""medium agreement"" on forecasts that two-thirds of the world's polar bears will be lost by 2050. It concludes that ""extinction of polar bears is unlikely"" but there is ""very high confidence"" that sub-populations will disappear in some areas.

"In Bjørndalen, Norway, a Small Cabin Enjoys Some of the World's Fastest Internet; Svein Nordahl Has No Running Water, but Quick Access to the Web; More Polar Bears Than People",Norway,"SVALBARD, Norway—On a cold shore in the icy archipelago of Svalbard, a relative stone's throw from the North Pole, a small cabin belonging to Svein Nordahl is a hive of activity. He has no running water and not one of Svalbard's 31 miles of roads stretches as far as Bjørndalen, the small community of scattered shacks where he has made his home. But the isolated outpost has been fitted with some of the highest quality Internet available, allowing Mr. Nordahl and his neighbors lightning-quick access to the World Wide Web. High-speed broadband is a rare luxury for the 2,600 or so brave souls living here. In the land many consider the northernmost human dwelling in the world, inhabitants cope with inconvenience as a way of life. There are more polar bears than people, for instance, so residents are urged not to roam beyond village limits without a gun. And the ground is eternally frozen, making it more convenient to thaw a glass of snow in the microwave than it would be to try to install running water. Planning for birth? Or death? The rule of thumb is to travel south in search of better care than what's available at the local hospital. ""There's no safety net,"" Kåre Stensen, a Dane working at the local watering hole, the ""Svalbar,"" said while serving coffee and wiping down tables. ""You're on your own."" A quarter of the people living here leave every year, making room for a fresh batch of adventurers unlikely to linger very long. One area where Svalbardians have it made, however, is online. While most of this high Arctic territory lacks high-speed Internet, Svalbard enjoys speeds estimated to be 10 to 20 times as fast as any in the rest of Norway. That means the 64-year-old Mr. Nordahl spends hours luxuriating in a kingdom of iPads, PCs and a flight simulator connected to a 10-foot-long screen that lowers from the ceiling. His entire household being powered by diesel generator, his computers have 43 terabytes of capacity, or enough to store at least 60,000 full-length HD movies. Mr. Nordahl lives in a 750-square-foot cabin built on the tip of a rock that juts out into a body of water known as Ice Fjord. When he got wind of plans by Telenor ASA to bring fiber-optic broadband to every household in Longyearbyen, Svalbard's main hub of 2,000 people located 5 miles to the southwest, he began hatching a moonshot plan to get in on the action. But there was a problem. Given his distance from Longyearbyen, Mr. Nordahl and those in neighboring cabins were to be left in the cold on this project. Still, the former schoolbook translator marched up to the local Telenor office and made a blunt demand: ""I want to have fiber in my cabin."" Mr. Nordahl's apparent sense of entitlement toward better Internet partially stems from the fact he is Norwegian. Although he came to Svalbard almost three decades ago, lured by stories of adventure on top of the world, he didn't leave behind the egalitarian ethos that defines his people. One of the staunchest and wealthiest welfare states in the world, Norway bends over backward to extend generous services to its five million people, regardless of where they live. The nation's mainland is composed of 428 local municipalities, some with sparse populations tucked in remote corners of the Nordics—all have access to expensive doctors and good quality schools, funded by taxpayers and the profits of a booming oil and gas industry. Extending these rights to Svalbard is tricky. While Norway is technically sovereign over the archipelago, the Svalbard Treaty of 1920 gave 42 nations the right to conduct commercial activities there, and Norwegians can collect only enough taxes to fund local services for a diverse clutch of inhabitants, including Russians, Ukrainians, Swedes and Thais. A few years ago, state-controlled Telenor decided to upgrade Longyearbyen's infrastructure with fiber optics and a 4G mobile network in an attempt to scrap older technologies like copper, coaxial cable and older generation mobile networks. Seeing Svalbard as ""a miniature version of mainland Norway,"" Telenor Chief Technology Officer Frode Stødal reckoned that the small community would be good place to try out this technical overhaul before exporting it to the mainland. ""We quickly get feedback on what works and what doesn't,"" Mr. Stødal said during a recent visit to the archipelago. Being left out of this project wasn't welcome news for Mr. Nordahl, a tech enthusiast whose interest in computers goes back to his pre-Svalbard days. So he got to work, drawing up a plan to get miles of fiber extended to his little village of Bjørndalen, named for the polar bears that often stroll by. In 2011, he struck a deal with Telenor, offering to drag the cables to the village himself. The operator said if he could get about 15 people to sign a petition, they would act on his plan. Working over the brief summer, when temperatures can rise to as high as 40 degrees Fahrenheit, he collected 43 signatures from cabin owners in Bjørndalen. The following summer, he and his fellow townsfolk punched through the hard ground with shovels to excavate the few inches of trench needed to lay the cable. He's not the only one enjoying the connectivity. Mr. Stødal, the Telenor executive, said Svalbard is now ""at least 10 years ahead"" of mainland Norway. The telecom company, meanwhile, has seen its costs for maintenance plummet and is now planning to rid the archipelago of traditional phone lines. Terje Aunevik, an executive at Longyearbyen's Pole Position Logistics A/S, said higher-speed broadband puts Svalbard more firmly on the map at a time when Arctic shipping activity is growing and ""champagne tourists"" pass by on high-cost expeditions to the North Pole. His company, one of about 100 here, is increasingly dependent on the Web to survive. ""Before we got fiber we struggled a bit,"" he said. ""Capacity used to be unreliable during peak season, but now it is as stable as it gets."" Mr. Stensen, working at the ""Svalbar,"" doesn't expect life to change dramatically though. With several months of darkness and average winter temperatures falling to 3 degrees Fahrenheit, he expects the ""Klondike atmosphere"" to endure. These days, however, there is a silver lining. ""We never have any trouble streaming or downloading movies."""
Norway's Plan for Memorial to Victims of Breivik Killings Runs Into Resistance,Norway,"A plan to slice through a peninsula as a memorial to victims of the 2011 mass killings in Norway has run into resistance from the families of some of the dead as well as people living near the site and geologists who question the project's viability. Officials at Norway's public art program, Koro, in February selected a design created by Swedish artist Jonas Dahlberg to honor the 77 people killed by the political extremist Anders Behring Breivik. Mr. Dahlberg's idea is to cut a narrow channel through the Sorbraten peninsula across from the island of Utoya, where most of the killing took place. Koro described the concept as creating ""a wound or a cut within the landscape itself."" But not everyone is impressed with a memorial that would be almost a mile away from where the tragedy occurred. ""My daughter died on Utoya and not the mainland opposite to it,"" Vanessa Svebakk, whose daughter Sharidyn was 14 years old when she was shot by Mr. Breivik, said in an interview. ""I therefore oppose that memorial."" At the same time, some of those living nearby feel it is too close to home. ""I will never be able to forget what happened,"" said Jorn Overby, who lives on the mainland opposite Utoya and went out to help rescue people that day--July 22, 2011--on his boat. But he said he doesn't want to be confronted with a visible reminder--not to mention the tourist traffic it would draw--every time he leaves his house. He and some neighbors recently hired a high-profile lawyer, Harald Stabell, to try to block the project or relocate it. ""We aren't allowed to leave it behind us,"" Mr. Overby said of the tragedy. The murders, the worst in Norway's peacetime history, affected all parts of the country and dozens of memorials have been erected throughout Norway. Ms. Svebakk said her family is content with the existing memorials, including Sharidyn's grave and a tree the family planted in Ms. Svebakk's home country of New Zealand. Per Sture Helland Pedersen, father of Asta Sofie Helland Dahl, who was 16 when she was killed, agreed with Ms. Svebakk, saying the island itself is the right place to mourn. Meanwhile, some geologists have warned that the project will be more complicated than anyone has realized. The proposed site is little more than a ""pile of gravel disguised as a rock,"" said Hans Erik Foss Amundsen, a consultant to the oil and gas industry. Under those conditions, cutting out 3 1/2 meters, or 11 1/2 feet, could be ""far more expensive than anticipated,"" he said. Jorn Mortensen, who headed the jury that unanimously chose the design, said the artist was aware of this, and that using concrete for stabilization might be a possibility. ""Further investigations of the ground will be undertaken,"" he said. The memorial does have the backing of the main support group for survivors and families of victims, which was represented on the jury. The group's leader Trond Henry Blattmann, who lost his son on Utoya, said in an interview that he felt the decision-making was democratic. Mr. Mortensen said that opponents will be able to make their voices heard at an information meeting on April 9. ""It is also important to underline that no name will be written on any memorial without the victim's relatives giving permission,"" he said, adding that all will be asked. Ms. Svebakk and Mr. Pedersen, who don't belong to the support group, said they would not allow their children's names on the memorial as currently conceived.

Canada boycotts Arctic Council meeting in Moscow,Norway,"Canada boycotted Arctic Council meetings in Russia this week in protest of Russia's ""illegal occupation"" of Ukraine, Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Tuesday. Aglukkaq is responsible for the Canadian Northern Development Agency and currently chairs the Arctic Council. She said the boycott of the working-group level meetings in Moscow was ""as a result of Russia's illegal occupation of Ukraine and its continued provocative actions in Crimea and elsewhere. However, she added, ""Canada will continue to support the important work of the Arctic Council."" The Arctic has seen growing international interest in recent years, as global warming causes the Arctic ice cap to melt and opens new navigation routes that facilitate the use of previously inaccessible raw materials. Canada currently holds the rotating, two-year presidency of the Arctic Council, which promotes cooperation on issues such as environmental protection, oil and gas mining, shipping, fishing and tourism. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States are also members. The two-day meeting in Moscow was to discuss methane and black carbon -- a fine particulate matter that warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing the ability of snow and ice to reflect sunlight. amc/oh"
"G2: →: ←: 10.5%: 9.5%: 45%: 60%: Treasure of the Gobi desert: Once a poor Soviet satellite famous for cashmere and Genghis Khan, Mongolia is now booming with the profits of coal mining. But what does it mean for the nation's nomadic heritage? Tania Branigan reports Photographs by Dan Chung: Minegolia in numbers",Norway,"The icy wind gusting across the Gobi slices through clothing, scours the rock and churns the coal piles, blowing dust into clouds 50 metres above us and fogging the horizon to a grey-beige blur beneath the perfect blue. Soot coats mouths and nostrils and blackens faces. Wrapped in heavy workwear, his eyes shielded by dark goggles beneath his hard hat, Amarsanaa Batsuren strides across this remote and unlovely stretch of desert. He is on his way to inspect an ugly gash in the earth, 500m by 800m and growing fast. ""Brilliant, innit?"" he says, and flashes a grin. A year ago, Amarsanaa was ensconced at home in London's Victoria. This opencast mine has lured him back to Mongolia after 20 years in the capital. ""The Gobi's a horrible place to work. But this job - this all ends up as Mongolia's food,"" he says, his voice tinged with pride. We are standing on an estimated 6bn tonnes of coking and thermal coal. Tavan Tolgoi, believed to be the world's largest such deposit, is one of the mammoth mineral veins that could transform a country where a quarter of the population are still nomadic herders. In the last few years, this vast but sparsely populated nation - four times the size of the UK, with fewer than 3 million inhabitants - has seen an astonishing boom. The impoverished former Soviet satellite, best known for cashmere and Genghis Khan, has enjoyed double-digit growth and even more spectacular hype. In 2010, the Mongolian stock exchange grew 121%; the following year, GDP shot up by over 17%. The IMF estimated that by 2021 the copper and gold produced at Oyu Tolgoi - a multibillion project jointly owned by Mongolia and Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill - could account for 30% of the country's economy. It earned the nickname Minegolia. Not everyone celebrated. The advent of such huge schemes sparked soul-searching about their social and environmental cost. Some warned of ""the resource curse"", with a rush of foreign money creating a rising real exchange rate that hits other sectors. Others feared outsiders would reap all the profits. Tough new laws restricting foreign investment in strategic assets and an attempt to renegotiate the Oyu Tolgoi deal - along with the slowing of the Chinese economy, which has powered the Mongolian surge - saw foreign direct investment plummet by 54% last year. The IMF had predicted almost 23% growth; the actual rate was half that. To drive north through the Gobi and across this immense, largely untamed land, towards the capital's glassy new towers, is to trace a country in transition and uncertain of its trajectory. The highway to Ulan Bator has longish stretches of brand-new black asphalt and steamrollers at work on bulldozed sections in between; then we are back on the rutted track that swerves across the grasslands, past camel herds and beneath soaring eagles. A wide, shimmering rainbow hangs over a distant mountain. We begin at Tavan Tolgoi, where Amarsanaa and his colleagues live in an encampment of gers, the white, round, felted tents of herders. The stars are still out as the men stamp off to relieve the night shift. They produce 350 to 450,000 tonnes a month, and even working round the clock they could be here for a century or more. Excavators carve out five tonnes in a single scoop. The wheels of 300-tonne coal trucks dwarf the burly men beside them. The new pit, already 27 metres deep, will soon descend to 10 times that. Mongolians are tough, Amarsanaa says, proudly; suited to such a harsh environment. But only a few hundred work here. Modern mining creates few jobs; what matters is how Mongolia spends the wealth it creates. ""Digging it out is difficult, but managing it is the hardest,"" Amarsanaa says. From Tavan Tolgoi, the coal trucks rumble south to China, churning up dust and unsettling Uyanga Damchaa's animals. ""Maybe the people who own those mines are getting benefit from it - I don't know. But what the people who live here see is the whole area being dug out; holes here, holes there,"" says the 22-year-old. Everyone else has moved, she adds. Soon she will follow suit, with her little girl Duurenjargal and the rest of their family. ""It's just impossible to live here,"" says her father, Batjargal. ""It's not a nice thing when they destroy your pasture. I know this mountain, for instance, has spirits."" The compensation has been meagre. At the last parliamentary election, parties wooed voters with cash handouts - funded by pre-selling Tavan Tolgoi's coal. Since the costs of mining and transport then rose, ""what they were promising in the elections - everything to every citizen - was all a loan from China and now we are paying the debt. In the long run probably nothing will be left for the future of Duurenjargal. It's kind of bleak,"" he says. Such concerns have pushed a few to radical solutions. In January a Mongolian court jailed environmentalist Tsetsegee Munkhbayar and other ""Fire Nation"" activists for 21 and a half years each after they were accused of placing bombs near Government House and opening fire while delivering a petition on limiting mineral exploitation. (Others say the grenades were inactive and police initially confirmed that the only shot was fired accidentally.) Yet Tavan Tolgoi's pits, vast as they are, are a speck on the Gobi. And officials argue they are managing development more carefully than ever. ""Seven years ago, 42% of the country's territory was covered by exploration and mining licences - now it's down almost to 10%,"" says Oyun Sanjaasuren, minister for the environment and green development. ""Rather than hundreds and hundreds of small mines, it is probably better to have a smaller number of larger, responsible projects,"" which the government can monitor more easily. Batjargal concedes he might even move back if plans for a railway to transport the coal are carried through. The infrastructure drive is already showing results; as we drive north, new power lines march across the desert beside us. From a distance, the landscape seems otherwise unchanged: vast, sweeping and dotted with occasional gers. In Dundgobi province, we swerve off the road and bounce over the tussocks to a cluster of horses in the distance. Erdentugs Altangerel is milking his herd, a long robe - known as a deel - over his jeans. He brings us into his ger to share a bowl of the fermented mare's milk known as airag. The tent's poles and chests are ornately painted in traditional patterns, but there is satellite TV powered by solar panels, and a car parked outside. The 41-year-old is lyrical about herding life at its best (""If the weather's good, that's happiness"") and realistic about its challenges. Despite his concern at the environmental cost, he believes mining will help families like his. ""Mongolia will be a developed country and our lives will be better."" When the road is finished the long journey to the capital will take just a few hours. Buying goods should become cheaper; and better access to markets may mean a higher price for their cashmere. His family rely on their animals for meat, milk and dung for their stoves, but are no longer subsistence herders like their ancestors. In fact, says Ariell Ahearn-Ligham, who is researching herding at Oxford University, Mongolia ""is a place of almost constant change"". Herding was once organised around monasteries. As the Soviet era dawned, the herds were collectivised. And when the USSR disintegrated decades later, the newly unemployed returned to the land. The number of herders almost doubled. So did the country's livestock, to 45 million. The size and makeup of communal herds had been strictly controlled, but now a soaring international appetite for cashmere caused a surge in the number of goats. The shift exacerbated overgrazing and desertification, because they damage grassland; around 70% is now considered degraded. That is thought to be one contributor to the dzuds, or winter disasters - extreme cold and heavy snow, preceded by summer droughts - that have caused millions of animal deaths. Another is the inexperience of newer herders, and partial settlement as people invest in property and send their children to school in town. ""Someone has to go with the kid, so the husband manages the herd alone, or pays a friend to manage it. And if the winter disaster comes, only a few guys are left to deal with it,"" says Ahearn-Ligham. These days nomads have insurance for such catastrophes, as well as bank loans secured on their herds. An even bigger change is coming: local governments are formalising grazing rights. Families who lease pastureland move less, Ahearn-Ligham says, so it degrades faster. Mining is only a part of the larger integration of Mongolia into a global economy. ""Rationalisation and the impact of modernity is also happening in the countryside,"" says Julian Dierkes, an expert on the country at the University of British Columbia. ""There's a whole romanticisation discourse in Mongolia and outside that reinforces the sense of the eternal and unchanged - but a lot is happening and it's happening very quickly."" Munkhdul Badral, known as Mogi, can testify to just how fast Mongolia's shifts have been. He still recalls the day another boy stole his gum. ""I was actually chewing it,"" he says. He was nine years old, it was 1992, and Mongolia was at a post-Soviet nadir. Factory closures had thrown many out of work. Shops had bare shelves. Even secondhand gum was desirable. Now we meet in an American-style bar in Ulan Bator's fanciest mall, gazing down on Sukhbaatar Square where families are gathering for a wedding in their jewel-coloured deels. There are Louis Vuitton and Armani boutiques downstairs, though few shoppers. ""People are still getting used to capitalism,"" says Mogi, who runs a market intelligence firm, Cover Mongolia. That applies to politicians, too. ""They are making mistakes that to me seem just bizarre,"" he adds: the rapidly rescinded foreign investment law; the cash handouts; off-budget spending that circumvents the government's own fiscal stability rules. The precipitous decline in foreign investment has halted, but was perhaps a symptom as much as a problem. Investors have not always endeared themselves to Mongolians; hearing a mining boss compare Oyu Tolgoi to a cash machine was bound to set alarm bells ringing. ""There's an attitude problem, I guess, with both sides,"" Mogi says. ""The one with money and experience is patronising and the Mongolian side would be put in a position where they have been persuaded to do something they regretted. ""But there are enough experiences of other countries going through this. I'm hoping Mongolia has enough textbook material to avoid [the problems]. You have Chile, Norway, Scandinavian countries where they handled their mining or oil revenue successfully and didn't flood the economy."" Oyun, the environment minister, says Mongolia has little choice but to embrace the minerals rush: ""Until commodity prices went up we found it very, very difficult to create any growth. Our population is very small, so the local market is very small. It's a huge area with not enough infrastructure. If you want to manufacture and export anything it's almost impossible to compete against Chinese manufacturing. Whether we like it or not, at this stage, it looks like mining is one of the very few sectors that will drive the growth."" But dependence on mining would be risky, she agrees. ""We should invest the revenues into human capital: health, education, diversifying the economy. There's potential with tourism; big potential in agriculture - it's becoming more competitive and there will be more of a market in China. We should use mining as a bridge."" To see where the success or failure will play out, you need only drive along the potholed roads and muddy tracks into the ger districts that sprawl across the hillsides: a patchwork of orange, red and blue tin roofs and more tents, their white covers greyed with soot, hemmed in by ragged wooden fences. Over two decades, Ulan Bator has swelled to bursting point, absorbing more than a third of the country's population; many are former herders who fled here when dzuds wiped out their livestock. More than half of the capital's residents live in these districts, without proper roads or running water. Unemployment is 60% - triple the rate in other areas. Education rates are lower here; health considerably worse. In the mornings, Dolgorsuren Dalkhaa can see the glistening new towers around Sukhbaatar Square from her home; by afternoon, smog from old-fashioned stoves clouds the skyline. She offers a snack of dried curds in her colourful living room, where photos of her family take pride of place. They arrived in the capital in 2002 and quickly settled in, finding work. But now, the 49-year-old says, ""we can hardly make ends meet . . . Tea that used to be 1,000 tugriks is now 1,500. It's not just food, either. Even rubber gloves [she works as a cleaner] were 3,000 and are now 5,000."" Inflation stood at 10.5% last year; the previous year, at 14.5%. ""The wealthy will be just fine, but it hurts our lives and I'm afraid it's going to be worse,"" she says. It's even tougher for newcomers, who face fiercer competition for jobs and land for their gers. ""The gap between the rich people and the poor people is obvious. We can see on the television that the people at the top are corrupt and we wonder why the people at the bottom have to live like this."" They talk about urban redevelopment, she says, but ""I guess it isn't going to be happening any time soon."" There is plenty of reason for pessimism. The government and Rio Tinto have missed a key financing deadline for the expansion of Oyu Tolgoi, as discussions continue over the revenue split; Mongolia needs the money to fund spending pledges. The tugrik has tumbled against the dollar. And if foreign investment picks up again, the old concerns will revive, too. For every Chile, building a prospering economy on its mineral wealth, there is an Angola. Mongolia remains a poor country with endemic corruption, serious social problems and inadequate long-term planning. Yet the Asian Development Bank predicts a 9.5% growth rate this year. The proportion of the population living in poverty fell from 38.7% in 2010 to 27.4% just two years later. Mongolia has turned its potentially difficult position - sandwiched between two mighty neighbours - into an asset, cultivating ties with Russia, China and the US. It is rare, even unique, as a vibrant democracy in the region. Demographics are on its side: 45% of its population is under 24. That has an unexpected dividend, according to Sumati Luvsandendev, of the polling NGO Sant Maral; around 80% of Mongolians are optimistic. ""It's partly because there are still opportunities in this country; but also because the population is very young,"" he says. He has another striking statistic: over 80% believe the government should reduce or even eliminate income differences. You could trace that to Soviet education, but he thinks it goes deeper: ""When you have a sedentary life you can accumulate huge wealth and distribute it to a hierarchy; in Mongolian [nomadic] society the hierarchy was very simple and limited. The idea that you should share riches with your neighbour is actually an ethic in Mongolian society - and your chances of being an important person if you didn't do that were rather small."" The excavators at Tavan Tolgoi tear ever deeper into the earth; the steamrollers iron out the long road up to Ulan Bator; the herders check livestock prices on their mobiles; the cranes in the capital dip and turn. But in the end, it seems, Mongolia's development may owe as much to its past as its hunger for progress.

Croatian president calls on EU to address energy needs of its east members,Norway,"ZAGREB, April 28 (Hina) The Financial Times on Monday released the article headlined ""EU must address energy needs of eastern members"" in which the article's author, Croatian President Ivo Josipovic, comments on the European Union's energy and climate goals and suggests that the Union's new energy policy ""needs to address the interests of its eastern members if it is to achieve its overall goals."" ""Earlier this year, the EU put forward its new energy and climate goals for 2030. The new energy policy has since proved to be a deeply divisive topic between industry and climate advocates, and political leaders and EU technocrats,"" according to the article written by the guest writer, the Croatian head of state. ""An aspect of the EU’s energy future that has largely escaped mainstream discussion, though, is the divide between eastern and western EU member states,"" Josipovic writes underlining that the crisis in Ukraine ""underscores the vulnerability of eastern EU states to energy supply disruptions and price increases that harm competitiveness and energy security throughout the region."" ""With its new set of goals, the EU remains a global leader on clean energy and climate change. The new proposal for 2030 features a target of cutting EU carbon emissions by 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels, building on the already almost met goal of cutting emissions by 20 per cent before 2020. The EU is the only region in the world that is on track to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2°C in this century. However, economic challenges stand in the way of implementing the EU’s energy policy at the national level, as almost 30m jobs across Europe are at stake in heavy industries sensitive to rising energy prices,"" Josipovic notes. ""Energy security also raises concerns among the many EU member countries highly dependent on imported energy. The EU continues to rely on relatively few suppliers for its energy – almost three-quarters of the EU’s natural gas imports come from Russia, Norway and Algeria, while more than 60 per cent of the EU’s crude oil supplies arrived from Russia, Norway and Libya. The crises in Libya two years ago and in Ukraine this year highlight the importance of diversifying the EU’s energy supply."" ""The debate between those advocating for the EU to do more to support renewable energy investments and those who argue that existing subsidies are already hurting competitiveness across several industries misses a crucial point. Instead of subsidies for renewables, which have a limited impact on price formation, the main determinant of high energy prices in Europe remains the high cost of imported energy. Therefore, it is not a matter of choosing between progressive climate policy and jobs. Rather, each EU country should more aggressively develop its internal energy production that can substitute for costly imports while adhering to EU policy on renewable sources,"" the Croatian president added. ""If Brussels wants a successful climate policy, it should strongly support domestic energy production by EU member states. European countries should invest more in infrastructure and improve the market framework for domestic production. Many industries in countries such as Croatia and Poland, for example, depend on low energy prices. Both countries are dependent on energy imports from outside the EU. ""Yet both also have substantial gas resources – Poland has extensive shale gas reserves, while recent seismic imaging of the Adriatic Sea indicates Croatia also has substantial reserves of offshore gas and oil to explore. However, the purity of the Adriatic is a precious resource for Croatia’s important tourism sector that must be protected. For this reason, as it pursues the development of its offshore energy reserves, Croatia must take care to work under the highest environmental standards. ""Development of these domestic resources could address both competitiveness and climate concerns in the EU. The leading contributor to climate change – coal – could be substantially replaced with cleaner, domestically produced and cheaper gas. Research on energy prices by the European Commission has found that increasing gas supplies has predominantly come at the expense of coal, while renewables only grew in their share of the energy mix as overall gas supply increased,"" Josipovic writes. ""Coal, like gas, is also predominantly imported rather than produced within the EU. Diversifying supplies does not mean that the EU’s current gas, oil and coal suppliers, primarily Russia and Norway, will not continue to be important energy partners of the EU. What will change is that EU member countries will have more conceivable alternatives in the interest of energy security. ""The challenge of promoting both competitiveness and energy security would best be addressed by boosting energy production within the EU. Only if these issues are solved will all 28 member countries fully commit to a proposed climate policy that presents a convincing emissions reduction plan. To deliver on its goals as a global leader in climate policy, the EU also has to ensure the energy security and competitiveness of its eastern European members. For Croatia and many other EU countries, all three goals are equally important,"" Josipovic concludes."
Sale of pristine Arctic land sparks global coal rush,Norway,"World A swathe of the pristine Norwegian Arctic has gone on sale, but it's not the polar bear-spotting and dog-sledging opportunities which are expected to entice a buyer: it is the potentially lucrative coal mine in a corner of the world increasingly attracting the attention of resource-hungry nations. Norway's tourism office describes the Svalbard Islands - situated half way between the Norwegian mainland and the North Pole - as an ""untouched Arctic wilderness"" with three nature reserves, six national parks and 15 bird sanctuaries. But while about 65 per cent of the archipelago is protected, mining has been part of the landscape on the Svalbard Islands since its settlement in the early 20th century, and the 217sq km of land put up for sale recently is believed to hold about 25 million tons of coal. The Austre Adventfjord property is currently owned by the Horn family of industrialists, the Norwegian VG newspaper reported. A spat between the family and the Norwegian company with rights to the coal mine is believed to have spurred the sale. ""The property is now for sale and I have no comments,"" said the family's lawyer Sveinung Flaaten. No figures were given for the potential value of the land, but international financial institutions are reported to have been hired to help find a buyer, sparking debate about whether parts of the island should be allowed to fall into foreign hands. In an editorial, VG said Svalbard was of ""great strategic importance to Norway"". Willy Ostreng, a director at the Norwegian Scientific Academy for Polar Research, told the paper that firms from nations including Russia, the US and China might want to snap it up. ""China is in constant search of coal and other natural resources,"" Mr Ostreng said. ""By purchasing this property they can use Svalbard as a platform for a long-term plan in the Arctic Ocean basin."" While no foreign companies have publicly shown an interest, there is enthusiasm for the area's potential. The US Geological Survey estimates that 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas reserves and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil are in the Arctic. Until recently thick ice has prevented exploration, but as global warming causes the sea ice to thaw, companies and governments are eyeing both the uncovered assets and lucrative new trade routes."
"As the World Warms, Navy Strategists Plan for an Arctic Rush",Norway,"Approximately 25,000 polar bears live in and around the Arctic Circle. Climate change has put the majestic ursines, a longtime favorite of children’s books and Christmas cards, in peril. In 2008, the United States listed them as a “threatened species” under the Endangered Species Act, and populations have been on the decline since then. So when is it acceptable for a Marine to shoot one? The Navy is still trying to figure that out. Walter Berbrick, a retired Navy officer and a professor of war games at the U.S. Naval War College, was conducting the Fleet Arctic Operations Game in 2011, simulating, among other things, how the Navy would respond to an oil spill in the Arctic, when he discovered there were no rules of engagement for polar bears. “You’ve really got to be mindful of where you’re at and where they’re at,” Berbrick says, pointing out that polar bears travel in open waters and on ice floes where naval units would have to operate. “Folks need to be trained and deployed understanding their interaction with polar bears. The Navy needs some kind of specialized force protection training, policies, rules of engagement. “It’s something the Navy doesn’t think about or plan for or prepare for, because there hasn’t been a demand for it,” he says. Until now. In February, the Navy released the U.S. Navy Arctic Roadmap for 2014 to 2030, a document outlining naval preparations for the region. It doesn’t address rules of engagement for polar bears, but it does lay out various other necessities for Naval capabilities in the Arctic, from new satellite communications equipment to cold-weather training exercises. The Navy’s road map followed the Department of Defense’s “Arctic Strategy” report of November 2013 and the White House’s May 2013 “National Security Strategy for the Arctic Region.” The documents make up a nascent Arctic strategy. As global warming melts Arctic ice, the region is being opened to increased commercial activity like shipping, mining and drilling. And along with human activity comes foreign policy and military strategy. Strategists in the Navy and throughout the government are scrambling to put policies in place, develop technology and create a plan of action for this burgeoning region of commercial activity. A Very Chilly Canary The Arctic covers some 5.5 million square miles: 8 percent of the earth’s surface and 15 percent of its total landmass. Eight countries—Russia, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland and the United States—have territory that extends into the Arctic Circle. About 13 million people live within the Arctic Circle, around 7 million fewer than in the New York City metropolitan area. That’s because the Arctic has some of harshest climates on the planet: Temperatures dip to -50 F in the winter. Human-made climate change affects the whole world, but the Arctic is feeling its impact more quickly and dramatically than elsewhere. The Arctic is “global warming’s canary in the coal mine,” in the words of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Since 1978, the winter Arctic ice cap—the complete ice coverage that lasts through the winter and recedes in the summer—has shrunk by 12 percent every decade. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted melting Arctic ice as one of the first serious casualties of global warming. And these changes are happening faster than anyone predicted. “Climate models have consistently underestimated the rate of change in the Arctic,” Jan-Gunnar Winther, the director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, said in a recent interview with an environmental news website. “We must be aware that the future could bring yet more surprises in the region.” In the past year, Arctic sea ice was at the fifth-lowest level since recording began. The lowest level came in 2011. Disappearing sea ice is bad news for the planet, but not everyone is mourning. “It’s great if you’re a shipper,” says Laurence Smith, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the region. Cargo transit through the Russian Arctic Northern Sea Route hit an all-time high in 2013. There’s big money to be made in the Arctic, and climate change is making that possible. “The popular perception is that Arctic warming is going to open some treasure trove of resources,” Smith says. That will be true in several industries. Tourism to the region is growing. Warmer waters have increased fish stocks. Offshore oil drilling is expected to boom. The region contains up to 22 percent of the world’s untapped oil and gas deposits. Longer summers and less ice have already given oil companies strong incentives to start exploration. Less ice also means more ships. Moving around the North Pole could slash shipping times—and costs—for many countries that would be happy to avoid the Suez or Panama canals. Russia and China in particular have shown interest in northern shipping routes. It’s this increased activity that has the Navy looking to plot a course for the frigid region—both to support commercial activity and to be of assistance if there is trouble. Preparations go from grand strategy to the more mundane. If the Navy is to operate seriously in the Arctic, it will need icebreakers, ships that do exactly what their name implies. Other Arctic states have invested heavily in these. Russia has 30, and Canada has 13. The United States has just three, all of which belong to the Coast Guard and are not powerful enough for Arctic operations. On the less expensive side of naval preparation are things like writing a new “Cold Weather Operations Handbook,” something the Navy hasn’t updated since 1987, according to Robert Freeman, a public affairs officer at the Navy’s Office of the Oceanographer. The old version is basically useless. For example, the old operations handbook suggests that if sea spray freezes on the outside of a ship, sailors should take a baseball bat to chip it away. That’s not going to work anymore, Freeman says. “In the modern Navy, we have all kinds of very sophisticated and intricate weapons systems on the surface of a ship. You can’t hit them with a baseball bat.” But even if there are challenges, there are also tailwinds making the Navy’s life easier. The Arctic remains one of the few areas where international cooperation is the norm rather than the exception. The region is governed through the Arctic Council, a forum in which Arctic states and interested observers iron out issues involving the region, from environmental protection to border disputes. When Russia planted a flag on the North Pole in 2007, many commentators speculated that it would launch a series of land grabs in the world’s least hospitable region. It never came to pass. Military-military cooperation abounds, too. U.S. naval officers engage in training exercises with Russian and Norwegian counterparts. The navies of Arctic countries share information and expertise on science and cartography. Even as tensions have flared between Russia and the United States in recent weeks over Ukraine, relations remain good on Arctic issues. “Russia does want to be a partner with the other Arctic states,” says Rear Admiral Jonathan White. “We’re not seeing anything to be concerned about.” The reason, according to White and independent Arctic analysts, comes back to money. “All the Arctic nations have things to gain, with additional access to resources, trade routes, fishing and tourism,” White says. “I’m optimistic that we can do it together. But just like any other ocean in the world, we have to be ready.”"
Under fire Australian miners look to repair their image,Norway,"Tony Brown typically spends his days ferrying tourists to and from the Great Barrier Reef. But last month, the charter boat operator flew to Europe where he helped persuade Deutsche Bank and HSBCnot to fund the expansion of a coal port that green groups claim could destroy the world heritage listed site. ""The dredging required to build the port is a risk to the reef and the A$6bn tourist industry that depends on it,"" says Mr Brown, who has vowed to continue the fight to block what would become the world's largest coal port at Abbot Point in Queensland. The decision by the banks is the latest victory in a global campaign being waged against the funding of fossil fuel projects and companies by green groups, which allege they are causing catastrophic global warming. In Australia the threat posed by increasing activism is prompting ""Big Coal"" to hit back via TV and social media campaigns plus the funding of community projects aimed at bolstering the mineral industry's reputation. Pioneered by Bill McKibbon, founder of the US environmental group 350.org, the ""divest from fossil fuel"" campaign is chalking up successes with companies such as Storebrand and Rabobank agreeing not to fund coal or shale gas projects. Under pressure from campaigners Norway is reviewing whether its $840bn sovereign wealth fund should stop investing in coal, oil and gas. ""We target the financiers for fossil fuel projects because they can't proceed without money,"" says Ben Pearson of Greenpeace Australia. ""When a bank such as Deutsche says it won't fund a project it also pressurises politicians, who must grant approvals."" A report by Oxford university's Smith School has found the ""divest campaign"" is growing faster than any other previous attempt to force companies to pull funding from resource projects. ""Divestment is not the main problem,"" says Ben Caldecott, co-author of the report. ""The risk is it pressurises politicians to introduce tougher regulations and stigmatises companies."" In Australia the ""Save the Reef"" campaign is alarming Australia's resources sector, which has traditionally enjoyed strong government, corporate and public support but is facing rising levels of environmental and local opposition. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest natural feature on earth, an ecosystem created by living organisms. Billions of tiny creatures known as coral polyps have built the reef over the past 600,000 years. Its ecological importance and key position in the Australian psyche has attracted a diverse group of opponents against a port expansion that is needed to develop huge coal mines in the Galilee Basin. Unesco has warned it may place the reef on its endangered list as a result of the port expansion, which has been approved by the Queensland and Australian federal governments. The resources industry says campaign groups are peddling misinformation. ""This is the sort of campaign we've come to expect against our industry - choose an iconic symbol and claim it is under threat,"" says Stephen Galilee, chief executive of the Minerals Council of New South Wales, an industry trade body. ""There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to suggest that it is harming the reef."" Environmental campaigners and some scientists disagree, saying dumping 3m tonnes of dredged mud 40km away from the reef poses a risk to the fragile ecosystem. Research conducted by JWS Research for the Minerals Council of Australia, before Deutsche and HSBC's decision, concluded professional investors in Australia are resistant to anti-coal rhetoric. But the coal industry has stepped up lobbying and advertising activities in response to a rise in local activism against resource projects and concerns that campaigners are beginning to exert influence over politicians. It has set up a website Australians for Coal, which urges mine workers and their families to contact their politicians to show their support for the industry. It is running TV adverts supporting the expansion of Abbot Point port and a children's character ""Hector the Lump of Coal"" is urging children to enter a writing competition. The current charm offensive is the biggest since the mining industry spent an estimated A$22m in 2010 in a nationwide lobbying and advertising campaign aimed at defeating the mining tax. ""It's a big risk to our industry and to any industry that noisy minority groups can pressure and bully weak governments into making regulatory responses to perceived political problems,"" says Mr Galilee. Opponents of mine expansions counter that the lobbying power of the minerals industry and the donations it makes to political parties often overrides local concerns. In 2012 the Minerals Council of Australia, the largest of several mining advocacy groups, collected A$35.4m revenue and spent A$12.7m on advertising and promotions. ""These types of campaigns can be very effective. It's all about repositioning the public debate and highlighting the positives of coal, such as providing heat and power,"" says Rohan Miller, senior marketing lecturer at Sydney University. ""Think of the free toys in kids meals at McDonald's and Joe Camel in tobacco."" In the village of Bulga in the Hunter Valley, John Krey of the Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association won two court cases blocking expansion of a Rio Tinto coal mine, which he says would annihilate the area. In response the New South Wales government has tweaked its planning laws to prioritise economics - Rio Tinto is preparing a new application. ""The government and the mine are on the same side. Both of them are our enemy because we are now fighting for our survival against two very big players,"" says Mr Krey."
Tanzania faces delays to export natural gas,Norway,"Tanzania's hopes of becoming an exporter of natural gas face fresh delays after the country's opposition refused to participate in further talks to rewrite the constitution. The constitutional review, which campaigners have likened to a ""small revolution"", is key to Royal Dutch Shell's hopes of searching for hydrocarbons in Tanzania's Zanzibar archipelago. Other international energy companies, including ExxonMobil of the US, Norway's Statoil and London-listed BG Group and Ophir, are also waiting for legislation held up by the constitutional proceedings before pushing ahead with multibillion-dollar investments to develop the country's substantial gas discoveries. The delay prolongs the constitutional uncertainty over whether Zanzibar, which has its own semi-autonomous government, can sign its own exploration deal and thus secure all the revenues. East Africa's fastest-growing economy was due to put a new constitution, dealing with everything from curtailing presidential powers to the relationship between mainland Tanganyika and the tourist islands of Zanzibar, to a popular referendum next year. But the opposition boycott and several missed deadlines mean the new law is unlikely to be approved before presidential elections scheduled for October 2015. ""The deadlines have beaten us,"" said Deus Kibamba, a constitutional expert. Freeman Mbowe, chairman of the opposition Chadema party that is boycotting the constitutional debate, said an opposition umbrella group had no plans to return to talks when the assembly is due to reconvene in August. ""[A new constitution] is an opportunity to heal our wounds that have been sustained for the last 50 years of our independence ... [but] we saw no hope of achieving the dream,"" he said. The constitutional disagreement centres on whether Tanzania will continue to comprise of two governments - a semi-autonomous one for Zanzibar and an overreaching one for both Zanzibar and mainland Tanganyika - or three, one each for Zanzibar, Tanganyika and Tanzania, the name given to their 1964 union. Zanzibar, a largely Muslim archipelago, has long agitated for greater independence and last year signed a deal with Shell to unlock a decade-delayed hydrocarbons deal. But Tanganyika and Zanzibar have not delineated their sea boundaries and Tanzania has not legally confirmed Zanzibar's right to explore for oil and gas. Analysts believe the international groups eyeing Tanzania will now postpone final investment decisions until after next year's elections. This would mean Tanzania falling even further behind neighbouring Mozambique, which hopes to start exporting gas in 2018. ""It is holding up the process,"" an oil industry insider said of the dispute. ""[Companies] are ready to start the day they agree on a way forward … [but] there needs to be political will."" Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, said production was now unlikely until ""2022 at the earliest - a date at which the global gas market will probably face significant supply increases."" Othman Masoud Othman, Zanzibar's attorney-general, agreed that energy groups were unlikely to commit investments under the current uncertainty. ""You really have to have a very clear regime - that would need to start with the constitutional framework. The new constitution I think would just make [Shell's right to explore] clear and would add certainty,"" he said. Sospeter Muhongo, Tanzania's energy minister, insisted the country's gas policy was ""not held up"". But because of the constitutional review occupying lawmakers' time and even the same room, parliament was now unlikely to consider the policy until towards the end of the year. The delay - and its potential impact on the energy industry - is a blow for Jakaya Kikwete, due to step down next year as Tanzania's president, who hoped a new constitution would be the cornerstone of his legacy."
Small projects can make a huge impact,Norway,"If less is more, small can be big. For anyone trying to implement change, that's important to keep in mind. Often, though by no means always, smaller also means cheaper and easier. With less at stake in terms of money and government approvals, small ideas can be relatively easy to realize. Yet their impact can be huge. One of the best examples came recently from Krumbach, a village (pop. 1,000) in Austria that invited seven architects to design seven bus shelters in their community. The results, though not necessarily practical from a passenger's point of view, are spectacular. When the shelters were unveiled weeks ago, the story - with plenty of eye-catching photographs - was picked up around the world. Suddenly, a tiny burg few had ever heard of was a media darling. In one fell swoop - well, maybe seven - Krumbach, small, unknown, invisible and unloved, became the object of international attention, made itself a destination and gained global admiration in the process. How clever these Krumbachians must be, we thought, how original and innovative. How daring. Krumbach didn't even have to pay the architects for their services; each was given a week's holiday in town, free. They, too, understood that participating in this design exercise would help put them on the architectural map, something it obviously managed to do. The shelters themselves are brilliant, frankly conceptual and visually striking. One, a dramatic tipi-shaped structure by Belgian architectural firm, dvvt, seems destined to star in countless postcards, posters and postage stamps. Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto's contribution is a stand of steel poles that support a stairwell, nothing that remotely resembles a conventional bus shelter. The shelter, of course, was merely a starting point, a hook on which to hang a series of purely architectural explorations of a village that aspired to more. The real objective was to entertain, provoke, amuse, impress, engage. . . . All of which were accomplished. An even more remarkable program was launched by the Norwegian government in 2005. Being one of the smartest and richest countries on the planet, Norway decided to boost travel and tourism by commissioning numerous local architects, the majority relatively young and inexperienced, to design stops along its most scenic highways. That meant everything from public toilets and picnic benches to lookouts and overnight cabins. Some were minimalist interventions; others were more substantial. Among the most memorable is the Aurland Lookout in western Norway. Completed in 2006, the breathtaking structure was designed by architects Todd Saunders (born in Newfoundland but based in Norway) and Tommie Wilhelmsen. It offers vertigo-inducing views over a fiord, but makes every effort to blend in with the landscape, as spectacular as it is. The point of the exercise was to increase tourism, promote architecture and innovation, stimulate Norwegian design culture and create beauty. Using the country's vast oil wealth, Norway was able to spend $377 million on the project, but this sort of program doesn't need to be expensive to succeed. Cheap and cheerful can work just as well as costly and clever. And ironically, perhaps, the more humble the objective - bus stops and rest stops - the more remarkable the achievement. The idea that these sorts of interventions are a mere frill misses the point. At a time when the public sector is under enormous pressure to cut back, spend less and sound austere, fancy tourist facilities are not a priority. No longer is that true. In fact, in the worldwide competition to attract capital - human and economic - these are precisely the sort of minor yet compelling moves that give a community an edge. It's similar to but different from the Bilbao Effect, which occurs when a single structure such as Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, turns around the fortunes a city. These have the same effect but with much less cost and effort. Think about how New York transformed Times Square - and itself - with a few cans of paint to mark off the street, planters, tables and chairs. That was all it took to reclaim whole swaths of roadway for pedestrians. Total cost: a few thousand dollars. Christopher Hume can be reached at chume@thestar.ca"
Polar bear U: Student life at the Harvard of the Arctic,Norway,"LONGYEARBYEN, NORWAY—Orientation at the world’s most northern university is a guaranteed blast, even without the cavorting of frosh week mixers or sorority rushes. Students at the University Center in Svalbard [http://www.unis.no/] (UNIS) spend a lot of time outdoors in a desert of snow and ice where polar bears roam. So, before they crack the books, new arrivals need to show a sharp aim. When Vincent Carrier, 24, arrived here from Quebec’s Laval University in July 2011, the Canadian marine biology student spent his first hours as all newcomers must: on the rifle range, learning how to shoot a bolt-action Ruger 30-06. No one can recall anyone killing a polar bear since the university opened in 1993. Just the same, no one’s taking any chances. At an outdoor shooting range, Carrier had to fire four bullets into a bull’s-eye from 35 metres to get a passing grade. Flunk the rifle test and you can’t sign out a firearm from the university’s gun locker. Which means you have to depend on classmates to have your back during fieldwork. Carrier’s academic life is spent studying the DNA of marine life too small to be seen under a microscope. But after two years in Longyearbyen, with at least seven rifle training sessions, he talks guns and bears with the nonchalance of a trapper. “I won’t start competitive shooting,” he deadpans. “Basically, it’s more about . . . aiming and hitting your target. Because a polar bear is really big. You cannot miss it. It’s 800 kilograms coming straight toward you and no matter where you shoot, you will stop it.” At 78 degrees north latitude and just 1,300 kilometres south of the North Pole, Longyearbyen is the northernmost community in the world. Canada’s most northerly hamlet, Grise Fiord [http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/02/03/french_family_gets_taste_of_life_in_canadas_northernmost_town.html], sits at 76 degrees north latitude, on the southern tip of Ellesmere Island. There lies the big attraction of UNIS: Unlike most of the world’s universities studying the Arctic, with costly trips north for field work, the wild Arctic surrounds UNIS. The warm north Longyearbyen is on a fiord warmed by the North Atlantic Drift, an ocean current fed by the Gulf Stream, which helps moderate Arctic temperatures that freeze the sea to thick ice at similar latitudes in Canada’s High Arctic. The town creeps up a valley toward the base of soaring mountain cliffs on the west coast of Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago. For a community of just under 2,100 people, built on coal mining and permafrost, it’s surprisingly cosmopolitan. That’s in large part because of a quirk of history called the Svalbard Treaty, an accord that followed the First World War. John Munro Longyear [http://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee.asp?i=186&b;=inductees.asp&t;=n&p;=L&s;=], an American who made his money mining and felling timber in Michigan, co-founded the Arctic Coal Company in 1906 to exploit seams of coal here, born of prehistoric tropical rain forests that covered Spitsbergen millions of years ago. The archipelago was a no man’s land, or terra nullius, until 1920, when a postwar treaty recognized Norwegian sovereignty over the islands, with conditions attached. A key clause grants the citizens of any country that signs the treaty equal access to the archipelago, including the freedom to carry out any maritime, industrial, mining and commercial operations. Today the list of signatories totals 40 nations, including Canada, the U.S., Russia and China, along with middle powers such as Saudi Arabia and South Africa. A few small countries with no discernible interest in the High Arctic have also signed the treaty, including Afghanistan, Albania and the Dominican Republic. Their citizens can set up shop in Longyearbyen any time the urge moves them. Little Thailand The second-largest nationality in the town is Thai. Local legend has it that the first Thai settled here in the 1980s, when a Longyearbyen coal miner vacationing in Thailand found love and returned with a bride. As tourism grew, more Thais followed for jobs, mainly women who clean hotel rooms. The Thai community now numbers in the dozens, with a Thai grocery store and a Thai restaurant for a taste of home in a town where you’re more likely to find grilled whale meat on the table than tom yum soup. Norway’s Immigration Act doesn’t apply to the Svalbard islands so you don’t need a visa to live here. But residents also can’t claim any of Norway’s famously generous social services — not even assistance due to illness. There is still work mining coal here, largely to fire the town’s power plant, whose furnaces also pump hot water to homes. But tourism and science are a big part of the local economy. In summer, passengers pouring off a single cruise ship can double the population. And scientists flock to Svalbard from around the world for the unique research opportunities. So Longyearbyen is a worldly frontier town — kids at the local public school speak dozens of languages — but anyone who decides to stay for the cold charm has to be a survivor, with a fat wallet. At the Svalbardbutikken [http://www.svalbardbutikken.no/index.php?action=3] co-op store, a loaf of bread costs $6.50, a litre of milk more than $5.30. Beer is cheaper because alcohol is tax free, which helps when the sun doesn’t set for about four months a year. Tourism magnet In the short summer, it’s easy to walk from one end of Longyearbyen to the other, with eyes peeled for any wayward polar bears. Come winter, the place is abuzz with snowmobiles, which locals call snow scooters. Tax free, they’re so cheap the town has some 4,000 snowmobiles, roughly two per person. There are as many trucks, tractor and cars, including a white stretch limo. Dog sledding is a popular tourist attraction and hundreds of huskies are housed in outdoor kennels on the edge of town, where their penchant for nighttime howling won’t keep anyone awake. A steady stream of the world’s leading Arctic experts flows in and out of Longyearbyen because it’s easier to reach than most places this far north and it has superb facilities, including the Svalbard Satellite Station, or Svalsat. With more than 31 antenna systems, it is the world’s largest commercial ground station, and the only one that can communicate with satellites through 14 orbits each day, 365 days a year. Fibre-optic cables give Longyearbyen and its high-tech equipment a high-speed Internet connection to the world, which is how Carrier stumbled upon the university, which is becoming a kind of Harvard of the Arctic. He was an undergraduate at Laval with a wanderlust fed by a stint in the Antarctic in 2009. He Googled for courses on Earth’s southernmost continent at Australian universities, which were too expensive. A typo, or perhaps the fateful hand of autocorrect, solved that problem: “I wrote ‘Antarctic university.’ But it turned out the word ‘Arctic’ showed up. That’s how I found UNIS.” Tuition is free at UNIS. There is an application fee, but that is only a little more than $100. So Carrier quickly applied and was invited to study Arctic biology. He’s still here, studying for a master’s degree and taking part in cutting-edge research crucial to understanding the impact of climate change. He’s also counting reindeer for the Norwegian Polar Institute. As a marine biologist, Carrier does a lot of work on boats, so he had to learn how to survive going overboard in the Arctic. His training included jumping into an icy fiord in a wet suit and in a leakier snowmobile suit. He also learned how to treat frostbite or give first aid to injured comrades. About 450 students from around the world are enrolled at UNIS each year, studying biology, geology, geophysics and technology. Roughly half come from outside Norway. Although students don’t have to pay tuition, Carrier has to pay about $45 for each day of fieldwork for food and accommodation. As an undergraduate, that cost him a total of about $800, he estimates. Trips on icebreakers and other big-ticket expenses are covered by the university and its financial backers, which include Norway’s government and several large oil companies. Students who can’t count on research grants or other support can expect big bills for living expenses. Student housing and food cost about $1,715 a month, the university estimates. Working with Laval professor Connie Lovejoy, Carrier is studying tiny sea life. He uses DNA analysis to identify species of phytoplankton, the first link in the food chain, and other organisms. He’s trying to figure out how they got here, whether they simply rode ocean currents or migrated with a purpose because of the ocean conditions. The secrets he’s uncovering may help answer critical questions about how climate change will affect all of us because the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth. Oceans play a major role in mitigating climate change because they absorb heat and the carbon that international scientists say is rapidly warming the planet. The marine micro-organisms Carrier is studying consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen through photosynthesis. Deep under the sea, their world is being turned upside down. “The ocean in the Arctic is really changing a lot,” Carrier says. “I’m just trying to answer one small question in a big issue.”"
"We will fight them on our beaches: Ibiza unites against oil prospectors: The waters surrounding the Balearic party island are a world heritage site - and conservationists, politicians and tourist chiefs are adamant that plans to drill in the sea must be stopped",Norway,"by Adam Vaughan Ibiza It is best known for all-night clubbing with top DJs such as Pete Tong and Fatboy Slim, an A-list celebrity crowd and partying, but Ibiza is also home to two national parks, environmentalists living off the grid on solar power, and is considered of such ecological and cultural importance that the UN designated the Balearic island and its surrounding waters a world heritage site. Now people with interests in both camps are uniting over the prospect of oil exploration several miles off the coast in the glittering Mediterranean waters, which are home to oceanic Posidonia, a giant seagrass only found in Europe. Whales, dolphins and turtles are among the species spotted in the Mediterranean around Ibiza. Last week in Ibiza Town's port, a crowd of people were vying not to get into the latest upmarket club but for a tour of the Rainbow Warrior. The Greenpeace ship arrived at the island on Wednesday to rally opposition, under a banner reading, simply: ""No oil"". Scottish oil explorer Cairn Energy, whose plans to look for oil in the Arctic have made it the target of green campaigners in the past , says that although it holds licences to explore for oil in the Gulf of Valencia, to the north-west of Ibiza, any seismic testing or the drilling of test wells is a long way off. The company is awaiting a decision on its environmental impact assessment by Spanish authorities due in late summer, which will determine whether it can continue. The government says Spain imports more than 99% of its oil and gas, at great expense, and that it must ensure energy security. In February, more than 10,000 people marched through Ibiza Town, and around 60,000 signed a petition against oil exploration in the region. Twenty people posed naked covered in mock oil for a piece of performance art. The battle went online, with a social media blitz by celebrities who regularly visit Ibiza, including singers Dannii Minogue and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. ""I'm against it, completely. Yes, it's selfish to say 'we are against it' and then use cars and phones, and not be against it in Africa or elsewhere. But this is our territory. I can't fight for Africa so I have to fight here. We don't really need oil,"" says resident Ida Kreisman, who runs a jewellery stall. Rebecca Gil, working for the summer at a clothes shop in Ibiza Town, says she recognises Spain's need for economic growth but exploring for oil is not the right approach. ""I understand the argument for it, but it's not the solution. The promise of money from the oil is a big lie."" A straw poll of waiters, taxi drivers, hotel workers and street entertainers found all apparently opposed to the prospect. ""They are crazy. It is a beautiful island. This is a paradise,"" says busker Juan Sanchez, standing in the shadows of the great medieval walls surrounding the hilltop cathedral. Even local politicians have been surprised at the degree of unanimity. ""It is the first time people speak with one voice against a project like this. I cannot remember another time. This is the beginning of something,"" says Vicent Serra, president of the island's local government, the Consell of Ibiza. Serra is a member of the Popular Party, which is in power in Madrid and has argued in favour of exploring for oil, but he says he will put Ibiza first. ""I am against oil prospecting here. I was voted to represent the people here."" Jaume Ferrer, his counterpart in Formentara, an 82-square mile island off the coast, is equally unequivocal. ""We feel threatened, attacked, because tourism is the main part of our economy. The tourism is based on our conservation of the environment. We say no."" Jose Romone-Bauza, the president of the Balearics - Ibiza, Majorca and Menorca - told thousands of protesters earlier this year: ""Our oil is tourism."" The sentiment is echoed by Joan Tur, president of Pimeef, a federation of 1,700 small and medium-sized businesses on Ibiza. ""90% of the economy here is tourism. The island is a jewel. We have pristine water and clean sand, we are careful about our environment. We cannot take the risk to have an incident. Even the fact of having an oil platform [nearby] would mean the island had less value,"" he says. The island's natural worth is evident when travelling around the coastline. The Posidonia, a flowering plant commonly known as Neptune grass, creates a five-mile underwater meadow to the south of Ibiza. Conservationists say it provides an important place for fish to breed, and serves an ecological function by cleaning the water. ""Cairn is looking at exploring for oil at depths of 1,000-1,500 metres, which would mean its platform had the same characteristics of Deepwater [Horizon, the source of the 2010 BP oil spill]. If there was a spill, it would be the 'Balearic problem' because of the currents,"" says Pilar Marcus, a campaigner for Greenpeace, speaking aboard one of the group's fast inflatable boats as two activists in the water held up placards reading, ""No prospecting."" Elsewhere in Spain, oil exploration is further ahead. In 2012 the government in the Canary Islands revived Spanish oil company Repsol's permit from 2001, which had been cancelled in 2004 by the supreme court after legal challenges. The move prompted outrage from environmentalists and locals who had previously fought the plans. Earlier this month, an environmental review handed Repsol the green light from Madrid to proceed with its exploration off Lanzarote and Fuerteventura, both popular British holiday destinations. Around 1,000 people protested in Telde on Gran Canaria during a public speech by the minister for energy and tourism, Jose Manuel Soria, who backs the search for oil. Riot police were deployed and video footage shows an officer hitting a demonstrator, leading to an investigation of an alleged assault. Wim Geirnaert, a campaigner at the Save Canaries group, said the government is not listening to locals. ""Nobody wants these oil rigs. The main concern is our industry is only based on tourism. The other concern is for wildlife - if you go sailing where they have a licence to explore you can see sometimes see hundreds of dolphins."" Many in the Canaries fear that though the Balearics could get a reprieve because the Popular Party is dominant on the island and is in government in Madrid, the Canaries - where the Canarian Coalition party holds sway - will not. ""There is a concern they [the government] will find an excuse in the Balearics, such as 'it is too close to the coast', but not in the Canaries,"" said Gerinaert. A spokesman for ACIEP, the association which represents oil exploration companies in Spain, said he understood concerns but added that the oil industry in the country was safe and mature, with tough legislation for the sector. ""In the BalearicIslands, of course tourism is very important. There may be people worrying about the impact on the tourism and the fishing industry but we have to say there will be no impact. It's possible to have both and no impact, as Norway have shown. Also, it's exploration, not extraction, which is simply a boat on the sea,"" said the spokesman. Cairn Energy's Spanish operation insists oil exploration in the region is not remarkable, claiming more than 200 oil wells have been drilled in the Spanish Mediterranean over the past 40 years. ""Exploration in the Spanish Mediterranean is not new,"" says its brochure. In Ibiza town, Kreisman, who is closing up her stall selling bracelets, remains sceptical. ""Everything is safe until it's not. Who says that it's safe?"" Captions: Main picture: Cala Benirras in Ibiza, where residents are fighting a plan to explore for oil.

"Is the world's biggest island playground threatened by oil drilling? ; Celebrity jet setters and inhabitants are sounding the alarm about possible oil drilling in Ibiza. Even Paris Hilton says, 'Ibiza is in danger.'",Norway,"Is the world's biggest island playground being threatened by the specter of oil drilling? That's the word from the locals who inhabit Ibiza and the celebrity jet setters who flock to it to enjoy its many clubs and pristine Mediterranean beaches. Backed into a corner because it imports more that 99 percent of its oil from other oil-producing countries and still staring down a dismal economic outlook, the Spanish government is considering allowing oil exploration off the coasts of Ibiza and Formentera, two of the four main Balearic Islands. The government is scheduled to decide in September after weighing the results of an environmental impact report. If approved, companies could start drilling as soon as next year. Celebrities including Diddy, Kate Moss, Sienna Miller and DJ Fatboy Slim are among those who oppose oil exploration on the grounds that it would threaten the Balearic ecosystem, which is home to dolphin pods, whales and Posidonia, an ocean seagrass only found in Europe. Even local politicians have been surprised at the degree of unanimity. 'It is the first time people speak with one voice against a project like this. I cannot remember another time. This is the beginning of something,' says Vicent Serra, president of the island's local government, the Consell of Ibiza. Serra is a member of the Popular Party, which is in power in Madrid and has argued in favour of exploring for oil, but he says he will put Ibiza first. 'I am against oil prospecting here. I was voted to represent the people here. The Scottish oil and gas company Cairn energy is pushing the Spanish government to allow drilling in area of about 1,500 square miles, 30 miles off the coast of Ibiza. Locals worry that drilling will hurt the primary driver of economic activity on the island — tourism. Each year, more than 2.5 million people flock to Ibiza on holiday, enough that's it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Ibiza is where Gumball 3000 founder Maximillion Cooper and rapper/actress Eve got married after this year's race, which concluded in Ibiza. ""Our oil is tourism,"" Balearic president José Ramón Bauzà told protesters a few months back. It's not just the sight of oil drilling platforms ruining the horizon that creates concern, but the way Cairn intends to search for oil — with underwater explosions that provide sonic information about rock formations. Ozy says the sound waves can reach as far as 20,000 feet into the ocean floor. Local fisherman are worried that it could dramatically decrease their catches, and Greenpeace has gotten involved, too, citing concerns that the 250 decibel explosions would harm and disturb bluefin tuna and striped dolphins. Even without an oil spill, the ramifications could be disastrous. An oil industry spokesman from the Spanish Association of Research Companies, Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons (ACIEP) has said that there could be no impact on marine wildlife, citing Norway as an example. But Norwegian fisherman have said their yields decreased by 50 percent when seismic surveys take place. ""Cairn is looking at exploring for oil at depths of 1,000-1,500 metres, which would mean its platform had the same characteristics of Deepwater [Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico],"" Greenpeace protester Pilar Marcus told the Guardian. ""If there was a spill, it would be the 'Balearic problem' because of the currents."" In the caption accompanying her Instagram post, Paris Hilton — yes, the 2000s celebutante party girl — explained her opposition to the company's desire for oil exploration: ""I'm against it, completely,"" local jewelry proprietor Ida Kreisman told The Guardian. ""Yes, it's selfish to say 'we are against it' and then use cars and phones, and not be against it in Africa or elsewhere. But this is our territory. I can't fight for Africa so I have to fight here. We don't really need oil."" h/t Ozy"
"Global Central Banking in 2014, A Second Quarter Update for 24 Economies -- WSJ Blog",Norway,"Five years after the global recession of 2009, economic growth remains troublingly weak and inflation uncomfortably low in many developed economies. Several emerging-market economies are expanding more slowly than in the past while inflation remains high. And housing prices appear frothy in some countries. Many of the world's central banks held policy steady in the second quarter, but some made moves or indicated they are preparing to act in the months ahead. The European Central Bank and the central banks of Mexico and Turkey were among those that cut interest rates in the April through June period. The central banks of Russia and New Zealand raised rates. The Bank of England sent signals it may this year become the first major advanced economy central bank to raise rates from record lows. And U.S. Federal Reserve officials kept winding down their bond-buying program while discussing how to raise rates when the time comes, with most expecting to start next year. Here's a guide to the individual outlooks for central banks around the world, compiled by our global staff of reporters and editors.

But Fed officials have been busy discussing when and how to start raising interest rates when the time comes. Fed officials' projections, released at their June meeting, showed 12 out of 16 of them expect to start raising short-term rates from near zero next year. Many economists and market participants expect the first hike sometime in the summer of 2015. The question of how to raise rates is more complicated. Fed officials are experimenting with different tools but haven't decided which to use, in what order, or how to possibly combine them. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, asked about the topic at her June press conference, indicated the issue is still up in the air. ""We've made quite a lot of progress in our discussion, but we've not yet reached conclusions,"" she told reporters. Before the financial crisis and recession, the Fed simply adjusted its benchmark federal funds rate to affect borrowing costs throughout the economy. Fed officials are now considering other ways of influencing short-term rates either instead of or along with the fed funds rate. One tool is the rate the Fed pays banks to park excess reserves at the central bank overnight. Another is the rate the Fed pays on large reverse repurchase agreements with other financial firms, a program in testing since September. Ms. Yellen emphasized ""these discussions are in no way intended to signal any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy."" So what is the Fed's underlying message? Policy makers are content with the economy's progress and expect it will be sturdy enough next year to withstand slightly higher interest rates. But Ms. Yellen repeated the word uncertainty several times during her press conference, emphasizing the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee ""will adjust policy to what it actually sees unfolding in the economy over time."" That may not offer much clarity on when rate hikes will start. But the parameters for such a move are clear: The Fed wants to see more job growth and inflation moving closer to its 2% target. European Central Bank By Brian Blackstone After unveiling a raft of measures in early June to stave off the threat of too-low inflation, the European Central Bank appears set for a lengthy summer pause. But its problems aren't going away. Annual euro-zone inflation, at 0.5% in June, may soften even more this summer to 0.3%, some analysts say, pushing it even further below the ECB's target of just under 2%. Lending to the private sector remains weak, and will likely remain so until banks get through ongoing health checks of their balance sheets. A new targeted ECB lending program won't begin until September, suggesting these trends are unlikely to reverse anytime soon. The ECB on June 5 reduced its key interest rates and installed a negative rate on bank deposits parked with it, which should encourage banks to lend to each other rather than leave surplus funds at the central bank. The ECB also said it would offer banks cheap loans and four-year maturities, starting in September, on the condition that they extend more credit to the private sector. It will also speed-up preparations to purchase asset-backed securities, though that process will likely take many months given regulatory changes needed to make those assets more attractive. Since June 5, ECB officials have fanned out across Europe pleading for patience from financial markets to let the new measures take effect before demanding new stimulus. The ECB has reason to want more time. It's in the middle of a major review of euro-zone bank balance sheets due to be completed in the fall, and is also conducting stress tests to see how banks would withstand economic shocks. The hope is that once these reviews are completed, investors will gain confidence in the region's banks and restore the flow of credit to the private sector. Pressing the pause button also allows the ECB to wait while the Federal Reserve and Bank of England move closer to raising interest rates, which might cheapen the euro and provide a lift to euro-zone growth and inflation. There's a more practical consideration. With its traditional toolkit largely exhausted, the ECB's next stimulus effort would likely have to include large-scale purchases of public and private debt, or quantitative easing. QE is more complicated in the euro zone than in the U.S., U.K. and Japan where it has been used extensively. The euro bloc has 18 national bond markets, making it hard to target such stimulus where it is needed. And the policy is unpopular in Germany, where it stirs fears of a loss of central bank independence. Pressure on the ECB to try QE may intensify this summer if inflation weakens. The International Monetary Fund said recently that the ECB should consider this step. So ECB President Mario Draghi should enjoy his summer break; his in-box may be piled high in the fall. Bank of Japan By Tatsuo Ito So far so good for Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda, 14 months after firing his bazooka of easing measures. He appears to have successfully steered the economy past some challenges early in the year without changing policy course -- though he faces more doubts and difficulties in the next few months. Mr. Kuroda has shown skeptics he can lift inflation and sustain the economy, brushing aside market expectations that the central bank would take extra easing measures to cushion the effects of a sales tax increase in April. Mr. Kuroda expects inflation to dip slightly over the summer as the economy contracts in the second quarter before returning to growth after that. If inflation weakens more than the BOJ expects or flatlines at a lower rate, that will strengthen doubts about whether the bank's giant bond-buying program can drive inflation up to its 2% target--reigniting wider expectations of additional action. Mr. Kuroda continues to take an optimistic line. He has played down the danger presented by the higher sales tax, seen as the biggest challenge for the economic recovery engineered by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mr. Kuroda. Although it's still early to perceive the full impact of the higher tax, it doesn't appear to have badly damaged confidence among households and businesses. Sales figures also indicate that consumption may not be as badly hit as feared. Core consumer prices, meanwhile, rose 1.5% in April after factoring out the sales tax increase. That's a little higher than the BOJ had forecast. The governor's bullish views have drastically reduced market hopes for imminent extra easing, with many economists now pushing out the timing of fresh action from July to October, when the bank releases another price outlook report. Some of them have stopped predicting additional action this year. Mr. Kuroda sees inflation falling to around the 1.25% mark from a bit above it over the coming months before returning to a rising trend by the end of the year. While Mr. Kuroda has repeated a mantra that the economy is on track toward achieving 2% inflation in the fiscal year starting in March 2015, he has also said the BOJ won't hesitate to take action if needed. Should inflation fall below 1%, the consensus is he will readily reach for another round of ammunition. Bank of England By Jason Douglas The Bank of England looks set to be the first among the world's major central banks to call time on years of easy-money policies with a rate rise later this year. The U.K. central bank has kept its benchmark rate pegged at a historic low since March 2009, but an economic growth spurt and tumbling unemployment are eating away at the economic slack that has kept a lid on inflation. 1 Jul 2014 13:28 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, A Second Quarter -2- Gauging just how much slack there is and when to respond is the principal challenge facing the BOE's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. Weak wage growth and subdued inflation suggest there's plenty left; record employment and the fastest pace of growth in the Group of Seven industrialized economies suggest whatever slack is left will be eroded soon. Officials have been at pains to stress that the timing of the first rate increase since a global financial crisis tipped the U.K. into recession in 2008 is less important than the shape of subsequent path of tightening. Officials say rates will rise slowly and are unlikely to rise above 2% or 3% for several years to come. How to deliver on that strategy is increasingly becoming a source of angst on the nine-member MPC. Some officials want to get rate increases started earlier to reduce the risk that faster rises will be needed to contain inflation. Others fret that moving too soon will retard the recovery, particularly since thousands of British households may struggle to cope with higher borrowing costs without stronger income growth. How these competing arguments play out will be critical to the timing of the first hike. The arrival of three new members to the committee this summer will make reading the monetary runes even harder. The BOE faces another problem: a potential housing boom. But officials have said the central bank's Financial Policy Committee, equipped with an array of ""macroprudential"" tools to dampen lending, will be the first line of defense against any worrying build-up in debt People's Bank of China By Bob Davis China's central bank spent a lot of the second quarter fending off what it thought was a very bad idea: cutting interest rates across the board to boost economic growth. Such a move could further inflate China's credit bubble and worsen its housing glut, the Peoples Bank of China argued in interagency sessions, according to Chinese officials. The PBOC carried the day and China has settled for a series of small monetary moves aimed at making more money available to small businesses and farms, which have a tough time getting bank loans. But the central bank's mantra of ""Do No Harm,"" will be tested a lot more in the third quarter. Premier Li Keqiang declared, somewhat surprisingly, in early June that he expected -- almost demanded -- that China hit its declared growth target of 7.5%. With first-quarter growth at 7.4%, year-over-year, China has to rev up its growth engine somehow. And monetary policy is usually the first tool leaders think of, so expect a lot more infighting in the upper reaches of China's government and Party, where the central bank is just one player among many. Unlike other central banks in big economies, the PBOC isn't independent. With the renewed focus on growth, the PBOC's financial reform agenda may take a back seat in the third quarter unless the central bank can convince its superiors that liberalizing interest rates and opening up China to more investment can boost GDP growth. PBOC officials may have a shot at the latter; China's leaders want to attract more money into the country and one way to do it is to let the currency appreciate and approve privately owned banks. Reserve Bank of Australia By James Glynn Australia's central bank has held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 2.5% since August to help contain rising unemployment as a decade-long mining-investment boom cools. The central bank is attempting to rebalance the economy away from its long dependence on mining. But while low rates have helped drive house prices to record highs in major cities, they've had only a modest impact on sectors the central bank is trying to boost--including retail, manufacturing and domestic tourism. Unemployment, at 5.8%, is close to historic highs, and the bank expects the level to remain elevated for much of the next two years. Meanwhile, consumer confidence took a big hit in May after the conservative government released its first budget, which included tax increases and steep spending cuts aimed at reducing the government's budget deficit. Still, some recent data have been more encouraging. Housing construction has begun to see some improvements thanks to low interest rates. Also, the economy grew by 3.5% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the strongest pace in two years. The central bank remains cautious about the outlook, however, believing the mining-investment slowdown will gather momentum as major gas industry projects are completed. Another concern is the rising Australian dollar. This year, it's up by close to 8% against the U.S. dollar, partly as global investors flock to Australia's relatively attractive bond yields. A strong currency hurts the manufacturing and tourism industries the most. Central Bank of Brazil By Paulo Trevisani Brazil's central bank left its benchmark Selic interest rate unchanged at 11% in May, marking the first policy meeting since April 2013 with no rate increase. The bank is battling high inflation amid low economic growth and ahead of a presidential campaign in which the economy is likely to take central stage. The 12-month IPCA consumer-price index is at 6.4% and is forecast to pierce the official targeted range of 2.5% to 6.5%. The central bank says it hasn't given up the mission of bringing inflation down to 4.5%. Some analysts said that the bank stopped raising rates too soon, but the policy makers seem to be now more worried about growth, which is forecast to slow to 1.2% this year from 2.3% in 2013. The central-bank's president, Alexandre Tombini, announced in June that it will extend the currency intervention program it started in 2013 to put a floor under the Brazilian real depreciation. The real is now more stable, mostly trading within a 2.20-to-2.30 per dollar range. But managing the currency has become a tough balancing act, because a strong real could hurt exports and a weak real could feed inflation. The central bank's next policy meeting is July 15-16. Analysts expect the Selic to remain unchanged at least until after the October election, when Mr. Tombini's boss, President Dilma Rousseff, will seek a second term. Bank of Canada By Nirmala Menon A recent uptick in Canadian consumer prices could pose a challenge for the country's central bank, which has underscored concerns about low inflation as a reason to stand-pat on interest rates. Since last October, the Bank of Canada has been in neutral, signaling it was as likely to cut rates as hike them. That marked a significant shift from its long-held stance of leaning more toward possible hikes. Many economists believe the change occurred not only because the central bank was worried about low inflation, but also because it wanted to weaken the Canadian dollar, which would help boost the country's exports by making them cheaper in global markets. Canadian policy makers want exports and business investment to drive the country's growth, given that consumers are strapped with record-high debt levels after years of rock-bottom interest rates. The Bank of Canada's concern over low inflation isn't unusual; other major central banks have also been fretting about slow price increases. Canada's annual inflation rate returned in April to the 2% desired by the central bank for the first time in two years, largely due to energy price increases. The central bank's Gov. Stephen Poloz, however, has continued to highlight downside risks, saying that underlying inflation (which strips out eight volatile components) was probably around 1.2%, which ""leaves us vulnerable to a downside shock of any kind."" The shifting landscape on inflation poses a bit of a dilemma for Mr. Poloz. How can he ease up on low inflation warnings without leading some investors to bet on rate hikes coming sooner rather than later, which would drive up the Canadian dollar and perhaps dampen exports? For now, weak growth and lackluster demand for exports give Mr. Poloz cover to continue flagging worry about low inflation. But if economic growth ramps up ""it's going to shorten the lifespan of that kind of rhetoric,"" Desjardins Capital Markets economic strategist Jimmy Jean said. Czech National Bank By Leos Rousek The Czech National Bank has set the second quarter of 2015 as the earliest possible date for ending its weak-koruna policy, as feeble consumer spending keeps the country's annual rate of inflation just above zero and well below the bank's 2% target. The CNB is likely to leave its benchmark interest rate at near-zero levels for several months after winding down its policy of preventing the currency from strengthening against the euro. A too-strong currency can crimp exports and dampen inflation. ""We will formulate our policy on [rates] only after some time following the exit from the exchange-rate regime, so we're talking about a time horizon well into the future,"" central bank Governor Miroslav Singer said after the late June meeting of the bank's policy board. Analysts expect the bank's headline interest rate to stay at its all-time low of 0.05% at least until early 2016, reflecting the recent pledge by the European Central Bank to maintain an extremely accommodative policy to stoke economic growth in the euro zone. About 80% of the Czech Republic's trade is with companies in Western Europe. ""Recent policy moves by the ECB are complicating (the timing) of any future tightening measures (to be adopted) by the CNB,"" said Prague-based analyst Jaromir Sindel of Citigroup. Amid fears of deflation, the CNB last November began intervening in foreign exchange markets, and has since sold EUR7.4 billion ($10.1 billion) from its reserves to weaken the koruna more than 5% against the euro. ""Our currency commitment remains asymmetric in that we are allowing the koruna to move on the weaker side,"" Mr. Singer said after the June policy meeting. Denmark's Nationalbanken By Charles Duxbury 1 Jul 2014 13:28 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, A Second Quarter -3- Denmark's central bank will keep its eyes trained on the European Central Bank in Frankfurt for policy direction in the months ahead as it seeks to defend the Danish krone's peg to the euro, which is the foundation of Danish monetary policy. After the ECB cut rates in June, the Danish central bank chose not to follow suit, judging that the lower ECB deposit rate would weaken the euro against the krone after a period of euro strength. The Danish central bank defends a EUR/DKK peg of 2.25% on either side of a level of DKK7.46038. Nationalbanken's passive approach seems to have paid off and the ECB rate cut has taken the euro down to DKK7.4549 from a May peak of DKK7.466. Lars Peter Lilleore, an analyst at Danske Bank said it looks like the central bank has successfully let the ECB do the work. ""We expect no autonomous [Danish] action on the short horizon,"" he said. Nationalbanken's deposit rate is 0.05% and its lending rate at 0.2%. National Bank of Hungary By Margit Feher The European Central Bank's recent stimulus measures and commitment to maintain easy-money policies far into the future have given the green light for the Hungarian central bank to keep cutting its main monetary policy rate to levels even lower than earlier expected. Hungary has been cutting interest rates for nearly two years. Many economists expect the National Bank of Hungary to continue with reductions of 0.10 percentage point a month, possibly until the main rate hits 2%, from the current all-time low of 2.3%, down from 7% in August 2012 when its easing campaign began. Headline inflation is at historic lows due largely to government-mandated household energy price cuts, the next of which, a 5.7% household power tariff cut, is due Sept. 1. Unused capacity and weak domestic demand have also dampened inflation. Consumer prices fell 0.1% in May from a year earlier, the first decline since 1968, and are far from the country's 3% medium-term inflation target. With the economy's annual growth rate widely expected to reach 3% this year, inflation is seen likely to accelerate by year-end and meet the target sometime next year. Hungarian central bankers will face the moment of truth when prices start to climb. Morgan Stanley economist Pasquale Diana said he has less confidence in his forecast of 3% for the main policy interest rate at end-2015 ""as we simply have no record of how the current Monetary Policy Council will behave when the rate cycle turns."" Reserve Bank of India By Raymond Zhong A new government took office in India in May, and for the Reserve Bank of India--which isn't an independent central bank and operates in close consultation with the country's finance ministry--the next few months will be defined as much by decisions out of New Delhi as by macroeconomic conditions. The RBI held its policy interest rate steady at 8% after its most recent monetary-policy assessment, in early June. Consumer-price inflation edged down slightly in May, but an 8.3% annual rate is still high. The central bank's aim is 8% by January and 6% a year thereafter. A drier-than-usual rainy season could crimp agricultural production, driving food prices up and causing RBI Gov. Raghuram Rajan to consider raising interest rates further, even amid uncertain GDP growth. Mr. Rajan said recently that ""appropriate management"" of the government's massive reserves of wheat and rice will help keep price rises in check. RBI policy over the next few months will depend on government action in more profound ways, too. Mr. Rajan has endorsed an internal committee's recent recommendation to target consumer-price inflation as the single objective for monetary policy. Other current proposals for reforming the RBI include creating a formal monetary-policy committee that would vote on policy decisions, and potentially relieving the central bank of its responsibility for managing the government's debt. Any of these, if approved by Parliament, would revolutionize the way the RBI does business--and complicate the task for India's new government as it works to revitalize the economy. A more-independent RBI with a mandate for price stability would leave the finance ministry without the ability to bias monetary policy toward lower interest rates to reduce government borrowing costs and pump up GDP growth. Bank of Indonesia By I Made Sentana Clouds are gathering again over Indonesia's economy, meaning monetary policy will likely stay tight for now. Indonesia posted a surprise trade deficit of $2 billion in April, its second worst in five years, in part due to large fuel imports. The central bank is now predicting the current-account deficit will widen through the third quarter from $4.2 billion, or 2.1% of gross domestic product, in the first quarter. The rupiah has fallen 3.5% since April, after gaining 6.7% in the first quarter. There are some positives. Bank Indonesia managed to build up its foreign exchange reserves by $7.6 billion to $107 billion between January and May as foreign portfolio investors brought $11 billion into the country. Inflation eased to 7.32% in May from 8.38% in December. Bank Indonesia officials for now plan to keep monetary policy tight to narrow the current-account deficit. High interest rates are unlikely to be popular with Indonesia's business community and consumers. Economic growth in the first quarter was 5.21% on year, its slowest pace in four years. Many observers say the central government needs to cut costly fuel subsidies, which would slash the country's fuel import bill. But these subsidies, which keep fuel costs for consumers below market prices, are politically sensitive. No change to the subsidies is likely before the presidential election July 9. ""For now, however, the burden fully falls on Bank Indonesia to keep the current account in check through tight monetary policy,"" says OCBC's economist Wellian Wiranto. Bank Indonesia has said it will keep policy rates unchanged until the third quarter. Bank of Israel By Joshua Mitnick The Bank of Israel faces a delicate task: boosting growth prospects and inflation without adding steam to an already frothy housing market. It kept interest rates steady at 0.75% in the second quarter despite expectations by some in the market that Israel's slowing economy would prompt the central bank to carry out a second rate cut this year. ""They basically decided to adopt a wait and see attitude,"" said Jonathan Katz, chief economist at Leader Capital Markets, who said that initial first quarter growth estimates of 2.1% have been revised up to 2.7% and that the picture is ""not all doom and gloom."" Looking to the second half of the year, pressure for a rate cut will mount because inflation is expected to drop below the 1% lower bound of the central bank's target, analysts say. That would have the side benefit of weakening the country's robust currency, the shekel, which has undercut profits among Israel's all-important export sector. That said, the central bank is also concerned about Israel's surging housing prices. Central bank Gov. Karnit Flug came out in recent months against a bill sponsored by Israel's finance minister to eliminate a value-added tax for first-time buyers of new apartments, saying that such a move could boomerang by generating more demand in a market with limited supply. Continued home-price increases may limit the scope for rate cuts. But some analysts believe the main problem underlying Israel's hot property market is a lack of supply -- not easy money. ""On balance, I think the probability is for a cut,"" said Terrence Klingman, an economist at Psagot Investment House. ""That would bring it to a historic low, but I don't know how much more they can cut than that."" Bank of Mexico By Anthony Harrup After surprising markets with a half percentage-point rate cut on June 6 to a record-low 3%, the Bank of Mexico is expected to stay on hold for the rest of the year as inflation remains under control and economic growth picks up. Since taking over the helm at the central bank in 2010, Gov. Agustín Carstens has made efforts to improve the bank's communications with the market. He introduced the publication of minutes from policy meetings, increased guidance, and personally presents all four of the bank's quarterly inflation reports each year, taking questions from the media. And yet, at least three of the bank's four rate cuts under Mr. Carstens--there were three in 2013--have come with little or no warning. The latest rate cuts ""reaffirm a dovish central bank board that is willing to respond to downside risks to growth despite their sole mandate of price stability,"" says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies. ""The rate cuts were also a reminder that Latin America is not hostage to the [Federal Reserve], with less concern about the interest rate differential and the impact on capital flows."" The Fed's wind down of its bond-buying program and the prospect of higher yields in the U.S., were among the main reasons the Bank of Mexico was expected to hold rates, even in the face of sluggish growth in Mexico. The central bank said the cut was most likely a one-time event, but its capacity for surprising markets will keep some from ruling out the possibility of more moves. Probably, said Credit Suisse, the central bank took ""an opportunity it simply couldn't resist"" so that when rates are eventually raised, the bank will be able to stop at a lower level. Reserve Bank of New Zealand By Rebecca Howard New Zealand's central bank raised interest rates in June for the third time in a row, and says more increases are coming. Its aggressive stance is at odds with central banks in other developed nations that still have rates at ultra-low, post-crisis levels. The rationale is the agriculture-rich economy's growing strength, fueled by rising Asian demand for dairy exports and a construction boom following a series of earthquakes that devastated its second-largest city, Christchurch. 1 Jul 2014 13:28 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, A Second Quarter -4- Another driver for the rate hikes is an increase in number of immigrants in the country. The central bank is keen to head off inflationary pressures caused by newcomers purchasing homes and boosting spending in the economy. Inflation is well within the central bank's 1%-3% target band, but it's expecting the pressure to grow. House-price inflation remains a concern, though new curbs on mortgage lending are helping contain it. The latest rate increase brought the benchmark cash-rate target to 3.25%. Though the rises were well flagged, markets were surprised by the central bank's resolve to keep raising rates. New Zealand's economy looks in better shape than those in much of the developed world, where central banks are mostly still grappling with how and when to remove economic stimulus. Reserve Bank Gov. Graeme Wheeler has said the economy is moving forward with ""considerable momentum."" The strength of the New Zealand dollar remains a concern for the central bank, however, since it dents the competitiveness of the nation's exports. The kiwi dollar jumped more than 1.5% after the central bank last forecast more rate rises, underscoring the risks to the export-dependent economy of running too far ahead of the pack with rate increases. Norges Bank By Charles Duxbury Norway's central bank, Norges Bank, took a dovish turn at its last meeting in mid-June, making it clear to investors that it will cut its benchmark rate if needed in the months ahead. ""A further weakening of the outlook for the Norwegian economy may warrant a reduction in the key policy rate,"" Gov. Oystein Olsen said June 19. That message sunk the Norwegian krone against the euro as the prospect of rate rises before the end of next year looks less likely. While Norway's inflation rate is close to the central bank's 2.5% target, the central bank is worried about the effect on the economy of lower borrowing costs abroad and falling oil industry investments at home. The Scandinavian country is rich in oil and gas and its overall fiscal position remains enviable with no net debt and among the highest levels of economic output per capita in the world. But a recent national statistics agency survey of the oil industry forecast that investments there would fall by around 20% next year as costs and uncertainty about government policy rise. National Bank of Poland [check to see if it needs update after meeting Tues/Wed] By Patryk Wasilewski After several months of relative calm, the future path of Poland's monetary policy became a bit of a mystery with contradictory signals from rate setters and questions about Gov. Marek Belka's relationships with fellow policy makers. After its June meeting, the 10-member rate panel surprisingly opened a door to potential rate cuts after a nearly year-long period of being adamant its next decision would be to raise borrowing costs. The officials' earlier confidence was weakened by signs that consumer prices over the summer months may be lower than in the same period last year, amid worrying signals the economy's recovery may be faltering. Decisions by the European Central Bank and Hungarian central bank to ease policies further have also contributed to the reassessment. The annual rate of inflation slowed to 0.2% in May from 0.3% a month earlier, while industrial output rose at an annual rate of 4.4%, down from 5.4% in April. Dovish rate setter Elzbieta Chojna-Duch recently said a cut in the benchmark interest rate, now at an all-time low of 2.5%, might be considered in July. At the other end of the spectrum, hawkish member Andrzej Rzonca believes further easing would destabilize the economy and would require faster tightening later on. The outlook is further muddied by a scandal about a leaked recordings of conversations involving Mr. Belka that have called into question the bank's independence. In the recordings--made by undisclosed people in July 2013--two senior officials are heard discussing a political deal under which the central bank would support the government with bond purchases in the event of any significant market turmoil. Mr. Belka can be heard telling Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz that the bond purchases would be conditional on a change of finance minister. The central bank and the government have acknowledged the authenticity of the recording and the identities of the officials. Mr. Belka has denied attempting to influence the government's personnel policy or promising any support for the governing party. Bank of Russia By Andrey Ostroukh Stubbornly high inflation and a weak ruble make it unlikely that the Bank of Russia will ease monetary policy in the next few months, despite sluggish economic growth. In early 2014, the central bank was expected to gradually cut rates throughout this year, boosting growth. But the Ukraine crisis was a game changer. Western countries adopted sanctions against Moscow after its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. In the first five months of the year, $80 billion in capital fled Russia, more than in the whole of 2013, although the outflow has faded since then. In early March, as the ruble hit all-time lows and pushed inflation higher, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate. That was followed by another rate increase in late April. The central bank left rates unchanged in June, but said it is committed to tightening policy further to reign in annual inflation, which hit 7.7% in June, up from just above 6% at the beginning of the year. The Russian economy is now growing more slowly than at any time since President Vladimir Putin first came to power in 2000, except for during the 2009 global recession Nonetheless, the central bank is sticking to its goal of adopting inflation targeting in 2015, which means it will let the ruble float freely. South African Reserve Bank By Patrick McGroarty Interest-rate increases by South Africa's central bank are a matter of when, not if. And the ""when"" keeps getting pushed further into the future as a worsening economic outlook frustrates the bank's plans to hike interest rates along with some of its emerging-market peers. In January, The bank raised its key rate for the first time in six years to 5.5% during a bout of punishing capital flight from emerging markets. The unexpected move succeeded in drawing investors back. South Africa's bonds and its currency, the rand, rallied. Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus has pledged more rate increases to sustain investors' interest and bring down stubbornly high inflation of around 6%. Many economists expect a hike of at least 25 basis points later this year. ""The interest rate increase in January was not a one-off move,"" Ms. Marcus said in June. ""However, the speed and extent of tightening will be sensitive to domestic growth considerations."" Slowing growth has stalled her plans. Fitch Ratings recently predicted that the economy would grow just 1.7% this year, lower than the already abysmal 1.9% rate in 2013. On June 13 S&P; cut South Africa's foreign and rand-denominated debt ratings by one notch each, to BBB- and BBB+ respectively. Earlier that day, Fitch Ratings cut its outlook for the country to negative. Ms. Marcus says there's not much she can do to reverse these trends. In an unusually frank speech on June 10, she acknowledged that even at a time of unprecedented volatility globally, South Africans only had themselves to blame for their country's dimming economic prospects. ""The domestic economy is facing enormous headwinds, many of which are of our own making,"" she said. Bank of Korea By Kwanwoo Jun In South Korea, many observers expect the central bank to delay raising its benchmark interest rate because of weaker domestic consumption following April's ferry sinking. The Bank of Korea has kept its key policy rate steady at 2.5% for 13 months through June. Many analysts had expected the bank to raise rates soon due to a strengthening economy, forecast to expand 4% this year, up from 3% in 2013, and inflation which is set to accelerate to 2.1% this year versus 1.3% in 2013. But the ferry disaster, which left more than 300 people dead or missing, has traumatized the nation and led to a decline in consumer spending. That might mean the central bank remains on hold for longer than expected, some economists say. Nomura economist Kwon Young-sun says the central bank will likely trim its growth forecast by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points because the disaster suppressed consumer spending. ""This could delay a rate hike, but we do not believe it would be enough to trigger a rate cut,"" he said. Mr. Kwon forecasts a 0.25-percentage-point rate hike in December or early next year. In a poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal, seven of 14 economists expect the BOK to increase the rate in the latter half of this year while five forecast a rate hike in the first half of next year. Sweden's Riksbank By Charles Duxbury Sweden's central bank has long been fighting on two fronts against both low inflation and high and rising household debt. But the battle against low inflation is now the Riksbank's main focus with the consumer price index refusing to rise and criticism mounting about the bank's inability to hit its 2% inflation target. The world's oldest central bank holds its next policy meeting July 2, with a statement on the meeting's outcome due July 3. Many analysts expect Governor Stefan Ingves and his five colleagues on the executive board bank to cut the benchmark interest rate to 0.5% from 0.75%. The bank last cut rates in December, and has been reluctant to do so since. It worries that Swedes, with a high average ratio of household debt to disposable income of 175%, will take lower borrowing costs as a signal to increase their debt burden further. However, the lack of price pressure in Sweden looks set to force the bank's hand in July. Analysts are already speculating that a further cut could well be needed beyond that. Swiss National Bank By Neil MacLucas 1 Jul 2014 13:28 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, A Second Quarter -5- Switzerland's central bank has kept its monetary policy--including interest rates near zero and a cap on the franc-euro exchange rate--steady for almost three years, and that's unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. The Swiss National Bank left policy unchanged for a 12-straight quarter on June 19, following the European Central Bank's decision to impose negative interest rates on banks' deposits with the ECB. The SNB's monetary policy is focused on defending its ceiling of CHF 1.20 per euro. Since the exchange rate has been steady at around 1.2180 since the ECB easing in June, analysts don't expect the SNB to follow its European counterpart in charging banks to hold their funds. ""As long as the euro-franc holds steady around this level the SNB has no need to act, and so negative Swiss deposit rates aren't needed at the moment,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, a currency analyst at Commerzbank. The SNB imposed the franc-euro ceiling in September 2011 to head off the threat of deflation and to help exporters' compete in the euro area markets, which buy around 55% of all goods produced in Switzerland. A higher franc would make Swiss goods more expensive for euro-zone customers. There had been speculation the euro could come under selling pressure versus the franc in the wake of the ECB easing, but the currency market is wary of testing the SNB's resolve to defend the ceiling. The SNB however does have concerns about the boom in the Swiss property market, which is being partly fueled by ultra-low mortgage rates. Since the SNB cannot raise rates for fear of boosting the franc, it will probably stick to its verbal warnings on the dangers of the housing market overheating. Swiss mortgage banks should be in a position to properly assess the credit worthiness of their customers without the intervention of the SNB, according to analysts. Central Bank of The Republic of Turkey By Emre Peker Turkey's central bank is expected to cut interest rates further amid mounting political pressure and despite warnings that premature easing threatens to derail efforts to rebalance the $820 billion economy away from dependence on credit-fueled consumer spending. Governor Erdem Basci surprised markets in June for a second time in as many months with a bigger-than-anticipated reduction to the central bank's benchmark one-week repo rate, lowering it to 8.75% from 9.5%. Policymakers had in May unexpectedly cut the rate from 10%, just as annual inflation hit a two-year high of 9.66%. Price increases have peaked and will decline to 7.6% by yearend, according to the central bank, which has a more optimistic forecast than the 8.3% market consensus. While policymakers in Ankara have reiterated their focus on slowing inflation toward the official 5% target, Mr. Basci said in mid-June that ""measured"" interest rate cuts of 0.25 to 0.75 percentage points remain on the table. The central bank cited ""recent improvement in global liquidity conditions"" in delivering its latest rate cut, which followed dovish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank's rate cuts and expected monetary stimulus, and China's assurances that its economy doesn't face a hard landing. Turkey has been at the center of the ebbs and flows in emerging markets since the start of the year. In January the central bank raised rates aggressively to stem capital flight at the height of turmoil in emerging markets. When the crisis calmed, it was among the first to start reversing those hikes. Regional tensions are another factor, with Islamist militants in neighboring Iraq--Turkey's second-biggest export market--taking dozens of Turks hostage amid broader clashes. The lira has been one of the worst performing emerging market currencies since June 10, slumping by about 3% since jihadists captured Mosul and advanced toward Baghdad. A weakening currency could keep inflation higher than expected, adding to risks that the central bank will once again miss its forecast. Mr. Basci has dismissed charges that the central bank is under pressure to juice growth before the August presidential vote and June 2015 general elections. ""We are also people of this nation, we don't want high interest rates either,"" Mr. Basci said, reiterating that cuts to borrowing costs would follow a slowdown in inflation.

Beijing is a Finalist for the 2022 Winter Olympics. What Are Its Chances? -- WSJ Blog,Norway,"When news arrived in November that Beijing was bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics, many observers in the Chinese capital briefly choked on their tea -- or was that the smog? A few years removed from hosting the Summer Olympics, with virtually no winter sports tradition to speak of and bad air that gets worse when the temperatures drop, China's capital seemed as likely a choice to host the Winter Games as Dubai or Bankok. Eight months later, the International Olympic Committee has named Beijing, which has proposed hosting the games in conjunction with the nearby city of Zhangjiakou, as one of the three finalists for the bid, along with Oslo in Norway and Kazakhstan's Almaty. What are Beijing's chances of actually winning the bid? Better than you might think. The 2022 Winter Olympics has become known as the Olympics no one wants to host after a long list of candidates dropped their bids. Stockholm, Munich, two cities in Switzerland, Denver, Krakow and Lviv in Ukraine all pursued the idea of hosting the event to varying degrees but ultimately decided to withdraw themselves from consideration over the past few months -- leaving only the three finalists. With the exception of Lviv, which cancelled its bid last week because of continuing political strife in Ukraine, most of the other drop-outs appear to have been frightened away by the specter of this year's Winter Games in Sochi, which emptied Russia's coffers to the tune of $51 billion and left little of value behind. Here's China Real Time's rundown of the arguments in favor of and against the remaining candidates: Almaty Pros: Has never hosted an Olympics before, has mountains nearby and claims to have already built many of the necessary facilities. Cons: The city of 1.5 million isn't all that far from Sochi, and ""Borat"" effect notwithstanding, Kazakhstan doesn't top many lists of sexy tourist destinations. The city also may not being willing to lay out the piles of cash required to put on a modern Olympics. (If the city is picked as host, the budget will be ""many, many times"" less than Sochi, a Kazahk Olympic Committee board member told Reuters in February.) Oslo Pros: Is in Europe (which hasn't hosted a Winter Games since Turin in 2006), has the right geography and plenty of oil money, would field a very competitive home team. Cons: Norway has hosted a Winter Olymipics in the relatively recent past (Lillehammer 1994). More importantly, it's not clear the city actually wants to host the games. Various polls put public support for the bid as low as 38%. ""I think the whole thing is crazy,"" one 67-year-old Oslo resident told the Wall Street Journal in September. ""The whole country has to pay for a little pleasure."" Beijing/Zhangjiakou Pros: Lots of money. Cons: As documented by Bloomberg's Adam Minter, the chief argument against Beijing is the city's notoriously chewable air. Zhangjiakou, the city in Hebei where the alpine events would be held, boasts cleaner air, but it still hardly qualifies as pristine and is at its worst in the winter. Besides which, the ""mountains"" of Hebei are pimple-sized when compared with those in previous host locations like Nagano and Salt Lake City. There's also the fact that the 2018 Winter Games are scheduled to be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, which is only 670 miles from Beijing. All that said, it's hard to underestimate the power of a bulging purse -- and if the 2008 Summer Games proved anything, it's that Beijing is willing to spend what it takes to put on an impressive Olympics. Beijing could also dangle the carrot of Zhang Yimou, the famous film director whose authoritarian choreography for the 2008 Olympics opening ceremonies was impressive enough to nab a Peabody award. (Just imagine what he could do with thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers on ice skates.) An announcement on the Beijing government's English news website claimed a 90% support rate for the city's latest Olympic bid. It's not clear how that figure was determined, but if residents are in favor of the idea, it might have to do with secondary benefits promised. The capital's finance bureau has said it plans to invest close to $50 billion yuan ($8 billion) in efforts to reduce fine particulate matter in the air ahead of the games. If that pledge holds, residents of the city could end up winning no matter how the event turns out. Who do you think will ""win"" the right to host the 2022 Winter Games?

Norway's Arctic oil prospects lure explorers,Norway,"There is not a polar bear or iceberg on the horizon, but the Island Innovator drilling rig is well and truly in the Arctic. Sitting just 80km off the northern coast of Norway, the rig is drilling in what many companies hope will be the next big oil region: the Barents Sea. However, oil companies have endured a torrid time in the Arctic. BP and Rosneft, the Russian state oil company, abandoned exploration in 2009 after failing to find significant reserves off the far eastern coast of Russia. Others found oil but decided not to extract it because of high costs - which was BP's reason for not proceeding with a $1.5bn offshore oil project in Alaska in 2012. More recently, Royal Dutch Shell and Cairn Energy squandered $5bn in Alaska and $1bn in Greenland respectively amid technical difficulties and exploration campaigns dogged by protests and legal challenges from environmentalists. But the Barents Sea, situated entirely within the Arctic Circle, is seen as a different prospect. Already, there have been four discoveries including in the Gohta field by Sweden's Lundin Petroleum where the Island Innovator rig is currently drilling an appraisal well. ""We think it's going to be the next area of major growth in Norway. It has both size and romance,"" says Torstein Sannes, Lundin's managing director in Norway. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. < > Standing on the rig, which is rocking only slightly on a placid July day, Lundin's chief executive, British-born Ashley Heppenstall, says the Norwegian Barents Sea is ""completely different"" to other Arctic regions such as Alaska or Greenland due to the lack of ice all year round, at least in the southern part where exploration is taking place. ""Norway has been an extremely successful oil province and I think the next frontier is the Barents Sea,"" he adds. The Arctic has long been hailed as the next big province for oil and gas companies. A 2008 US Geological Survey said the polar region could hold 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered gas and 13 per cent of undiscovered oil. But so far the Arctic has promised more than it has delivered. Even in the Barents Sea, where the first exploration took place 30 years ago, there is still yet to be any oil production, although Italy's Eni plans to change that next year with a NKr45bn ($7.3bn) development of its Goliat field just off the coast near Hammerfest. ""Costs are still well above North Sea and the fact there are limited export possibilities for gas makes developments complex and expensive. The remoteness further adds to the cost picture,"" says Christian Yggeseth, analyst at Arctic Securities. Lundin has so far spent $200m in the Barents Sea on exploration, with a 50-day well costing $65m-$70m. Mr Heppenstall is both optimistic about the broader Barents Sea and cautious about the hopes for the Gohta field, which is estimated to hold 111m-232m barrels of oil equivalent of which up to 141m barrels are oil (the rest is gas). ""It's a very interesting discovery but we don't know if it's a commercial discovery,"" he says. He adds of the Barents Sea as a whole: ""This is really unexplored. This is immature."" But the excitement of companies is palpable. Lundin has 13 licences in the Barents Sea and is drilling two wells this year, with the prospect of at least two more in 2015. Irene Rummelhoff, head of exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf for Statoil, which has drilled 99 of the 109 wells so far in the Barents Sea, says: ""It is the most immature area, hence we also have the largest room for big discoveries. If you are looking for larger volumes, the Barents Sea offers that. But we always have to balance value versus volume, and commercially it's not easy."" Mr Yggeseth notes that of the three waves of exploration of the Barents Sea only the latest has really been fruitful due to improved seismic tests and lessons learned from previous failures. ""I believe there is a large potential going forward as the region matures further,"" he adds. That was shown at the end of June when Statoil, majority owned by the Norwegian government, delayed for the second time its plans for developing the Johan Castberg field, which is estimated to hold 400m-600m barrels of oil and lies to the north of Lundin's Gohta field. Statoil executives insist production is likely to happen but doubts remain about whether to do a floating production solution as Eni is doing at Goliat or a more expensive pipeline. Statoil previously said its plan for an oil hub would cost NKr80bn-90bn but now says the floating solution would be NKr10bn cheaper. Statoil says it wants to talk to other companies operating in the same area but Lundin's Mr Heppenstall says he has had no discussions. Nonetheless, he thinks a pipeline will happen. ""What it means is there would be an immediate export option for any future hydrocarbon discoveries. My personal point of view is that . . . it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when."" The excitement extends away from the part of the Barents Sea Lundin and Statoil are exploring in. Norway is opening up its first new areas for oil exploration in two decades in part of the Barents Sea to the east that was previously disputed between it and Russia. No fewer than 34 companies, including nearly all the oil majors, applied to take part in the seismic tests. The Arctic is crucial not just for the companies but Norway too. Oil production has halved in the past decade. Tord Lien, Norway's oil minister, says: ""In the long term if we want to continue to be an exporter of energy for Europe and the rest of the world then the importance of the Barents Sea will be increasingly larger."" About one in 10 Norwegians live in the north and the oil industry is an important employer in towns such as Hammerfest, Alta and Kirkenes. Marianne Bremnes, mayor of Harstad, where Lundin has its northern base, says: ""Having the oil and gas industry [means] we have more working places and that society is developing in the way we want."" Environmental concerns remain as well as general worries about Norway's high costs. But Lundin, still riding high from making one of the biggest oil discoveries ever in Norway with the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea in 2010, is pushing ahead. ""We have high hopes for the Barents Sea . . . I think where we are operating now is more akin to the North Sea. People think of polar bears or ice but they aren't here. It's a lot darker in winter and lighter in summer and that's it,"" Mr Heppenstall says. Environmentalists push for Norway to leave Arctic oil in the ground Nina Jensen is the sister of Norway's finance minister, who collects the 78 per cent tax on oil production in the country. But Ms Jensen, who is head of the WWF conservation organisation in Norway, is no fan of oil, especially in the Arctic. ""The problem with Arctic oil is we do not have the technology to drill safely in the Arctic. It is one of the areas of the planet that is hit hardest by climate change so it seems illogical to start with fossil fuel development in such an area,"" she says. She points out that much of the Barents Sea had sea ice on it even 30 years ago while it remains an important environment for fish, including halibut and salmon. The oil and gas industry say they take the concerns seriously but point out the areas of the Barents Sea they are exploring in are largely ice-free even in winter. Statoil says it has a comprehensive ice risk programme and it stops drilling if an iceberg comes within 12 hours drifting time of a rig. The Island Innovator rig, drilling Lundin Petroleum's Gohta prospect, complies with the zero discharge policy required in the Norwegian Arctic: no chemicals, toxins or other substances that cause environmental harm are allowed to be emitted by the rig. Ms Jensen and others from environmental groups believe Norway should leave Arctic oil in the ground to help it comply with emission targets. But Tord Lien, the oil minister, says enough is already left in the ground, with recovery rates in the North Sea of 50 per cent of oil at best. ""I believe we have an obligation to continue to produce oil and gas for decades to come,"" he says. ""We need a new vision for the Arctic,"" Ms Jensen says. ""There are a lot of opportunities - tourism, fishing, biomass, renewables - there but we are not exploring them because we are completely blinded by oil and gas."""
Sport scores for Team GB exporters,Norway,"Britain's private companies with the fastest-growing overseas sales show what can be done when you deliver the goods, says Richard Tyler The summer of 2014 is unlikely to be seen as a time of great British sporting achievement, with failures in football, tennis, cricket and rugby. But when it comes to the business side of international sport, Britain's companies are excelling. Be it the engineering behind motorsports, the high-performance clothing demanded by athletes, or the innovative facilities now used to house spectators — 14 companies appearing in the fifth annual Sunday Times HSBC International Track 200 league table are busy behind the scenes. With the World Cup final taking place today in Brazil, London's Arena Group (No58) will be celebrating the construction oftwo9,000 seat stands with its technology at the stadium in Sao Paulo. Six of the sports industry companies are allied to motorsports, such as Hampshire's Formaplex (No111), which engineers parts for Formula One and Le Mans racing teams. Others include Rapha, the cycling clothing firm at No86 that supplies Team Sky with high-performance outfits for the Tour de France, and LGC, the analytical labs firm at No107, that tests for doping in sports. These 14 companies recorded average international sales growth of 41% a year for the last two years, to secure a place in this year's ranking. They outperformed the rest of the table, where the average annual growth was still an outstanding 36%,and ranged from19%to 364%. The 200 firms collectively booked £8.5bn in overseas sales in their latest year, a sizeable proportion of their total sales of £19.8bn. They employ 192,000 people, with No198 — facilities services provider OCS Group — the single largest employer with 70,000 staff worldwide. Engineering is the dominant sector with 41 companies, including the No1 firm Congleton's Tandom Metallurgical, which recycles and trades scrap metal, and Express Engineering (No 52), the Gateshead business that supplies precision machined parts to the oil and gas industry. In total there are 40 companies that feed this industry, such as Aberdeen's electrical equipment supplier Dron & Dickson (No10). The industry's importance to Britain's economy is explored furtherby Ian Stuart ofHSBCon page 3. Scotland is home to almost 40% of these oil and gas related companies, while London boasts 13 of the 14 media firms that feature, and northeast England has four steel-related companies among the 22 from the region appearing in the table. The Midlands and Scotland are home to 21 firms each, southeast England has 25, the northwest has 26, and London houses 62 headquarters. America is the largest single trading partner, with 88 firms citing it as a main market. Over a quarter have subsidiaries in the country, more than double the number in any other. They include digital marketing agency Essence (No 33), which generated half its £141m sales in the US last year. The companies typically cite Australia, Germany, France and China as their next big markets. HSBC's Dan Howlett discusses opportunities in western markets below. Not all the companies require a large office network to prosper overseas, with Stoke-based online bookmaker bet365 (No 90) recording the biggest absolute increase in international sales, up from £505mto£989mbetween 2012 and 2014. Many of the companies trade on their British heritage, including London folding bike manufacturer Brompton Bicycle (No135), Somerset's traditional cheddar cheese maker Barber's (No 141), and Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts, ranked at 149. Sporting success may have been elusive this year, but the International Track 200 companies show what great success business can achieve when clever strategy and smart execution combine awayfrom home. FAST TRACK International Track 200 ranks Britain's private companies by fastest-growing overseas sales. It is produced by Fast Track, the Oxford firm that researches Britain's top-performing private companies and organises invitation-only dinners for their owners and directors to network and meet its sponsors. For full ranking criteria, see page 2. 1 TANDOMMETALLURGICAL Metal processor 364.05% As mining costs have risen in recent years, in tandem with the world's rising consumption of metal, there has been a dramatic change in the way companies source raw materials. Prices have soared — copper alone has more than tripled in value in the last decade. As a result, electronic products made in China now contain upto 80%recycled copper, recovered from old mobile phones, computers and TVs. Recycling metals is a profitable business — which is where Britain's Tandom Metallurgical Group comes in. The Cheshire company was founded in 2008whenmanaging director TomMuir, 57, and commercial director Andrew Lumsden, 48— with nearly 60years of sector experience between them — merged their two recycling companies.The following year they sold a 30% stake in the business to American technology company Chinook Sciences, and used the capital to buy the Congleton premises of one of the largest aluminium ingot producers in Britain. A third of Tandom's £58mturnover is generated from processing metal from scrapped cars into ingots of aluminium, some of which are exported to the continental automotive industry. Last year, the company expanded its Congleton facility and invested£2min new equipment, and can now produce more than 700 tons of alloy a week. The larger part of its business is scrap metal trading — Tandombuys used drinks cans, electronic components and aluminium scrap. It began trading overseas when it bought its Congleton plant, though exports were only £1min 2011whenNick Rose, 43, joined as trading director to drive international sales. Today the majority of exports, which reached £21.9m in 2013, are scrap cables and electronics, shipped to processors in China and India, which extract copper and other metals to sell to local manufacturers. Muir says this mix helps to spread business risk as these sectors are less vulnerable to a downturn than the car industry. China is the world's largest metals recycler and, says Muir,Tandom could easily export 10 times as much scrap to the country as it does currently, if only it could source enough suitable metal. 2 PD&MS; ENERGY Engineering services 246.18% PD&MS; Energy modifies and upgrades offshore oil drilling and production facilities.

Steal a weekend away on Thief Island,Norway,"Travel | SLICE OF THE CITY OSLO Once a haunt of criminals, this regenerated district in Norway's capital has finally gone straight, says Mary Lussiana Oslo's skyline has changed radically in the past five years and so has its footprint, but nothing has brought more to the inhabitants of this oil-rich city, than the district of Tjuvholmen. ""A small town within a city,"" is how property developers Aspelin Ramm and brothers Olav and Frederik Selvaag, describe it - and that is exactly what won the vote on their tender. It's a tapestry of housing and restaurants, art galleries and bakeries, a high-end hotel and a ""starchitect""-designed museum, alongside wide steps to sit on lining the edge of the Oslo Fjord, and there's even a beach to bask on in the short summer months. Tjuvholmen was given its name in the 18th century (it translates as ""Thief Island"") because of its reputation as a place where drunks and thieves lurked and criminals were often taken to be executed. In more recent years, it was still tarnished by this seedy association, even in its later incarnation as part of the city's docks. But with Gothenburg taking over much of the shipping business from Oslo and a growing need for land in the Norwegian capital, Jens Selvaag, an engineer and residential contractor, renowned for his innovative vision, proposed to develop the district. That was in 2001. By 2005, his grandsons, together with Aspelin Ramm and local architect Niels Torp had created a master plan, one which would, Frederik Selvaag told me, ""put Oslo on the contemporary art map"". Fast forward to today: the area was finally completed in January and Selvaag's aim has been more than met. Tourists and locals stream across the bridge to graze and gather, meet and shop, to take in a bit of culture or purchase the latest work from the artist of the moment, all in an ambience that has brought a gloss and a coating of cool to Oslo that was noticeably absent. UNPACK ""Steals you away from everyday life"" is the slogan of the neighbourhood's signature hotel: The Thief (00 47 2400 40 00; thethief.com). This design-focused hotel was created by Mellbye Architects. It glitters with modern art, from Julian Opie's wonderful animated video installations in the lift, where serene women blink at you when you least expect it, to the Andy Warhol which looks down on to your Jerusalem-artichoke-cured leg of lamb. The 119 rooms are warm, in shades of rich brown with glints of gold and granite and views over the Oslo Fjord as befits the city's first waterfront hotel. Together with its new spa, it has redefined Norwegian luxury for the visitor. Doubles start at NOK1,890 (£190), with breakfast. THINK LOCAL Coffee is a national obsession: not home-grown here, of course, but certainly home-roasted. When Starbucks opened its first Norwegian outlet at the airport in 2012, it was reported that crowds took the train out there to try it. However, Bergshaven (00 47 37 04 04 46; bergs haven.com) in Tjuvholmen, wins the local vote. A family firm for more than a century, it relocated to Tjuvholmen and sells Torungen Kaffe, grown in Guatemala, and roasted in a lighthouse in Arendal. It won top prize at this year's national Roaster Championship and brings the capital's cognoscenti to this relaxed café to browse the newspapers and get their caffeine hit of the day. EAT It has to be seafood in Norway and poised right at the water's edge is Sjomagasin (00 47 23 89 77 77; sjoma gasinet.no), a restaurant, shellfish bar and fishmonger's. Choose from the much loved, local blue mussels, steamed with ginger, chilli and garlic; or a whole platter of lobster and the most delicate of shrimps (NOK285/£29). But what you mustn't miss is the seriously good Skagen toast (NOK 185/£19): shrimps, caviar, avocado and dill. It's like the national character - low key - but the combination of fried dark bread under the chunky mayonnaise mix - is unforgettable and like the economy, deliciously rich. DRINK The slickest offering in Tjuvholmen is Hanami (00 47 22 83 10 90; hanami .no), a fusion Japanese restaurant and bar that aims to stand out from the crowd and has, according to manager Jan Kristian, ""collected concept, chef and barman from London's Zuma"". The large bar spills out on to the waterfront on summer evenings, while inside tables are arranged around a brightly lit panel of pink cherry blossom - a reference to Hanami, which is the time when people celebrate the arrival of the blossom in Japan. Fitting then, that its most popular cocktail is a Geisha Martini: a mix of Zubrowka vodka with fresh apple juice, raspberries and passion fruit (NOK139/£14). SPEND It is rare that a living artist has his own gallery, but Oslo native Terje Brofos, who paints under the name of Pushwagner has just that. At Galleri Pushwagner (00 47 22 83 16 18; pushwagner.no) his vivid, vibrant pop art clamours from the white walls and draws you in with its mix of bold blocks and minute details. With his work already hanging in Oslo's National Gallery of Art, Pushwagner is considered one of the greatest contemporary artists working today. ""His dream,"" I was told, ""is to have his own museum one day."" Hand coloured serigraphs and digital graphic artworks cost from around NOK5,000 to NOK 60,000 (£500-£6,000). For more accessible purchases, the cult shop Milla (00 47 22 83 83 66; millaboutique.no) has just relocated to a few minutes' walk away across the bridge in Aker Brygge. Here, sea green marble boxes and bowls jostle with butterflies in glass globes and alphabet rings by Bjorg from NOK 599 (£60). DON'T MISS The jewel in Tjuvholmen's crown is the Renzo Piano designed Astrup Fearnley Museum (00 47 22 93 60 60; afmuseet.no). Its soaring glass roof arcs protectively across separate buildings which house its permanent collection of contemporary art and its temporary exhibitions (currently Elmgreen & Dragset until 24 August). With an emphasis on individual pieces which ""push the boundaries of the artistic canon"", this collection includes works by Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. TRAVEL ESSENTIALS GETTING THERE Fly to Oslo from Heathrow, Gatwick, Aberdeen, Edinburgh or Manchester; Norwegian (0843 3780 888; norwegian.com), SAS (020 8990 7000; flysas.com) and BA (0844 493 0787; ba.com) are the airlines.

DANGER HERE,Norway,"An independent Scotland could pose a real risk to the republic's foreign investment and leave Ulster unionists isolated. Should we be worried, asks Stephen O'Brien Early in last week's television debate with Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, Alistair Darling went on the attack. Britain's former chancellor of the exchequer wanted to talk about currency and to challenge Salmond's six-year-old claim that an independent Scotland could surpass the Celtic tiger's economic success and become the ""Celtic lion"" of international business and trade. Uncertainty about Scotland's link to the pound sterling had helped Darling win the first debate with his opponent in early August, so he pointed across the Irish Sea to what could happen when a government tried to fend off a bank crash without the backing of a big currency and central bank. ""I know from my experience as chancellor of the exchequer, when I had to deal with the collapse of the banking system in 2008, the security that comes from [governing] a country that was large enough to deal with a collapsing bank,"" he said. ""My Irish counterpart, my Icelandic counterpart — remember the 'arc of prosperity'? — they weren't so lucky because they weren't big enough."" The ""arc of prosperity"" was a phrase coined by Salmond in a speech to Harvard University in March 2008, pointing to a group of thriving independent states — Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden — running in an arc around a becalmed Scotland, stuck in the doldrums, its bountiful oil revenues siphoned off to fuel the British exchequer. Tense, shouty and pointing, Darling confronted Salmond with his honeyed words from the past. A relaxed Salmond smiled and grabbed the currency question with both hands, ignoring the Celtic tiger taunt. ""No one can stop us using the pound sterling. It's an internationally tradable currency ... We believe that the best option for Scotland, what I'm seeking a mandate for, is to have the pound sterling,"" he said. The audience at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum broke into a round of sustained applause, the first of several for the Scottish National party (SNP)leader in a debate he won comfortably. After months of trailing in the polls and debates, the momentum in Scotland's independence referendum was suddenly with the Yes side with just three weeks to go before polling. But should Ireland fear or cheer an independent Scotland? Will Salmond's Celtic lion challenge more aggressively for foreign direct investment (FDI)and tourism revenue, and will Ulster unionists be isolated in a lopsided Britain without their Scottish antecedents as political kin? THE government should be contingencyplanning for the consequences of Scottish independence, but the consequences are difficult to predict given the uncertainties around Scotland's currency, membership of the EU and the size of its oil reserves, said Dara Calleary, Fianna Fail's spokesman on enterprise and employment. Scotland already competes with Ireland with a similar tourism product and has a clear lead in valuable niche markets such as golf tourism, Calleary said. While they used be one of our main competitors in terms of FDI, ""they have slipped in recent times"", he added, and our competitors are more the low-cost, high-tech economies of the Far East such as Singapore. ""So much will depend on Scotland's status within the EU,"" said Calleary. ""If they keep the pound and stay out of the eurozone, I don't think there will be any major change. If England leaves the EU after the promised referendum in 2017 and Scotland stays in, they have a huge amount to gain at that stage from that scenario. ""But if Scotland was not an EU country and England were to leave, we would be the major winners in that situation. The kind of investment that could potentially flow into Ireland from London in particular would be quite significant, and that is something our government needs to be contingency-planning for."" The referendum merited a fleeting reference — alongside Britain's possible exit from the EU — in a draft national risk assessment published by the government in April. If the so-called Brexit (British exit) option was taken, ""it could introduce profound uncertainty into Anglo-Irish relations"", the report warned. Similarly, the outcome of the Scottish referendum on independence could introduce ""an element of instability"" into Northern Ireland. ""It wouldn't be lost on us if we had a near neighbour with a similar approach to attracting FDI,"" said a senior government source. ""But we are very confident of our ability in all circumstances — including Scottish independence — to continue to attract more than our share of overseas investment."" At the height of the Celtic tiger, Salmond and the SNP spoke of mimicking Ireland's corporation tax rate. In government on their own, however, they produced a white paper last year — Scotland's Future — promising a gradual move to no more than three points below Britain's 20% corporation tax rate ""to counter the gravitational business pull of London"". ""That would certainly promote tax competition, but I'm not sure Scotland will implement it because it will be very unpopular in the EU, which has already put a lot of pressure on Ireland to harmonise its corporation tax,"" said Michael Keating, politics professor at the University of Aberdeen. ""If Scotland wants to get into the EU as an independent country, it is going to be quite difficult if they are trying to engage in tax competition ... If [the SNP] were to stick to that policy, however, it would pose some real problems for Ireland."" Keating, who will speak at a conference on the Scottish referendum at Dublin's Royal Irish Academy next week, said independence poses other challenges to Ireland, north and south, beyond the fight for foreign investment. Perhaps the least of these is the uncertainty over the British-Irish common travel area, raised when the House of Commons select committee on Scottish affairs suggested Scotland would have to join mainland Europe's borderfree Schengen agreement and leave the British-Irish free travel area. What we would see, said Keating, is a shift towards Euroscepticism in the rest of the UK, not because of losing Scotland's 4m votes but because the south of England would become even more important as the political centre of gravity to the remainder of the nation. ""In Scotland, people are not obsessed about the EU,"" he said. ""In England, you have anti-EU parties — Ukip and the anti-EU wing of the Conservative party — and that pushes the debate towards Euroscepticism, particularly in the south of England."" With Scotland out of Great Britain, Euroscepticism would be magnified as a political point of difference between the main parties. Quite apart from economic concerns, however, is the sense of impending bereavement within the unionist community in Northern Ireland with its historic and cultural connections to western Scotland, in particular. ""One shouldn't underestimate the strength of feeling that there is here and especially within the unionist community about the bonds between Northern Ireland and Scotland within the UK,"" said Jeffrey Donaldson, Democratic Unionist party MPfor Lagan Valley. ""If Scotland were to choose independence, it would be like losing a member of the family in unionist terms."" Donaldson believes the Scots will stay their hand and vote against leaving the union but, if they don't, he says a fascinating chain of events may flow from their independence. ""One of the consequences of Scottish independence would be momentum behind the drive for an English parliament, and I think you would see greater devolution within England itself and to the English regions,"" he said. ""Within a smaller UK, comprising England, Wales and Northern Ireland, over time there would be a reconfiguration of the relationships and the governance. That would potentially mean more devolution to Northern Ireland and to Wales."" Keating sees the concern in the unionist community as something approaching an identity crisis. Northern Ireland was ""another planet"" to most people in the south of England, but there was a historic memory in Scotland of the union with Ireland. ""First of all, what union will Irish unionists belong to after Scottish independence? Ireland, as it then was, joined Britain, as it then was, in 1800. If there is no longer a Britain, what is the union?"" he asked. ""Unionism in Northern Ireland is allegiance to the crown, it is allegiance to the state, it is a kind of Protestant ethnic identity and if one of those comes away — one of the most powerful bits of that heritage which is common to certainly the west of Scotland and the north of Ireland — then what does unionism amount to?"" Ian McKerron of the Yes Scotland campaign group is conscious of unionist sensibilities, but said the issue hadn't featured high in the referendum debate in Scotland. ""We will remain very close friends with people in the other islands that make up this archipelago, that is not going to change,"" he said. DANNY McCOY, director-general of Ibec, a business lobby group, says Ireland would survive the challenge of a newly independent neighbour. Scotland may be geographically closer than the 2004 EU ""accession"" states, but if our FDI flows did not collapse overnight when 10 new countries signed up, they were unlikely to collapse with the arrival of an independent Scotland. ""We can safely move beyond the Scottish independence question and say 'it ain't necessarily so', that it is going to be a disastrous or bad thing for us,"" he said. ""If the remainder of the UK felt it needed to keep Northern Ireland attached, then Northern Ireland will also get a whole slew of devolved powers similar to the Scots, and a 12.5% tax rate for the north could be the most tangible manifestation of that. ""Ibec supports a 12.5% corporation tax rate for the north on the basis that a functioning, successful Northern Ireland will be positive for the whole island; I don't think you will hear a huge sucking sound of all investment going north."" If Ireland can be marketed as a single unit for tourism, why not for investment purposes without the political unification, asks McCoy. If Scotland votes itself out of Britain on September 18, who knows what other tectonic plates may shift. IF SCOTLAND WERE TO CHOOSE INDEPENDENCE, IT WOULD BE LIKE LOSING A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN UNIONIST TERMS"
Innovations draw in the smart money,Norway,"Research into Britain's fastest-growing tech companies shows an ocean of bright ideas is attracting top investors. Richard Tyler reports Makers of lasers, microchips and advanced sensors appear alongside app developers and financial services innovators in this year's ranking of Britain's fastestgrowing private technology companies. The breadth of the activities of the firms that appear in the 14th annualSundayTimesHiscoxTechTrack100suggests that Britain's tech scene is thriving. Some of the companies are exploiting scientific breakthroughs. Among them are Oxfordshire's Cobalt Light Systems (No10), which was spun out from the RutherfordAppletonLaboratory in 2008, andLondon'sApical(No41),whosetechnologyallowsphoneandtablet screens to adjust to light conditions in a similar way to the human eye. Others are taking technology used successfully in one sector and applying it to another, such as EV (No18),which has developed video camera systems that are being used 10,000 metres underground to help explore for oil and gas. With a passing nod to Q branch in James Bond, Liverpool's Marine Specialised Technology (No 89) even makes high-speed assault boats that can submerge and sit at the bottom of the sea to be picked up later. Innovation in financial and mobile technology is another theme running through this year's table. Seven financial technology firms appear, from No1 ranked LMAX Exchange, which has built a foreign exchange trading platform, to peer-to-peer lender Zopa (No 79). Fifteen firmsalsodevelopsoftwareforthemobile world,fromthekeyboardappscreatedby SwiftKey (No 3) to the 25bnads run every month by No 6 ranked MobileWebAdz. Mobile marketing is explored further by Sean Duffy from Barclays on page 2. The companies are growing at a phenomenal rate, on average achieving sales growth of 79% a year for each of the last three years to a total of £2.1bn. They employalmost14,000people—andmore than half generate income overseas, as JulianFrost fromBDOexploresonpage 4. Seventy of the firms are based in London and southeast England.The average chief executive is 45, but the age range runs from 25-year-old Jack Cator, who founded security firm Hide My Ass! (No 9) in his teens, to 70-year-old serial entrepreneur John Cunningham, founder of Northern Ireland's specialist engineer, Camlin Group (No 54). The tech scene is notoriously male but this year 10% of the Tech Track 100 firms are run by women, including Joanne Spector, co-founder of ad software developer Switch Concepts (No 2), Alicia Navarro, founder of Skimlinks (No17), which helps publishers make money online, and Tamara Littleton, founder of socialmediaagencyEmoderation(No65). One striking trend is the resurgence of investment — 18 firms have raised funds in the past 12months,double thenumber in last year's table, and more than 70 funds hold stakes in 38 of the Tech Track 100firms.Three—BusinessGrowthFund (BGF), Index Ventures and Scottish Equity Partners—back three companies eachandJohnEgglestonfromBGFmakes the case for growth capital on page 6. Most of the firms have not featured in the league table before, but travel search engine Skycanner (No 23) and education IT supplier Academia (No 73), are notable exceptions. Both have achieved a place for the fifth year in a row and look destined to join a distinguished group that have done well after featuring in Tech Track 100 in the past, such as property search firm Zoopla, which was valued at £920m when it floated in June, and WolfsonMicroelectronics,acquiredbyan American group last month in a deal that valued the chip maker at £291m. FAST TRACK The Tech Track 100, which ranks Britain's fastest-growing private technology companies by sales, is produced by Fast Track, the Oxfordbased firm that researches Britain's top-performing private companies and organises invitation-only dinners for their owners and directors to network and meet the programme's sponsors. For full ranking criteria, see page 2. 1 LMAX EXCHANGE eFX trading technology 307.80% LMAX Exchange, an electronic trading platformfor foreign exchange, is proving as disruptive to currency trading as its former parent Betfair was when it introduced the exchange concept to the sports betting sector. Before topping trading volumes of $1trillion in 2013, LMAX had experienced a bumpy ride as take-up of exchange trading was slow. Six months after the platform's launch, David Mercer, 43, a former banking executive and currency specialist, joined as chief executive and refocused the business on institutional customers. He then led a £2.4m buyout of the company from its listed parent in 2012, with management taking a 67%stake, while Betfair retained a 33% Like Betfair, LMAX Exchange doesn't risk its own money—it simply matches orders and charges a commission. Orders are visible to everyone and if two orders match, neither party is able to reject or requote a trade—unusual in the often opaque world of foreign exchange. LMAX says its proprietary technology can process up to 400m orders a day with trades taking less than four milliseconds to execute. Clients including fund managers, brokers and individual day traders use the company' s three distinct trading platforms to trade on 70 different currency exchange rates as well as stock market indexes, commodities and precious metals. Last year the company launched a market specifically for trades between banks, with a minimum deal size of $1m (£590,000) and nowcounts more than 20 top-tier banks as clients. Mercer expects that in the future the bank platformwill account for up to half of the company's revenues—which represent commission—and LMAX expects to make a profit for the first time this year. ""Attracting and retaining large bank clients is one factor behind the company's phenomenal growth in revenue from £271,000 in 2010 to an annualised £18.4m in 2013,"" he said. 2 SWITCH CONCEPTS Advertising software developer 262.92% This company's software powers the auctioning of online advertisements.

How much North Sea oil revenue can an independent Scotland extract?,Norway,"The SNP stresses the economic importance of oil and gas but experts aren't sure how much is out there or how much it's worth The Scottish economy has grown on the back of whisky, tourism and financial services but by far the biggest potential money-spinner comes from resources still in the ground: oil. The North Sea has always been seen as crucial, not only to employment and tax revenues, but to the whole viability of Scotland as a thriving and independent nation state. It is not alone. Countries from Russia to Venezuela and as close as Norway have relied on oil and gas to create wealth to fund public spending programmes. Greenland is desperately trying to encourage companies to drill in the Arctic. Why? Because it recognises it cannot rid itself of its political master, Denmark, without economic independence. And that cannot be built on seal skins. Equally you have got to sell a lot of whisky to match the 866,000 barrels of oil a day – at more than $100 a barrel – produced from the UK North Sea in 2013, never mind the 36bn cubic metres of gas on top of that. Most of that cash will go to the companies involved in the extraction but the tax take on these hydrocarbon riches goes at present to the Treasury in London to the tune of £4.7bn in 2013-14 and more than £6bn for the 12 months earlier. It is assumed on both sides of the border that 91% of those tax revenues could be taken by Scotland on the basis of an internationally accepted median line drawn out between Scotland and England straight out into the sea. Alex Salmond, a former oil economist and now first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish Nationalist party, has argued that a newly independent country could exploit the £54bn in tax taken from the North Sea in the six years up to 2016-17. And he believes that there are 24bn barrels of oil equivalents (boe) of reserves – which includes gas – still lying under the seabed and waiting to be exploited. Based on that number, Salmond has argued that there is £1.5tn worth of fuel to help create jobs, boost tax returns and add benefits for the people of Scotland. Such figures have proved a major bone of contention. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has predicted recoverable reserves of 10bn boe and North Sea tax revenues of £61.6bn between now and 2040. The Office for National Statistics put the worth of untapped reserves to the UK Treasury at closer to £120bn while Sir Ian Wood, a leading offshore oil industrialist in Aberdeen, put the figure at 15bn-16.5bn barrels. Why the variation? A letter to explain the £61.6bn figure used by the OBR written by the chairman, Robert Chote, to the Scottish parliament explained ""Oil and gas receipts are one of the most volatile streams of revenue coming into the exchequer, which also makes them one of the most difficult to forecast. This reflects the number and the nature of the factors that determine these revenues: the levels of oil and gas production, global dollar prices, the sterling/dollar exchange rate, the scale of tax-deductible capital and operating expenditure, and the history of past profits and losses for each company in the industry that determine if and when they will pay tax on newly generated profits. Most of these individual determinants are difficult to predict in their own right, even over a very short time horizon."" Others go further, pointing out that to reach the 24bn figure the SNP is using ""proven, probable and possible reserves ... as well as further exploration"". The party has also admitted that its £1.5tn figure is dependent on oil prices staying above $100. Most industry experts would expect that but it cannot be guaranteed. The reserve figure described by Salmond as ""robust"" is much more controversial. John Busby, an independent energy consultant, argues that the barrel of oil equivalent numbers used by the SNP and others are largely meaningless. ""The only value is really attached to recoverable reserves – oil or gas that can definitely be got out economically. Those are the only numbers that are recognised [when assessing oil company values] by the securities and exchange commission in the US."" He points out that BP, in its respected annual statistical review of the global industry, puts the amount of recoverable reserves in Britain at 3bn barrels and says the fast rundown of oil and gas output suggests there is an energy and fiscal problem looming whoever owns the hydrocarbons. Not discussed here but highlighted by the Guardian in the past is the fact that there are almost no truly indigenous oil or gas exploration and development companies in Scotland. Does this matter? Some would say that the big – nominally – local companies such as BP and Shell have reduced their North Sea activities hugely over the last decade without any dramatic impact on the UK; oil money is highly mobile and the same companies that invest in the UK – or Scotland – are happy to work anywhere. And will. If the tax regime is more attractive in a new up-and-coming area such as, say, Mexico – as opposed to a mature North Sea field where big finds are now deemed unlikely – then they are likely to switch investment there. Small countries dependent on oil find it difficult to negotiate with massive international oil companies. Salmond must know an independent Scotland would have to give more lucrative tax treatment to Big Oil if he is going to encourage them to extract the 3bn barrels highlighted by BP or the 24bn that the first minister hopes for. Oil & Gas UK, the industry lobby group, said last month: ""We are clear that fundamental change is needed to change the way the industry is taxed and regulated, if the UK is to maximise economic recovery from the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS)."" The cost of operations has soared in recent years and drilling is currently at very low levels, with estimates that the North Sea could produce less than 800,000 barrels this year compared to the near 3m in 1999. In the background lurks the row over whether or not any country should be drilling out reserves at all just as we need to move away from fossil fuels towards a low-carbon economy. There is increasing talk by organisations with pension funds to divest from sectors which cause global warming in the light of a wider debate about ""stranded assets"" . Salmond has rightly talked up the prospects of Scotland's windfarms and green economy but a much deeper prosperity based heavily on oil cannot be guaranteed by anyone. It depends on a range of factors; many not under his control. guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2014"
Businesses sound alarm over fallout from Scottish ‘Yes' vote,Norway,"Scotland's vote over separation from the United Kingdom has raised the ire of multinationals with headquarters in the region, while Canadian companies wait and watch from the sidelines. Britain was tossed into tumult by plans for the Scottish referendum, scheduled for Sept. 18, with financial firms, energy leaders and even retailers saying the change would negatively affect their businesses. Some pledged to move their headquarters if voters say ‘aye' to separation. Five banks have declared intentions to move their registered offices to England should Scotland separate and are preparing for that possibility. British heavyweight Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, with a 287-year history in Scotland, said the possible impact on credit ratings and the legal and regulatory landscape would be reasons to relocate its official headquarters. The bank said it would mean no changes for retail customers. Other banks developing contingency plans for a “yes"" vote include Tesco Bank, Lloyds Banking Group PLC, TSB Bank PLC and National Australia Bank's Scottish lender Clydesdale Bank. A variety of retailers have also told British media that the cost of goods could rise in an independent Scotland. Some of the loudest objections have come from major energy companies that operate in the North Sea, where the nearly 50year-old oil industry is maturing. British oil giant BP PLC said opportunities in the region are becoming “smaller and more challenging,"" adding that with mounting costs from managing and decommissioning mature oil assets, BP needs stability. “As a major investor in Scotland – now and into the future – BP believes that the future prospects for the North Sea are best served by maintaining the existing capacity and integrity of the United Kingdom,"" said Bob Dudley, group chief executive, in a statement. Canadian companies located in Scotland contribute about 5,000 jobs to the region, many of them in the oil and gas industry. Firms from Canada based near the coastal city of Aberdeen are responsible for about 30 per cent of the oil and gas produced in the North Sea, according to investment advocacy group Scottish Development International (SDI). Calgary-based Talisman Energy Inc., a big offshore oil operator in the North Sea, said it was not taking a position on the referendum issue and had no comment. The company reduced its stake in the region in 2012 to focus on projects in more lucrative areas, selling 49 per cent of its Aberdeen-based energy business to Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Co. for $1.5-billion (U.S.). Energy services company ShawCor Ltd. has interests in Scotland, but said it does not have a position on the Scottish independence vote. “Any impact on our company would depend on whether changes in political arrangements between Scotland and the U.K. impacted the future level of investment in offshore oil and gas production,"" said Gary Love, chief financial officer at ShawCor. “At this time, it would be highly speculative to try to forecast any such changes in future oil and gas investment."" Richmond, B.C.-headquartered CHC Helicopter Corp., has been operating flight services to energy companies the North Sea's deepwater offshore oil and gas industry from the Scottish and Norwegian coasts for decades. The company is watching the vote, but thinks the importance of the industry to local economies protects it somewhat. “Oil and gas is so important that the expectation is that all the work in support of it continues whichever way the referendum plays out,"" said T.R. Reid, CHC vice-president of communications. “As long as that's the case, and there are still people who need to get to the installations and back, we'll continue to fly."" Roughly 50 Canadian companies operate or have some representation in Scotland, based on SDI's assessment. One of this country's largest contributions to the Scottish economy, according to SDI, is the $107.2-million that 100,000 Canadian tourists spend there in an average year."
Scotland's Risky Bet,Norway,"LONDON -- Scottish nationalists have long argued that being governed from London has deprived their country of its fair share of the wealth from Britain's oil and natural gas fields, which mostly lie in North Sea waters off their shores. ''It's Scotland's oil'' was the rallying cry in the 1970s that helped raise the profile of the Scottish Nationalist Party, which now leads the country and is pushing for a vote to secede in the referendum on Thursday. Alex Salmond, the politician leading the separatist movement, has pointed to North Sea energy as the treasure that would help finance an independent Scotland -- ensuring that the country could continue the generous public spending, including free university tuition, that he is promising voters. But North Sea energy revenue -- even if the bulk of it went to a stand-alone Scotland, as is expected -- would not be sufficient to justify such a big bet on the country's economic future. The approximately 5 billion pounds, or $8 billion, that the British government received in tax revenue from North Sea energy last year would have been the equivalent of only about 3 percent of the Scottish economy. Scotland has many other industries working in its favor, including banking and financial services, textiles, whisky and tourism. They would continue to play their parts, although the big banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, have both indicated that they would move their headquarters to England if Scotland secedes, and some other multinationals might be harboring similar thoughts. While the oil and natural gas industry, and its 225,000 or so Scottish jobs, would remain vital to Scotland for years, the North Sea is no longer the bonanza it once was. Oil and gas production has declined by about two-thirds from the peak of 4.6 million barrels a day in the late 1990s, and tax revenue is declining and too erratic to count on, industry experts say. Even though some big oil companies have begun venturing farther offshore into deeper waters north of Scotland, the industry opposes the independence movement and might think twice before making the billions of dollars of investments required to bring that oil and gas to the surface. The ever-fluctuating price of oil makes any planning by industry executives, not to mention government treasurers, highly uncertain. Perhaps the harshest reality check on Mr. Salmond's forecasts has come from Ian Wood, a Scotsman who is the retired founder of Wood Group, a global oil services company based in Aberdeen. He is a widely respected figure in the industry whose work has been used for years by the British and Scottish governments. ''Young people voting this week must be aware that by the time they're in their 40s, Scotland will have little offshore oil and gas production, and this will severely hit our economy, jobs and public services,'' Mr. Wood wrote on Energy Voice, an industry website. ''I have been shocked by the amount of misinformation and spin.'' Even in Aberdeen, the former fishing port in northern Scotland that has become one of the wealthiest areas in Britain thanks to its role as gateway to the North Sea, there is an undertone of worry. Oil executives say that production costs have risen sharply because aging platforms and equipment require more frequent and extensive maintenance. Some oil and natural gas fields, they say, are now so depleted and their equipment so dilapidated that they cost more to operate than they generate in revenue. Some operators, including Chevron, have announced staff cuts in Aberdeen, a rarity in that energy-boom city. Last year, Chevron put under review its most prominent British development -- an estimated $10 billion project northwest of Scotland called Rosebank -- because of costs. ''This is a vulnerable industry,'' Barney Crockett, a Labour Party member of the Aberdeen City Council, said in an interview. The government that winds up in charge of Britain's oil and natural gas will face the task of giving tax incentives and finding other ways to squeeze the remaining oil and gas out of fields that are increasingly expensive to develop, analysts say. ''The opportunities are smaller and more challenging to develop than in the past,'' Robert W. Dudley, chief executive of the oil giant BP, the second-largest investor in British waters after Royal Dutch Shell, said in a statement last week urging a no vote. ''Future long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty.'' There are two main, diverging views on what Scottish victory would mean for the industry. One is that the Scottish government might pay closer attention, given energy's economic importance to the country. The other view, perhaps the majority one, holds that a period of uncertainty could hamper the industry since the North Sea is already at a crossroad. If Scotland does vote yes, there would be at least 18 months of transition before the country would be fully autonomous. ''The larger players want things cleared up before proceeding,'' said Alex Martinos, an analyst in London with Energy Intelligence, a research firm. There are also doubts about whether a stand-alone Scottish government could afford to give the energy industry the new tax incentives that might be needed to continue production in the North Sea. About 40 billion barrels of oil and gas have been produced from the area since the 1970s. That leaves an estimated 12 billion to 24 billion barrels more, still a sizable amount -- but it will be increasingly difficult and costly to extract. Mr. Salmond's government says it has no plans to increase the tax burden on the oil industry. But whether it could afford to cut taxes is another question. Even with better management, oil and gas production is likely to tail off to around a couple of hundred thousand barrels a day by 2050, down from about 1.5 million barrels day now, according to Alexander G. Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen. Fortunately for the Scottish government, 2050 is a long way off -- and the immediate future looks better. Thanks to recent heavy industry investments, Mr. Kemp and others foresee production picking up in the next few years. As a result, the Scottish government is assuming that energy-related tax revenue will recover to the annual range of £6 billion to £8 billion. But those estimates assume oil prices of $110 a barrel. That could prove too optimistic, as expanding energy production in the United States is putting downward pressure on world prices. Oil prices are hovering around $100 a barrel. Further weighing on the prospects, the industry's cost of retiring depleted fields and decommissioning old oil platforms is likely to rise, crimping tax receipts. The British government has guaranteed tax relief on these costs. Wood Mackenzie, an Edinburgh research firm, estimates that Scottish fields will cost $9 billion in cumulative tax relief by 2030. There is little doubt that managing this decline is going to be the main job of whatever government is in charge. The British government, which has long been something of an absentee landlord for the North Sea, has been spurred to action by the referendum's threat. Mr. Wood, the oil services expert, recommended this year in a report commissioned by the government of Prime Minister David Cameron that the government establish a powerful new regulator, separate from the bureaucratic Department of Energy and Climate Change, and that it provide incentives, like one in Norway that allows small companies to quickly recover cash for their exploration expenses. The Cameron government has said it would act on these proposals. Whether it gets the chance to fulfill that promise will depend on Thursday's vote."
Day for Night in Norway,Norway,"Corrections Appended The Hurtigruten website[http://www.hurtigrutencruiseline.com/] modestly describes its cruise up the Norwegian coast as “the world’s most beautiful voyage.” When I read this, I could not help but think of that old Monty Python skit in which a man writes the world’s funniest joke — a joke so funny that everyone who reads it instantly dies from laughter. I wondered if beauty, pressed toward hyperbole, could become similarly perilous. Would the decks of the ship be littered with tourists smitten by the sublime? We were about to find out. I was standing on the top deck of the nine-deck MS Trollfjord with my wife, Katie, and 6-month-old son, Holt. On the quay far below us, my Norwegian relatives were maniacally waving at the boat, though not at where we were standing on the ferry. I had just spent the last day running around Trondheim — a lovable, wharf-laden university town perched on the lip of a fjord — trying to track down my grandfather’s old house, with mixed success. It seemed he had lived in several different houses, or maybe no house at all. I, like many Americans before me, had dragged my family to Norway[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/norway/overview.html?inline=nyt-geo] for mysterious reasons. I was only technically one-quarter Norwegian, though yearned for much more. My heart swelled every time Norwegians mistakenly addressed me in their native tongue even when I would have to sheepishly reply in English. I both relished and hated my role as an impostor. I also fancied myself a kind of amateur anthropologist. The previous night around 10 p.m., as the sun showed no real intention of setting, my cousin Coleman had asked if we wanted to go on an “afternoon” walk. Such is the casual relationship that people seemed to maintain with time at northern latitudes, where in winter the daylight shrinks to a couple of hours and in the summer the night never quite grows dark. Above the Arctic Circle, this binary existence becomes even more extreme, to the point where the entire year becomes a kind of single, interminable day, with six months of light and six months of night. I wanted to go as far north as I could and see for myself how people managed to survive such a dualistic relationship with the sun without going at least some kind of crazy. My relatives had finally located us on the top deck. I tried to match the enthusiasm of their waves. The breeze had freshened against our faces; a hovering gull eyed us skeptically. I could feel that very particular tingle that one feels just before departing for uncertain territory. With a long blast from the ship’s horn, we pulled out into the fjord and headed north. I watched as the mint-colored steeple of Trondheim’s cathedral slipped from view, replaced by layered mountains of pine that swept down to the water’s edge, forming a narrow channel to the sea. Hurtigruten literally means “the express route,” and while there is nothing “express” about it these days, back when it was founded in 1893, the ferry line was nothing short of a revelation, delivering mail and cargo and passengers to northern communities that were otherwise completely isolated from the rest of the world. By combining navigational prowess, humble practicality and stunning natural beauty, the Hurtigruten has become one of Norway’s treasured national symbols. My grandfather took my father on this same route 50 years ago. Yet the Hurtigruten of 2014 bears little resemblance to the Hurtigruten of old. Over time, the original service mission of the coastal express became largely redundant as mail, cargo and passengers turned increasingly to the convenience of air transport, forcing the company to look toward tourism for its primary source of revenue. Its transition from a utilitarian coastal ferry to an all-out cruise line has caused more than a few growing pains. Built in 2002, our ship, the 445-foot MS Trollfjord, was representative of this new Hurtigruten. As Holt and I excitedly explored the ship’s decks, what quickly became apparent was that we were witnessing a company in the midst of a mild identity crisis. Our hosts were trying to simultaneously indulge the desires of the increasingly discerning modern cruise passenger while also maintaining the understated modesty of Norwegian culture. Thus, the MS Trollfjord featured two small Jacuzzis on Deck 9, complete with multicolored party lights, but these closed promptly at 11 p.m. There was no swimming pool or water slide or mini-golf course. Deck 8 featured an abandoned dance floor that nonetheless piped out soft ’80s ballads 24 hours a day, as elderly couples sat nearby sipping Scotch and playing bridge. One night around 1 a.m., insomniac and alone, I couldn’t resist dancing solo to “Life Is a Highway,” as I stared out at a distant smattering of islands silhouetted like beached whales against a sky that had forgotten to turn dark. Part of the issue here was the crowd. The passengers were 80 to 90 percent German retirees, a high percentage of whom sported fanny packs and matching Jack Wolfskin parkas. Needless to say, these people had not come to Norway to dance. Much of our fellow passengers’ focus was concentrated on the various off-boat excursions offered each day. This was a relatively recent addition to the Hurtigruten package, and clearly an attempt to placate the demands of the modern cruise tourist. On any given day you could go dog sledding, hang out with sea eagles or eat a meal with a man dressed as a Viking. There were also near constant P.A. announcements in Norwegian, German and English about the excursions. When I later met Esklid Arne Ognes, who broadcast these announcements, I felt a bit as if I were meeting the voice of God. People act in peculiar ways when forced to live together in confined places. This is particularly true on sightseeing cruises like the Hurtigruten, where landscape is transformed into a kind of currency. By boarding a ship that declares itself “the world’s most beautiful voyage,” passengers maintain an expectation of transcendent topographic voyeurism and this was encouraged by the ship’s layout: almost all chairs faced outward. Such an arrangement did not inspire community or group engagement. People could get territorial about their sightlines. Seats in the very front of the panorama lounge on Decks 8 and 9 were always occupied, and if someone abandoned a post (gasp), a keen lingerer would quickly take up the position. The view, admittedly, was fantastic. If you have never been to Norway, you must understand it is blessed with an overabundance of staggering landscapes. Glaciers tend to leave dramatic geology in their wake, and Norway is no exception: Soaring granite mountains drop straight down into the sea; waterfalls plunge 300 feet through scree fields and terraced alpine meadows; everywhere you look there are clusters of rocky islands and impossibly cute red farmhouses poised on the crook of some bluff. Think coast of Maine meets Yosemite meets Tolkien. After a day or two navigating these panoramas, one becomes so desensitized to the utter stunningness of it all that you begin to take just another spectacular sea-and-mountain vista for granted, even if this same vista in the United States would instantly become a national park. Despite being only 150,000 square miles (about the size of Montana), the country boasts one of the most undulatory coastlines in the world, measuring an astonishing 64,000 miles long[http://blog.norway.com/2011/12/02/norway-is-longer-than-you-think/]. (By comparison the entire coast of the United States is 95,471, a[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/shorelength.html]ccording to the National Ocean Service.) Unsurprisingly, the Norwegian coastline is essential to the country’s identity — and not just because of the country’s primary industries of fishing and offshore drilling. A line of skerries — essentially small, uninhabited rocky reefs — creates a naturally protected coastal passage all the way to the North Cape and gives rise to the country’s name: Nor-way means “the way north” in Old Norse. Studying Norway’s ragged coast, with its hundreds of thousands of islands, is like studying the country’s metaphorical DNA: It is unique; it is unendingly complex; it is the fingerprint of a nation. But what’s fascinating is that the view from the Hurtigruten’s panorama lounges is also very slow. As in: very, very slow. Despite once upon a time being billed as the “coastal express,” the Hurtigruten actually travels at a maximum speed of around 15 knots, which is about the speed of a brisk bicycle ride. So you really have time to linger on every skerry, every shoal, every little red farmhouse. This protracted (and mediated) narrative pace mirrors a baffling trend taking place in Norwegian television called Slow TV. In 2009, the public television station NRK broadcast a six-hour, 22-minute uninterrupted train trip from Bergen to Oslo by mounting a camera on the front of the locomotive. NRK had modest expectations for viewership, but the show became an overnight sensation — approximately 20 percent of all Norwegians tuned in to the train ride at some point. One 76-year-old viewer, upon arrival of the train in Oslo, forgot that he was not actually a passenger himself, and when he got up to fetch his overhead luggage he crashed into his living room curtains. NRK followed this up two years later with an even slower program, “Hurtigruten Minute for Minute,” in which the entire 134-hour coastal journey was broadcast live. After a relatively subdued departure from Bergen, the show began to steadily gather viewers, such that by the third or fourth day, entire towns were coming out to greet the camera. People dressed up in ridiculous Norwegian costumes; marching bands serenaded the boat’s arrival and departures; one opportunistic local politician announced her candidacy on the show by unfurling a giant banner across the quay. The last day of the trip the queen of Norway even waved to the ship from her royal yacht. The program became a bona fide national event — half the country watched the voyage at some point. I made a habit of asking almost every Norwegian I met why they thought Slow TV was so popular in Norway. Most of them gave me highly unsatisfactory answers — they said that Norwegians were simply “patriotic” or that they found the shows “relaxing.” I explained to them that many people were patriotic or wanted to relax, but this did not mean they would sit down and watch a train for six hours. I began to develop a more robust hypothesis about what attracted Norwegians in particular to Slow TV after speaking with Sverre Andreas Rud, the MS Trollfjord’s first officer. He was showing me around the ship’s impressive bridge, demonstrating how the boat’s giant twin propellers could rotate 360 degrees and turn the boat on a dime, which is convenient for some of the smaller harbors. We got to talking about how much Norway has changed in the last 20 years, a sentiment echoed by many of those I talked to. Officially founded in 1905 after finally ridding itself of Swedish rule, Norway is the youngest of the Scandinavian nations and still suffers from what one might call youngest child syndrome. But then oil reserves were discovered off Norway’s coast in 1969, and everything changed. The youngest child had suddenly become rich. One of the byproducts of this sudden influx of capital has been an intensive modernization in nearly all sectors of Norwegian life. Just 20 years ago, Oslo was a sleepy, provincial town known mainly for annually handing out the Nobel Peace Prize. Today, it is Europe’s fastest growing capital. Everywhere you look, skyscrapers are being hastily erected, including a controversial sequence of five metal and glass buildings disparagingly called the “bar code.” As income and consumerism have increased, the pace of life has also accelerated dramatically. In trying to adjust to such rapid change in a relatively short amount of time, many Norwegians seem to be suffering from a kind of cultural whiplash, leaving them apprehensive for the future and nostalgic for a past that was barely the past. When I asked him about his thoughts on Slow TV’s popularity, Mr. Rud became reflective. “Maybe it’s a way for people to get back to the way things were not so long ago,” he said. “To remember what it was like.” “What was it like?” I asked. “I’m not sure,” he said. “Slower.” The more I thought about this, the more sense it made, as even Norwegians in their 30s would grow nostalgic about their youth using the same kind of hyperbole normally reserved for people in their 80s. It seemed particularly appropriate that this mode of nostalgia, while directed at a mythical pace of life that perhaps never quite existed, does so via an entirely modern medium. The live Twitter feedback that NRK receives over the course of a program (which the station claims affects its content and editing choices in real time) feels like new media recreating old forms of storytelling: Norwegians gather around the virtual campfire to hear wistful tales from the old frontier. Of course, Norway, with only five million people, is still small enough (and homogeneous enough) to allow a story or program to become a national event. When I visited the country a couple of years ago, all anyone could talk about was Karl Ove Knausgaard’s 1,600-page autobiographical novel “My Struggle,” the first two volumes of which had just been published. Never in my life had I seen a culture so captured by a piece of literature. And “My Struggle” is perhaps the ultimate form of slow storytelling — it is a celebration of the exquisite beauty of the mundane, in which Mr. Knausgaard recounts his life’s minutiae. Just like Slow TV, Mr. Knausgaard manages to reinvent narrative stakes by pushing past the point when we feel the camera should cut away or the writer should put down his pen. He dares us to keep reading, to keep watching, and in doing so we become complicit in a mutual humanness — we are all this ordinary, and isn’t that extraordinary. We disembarked and bid adieu to the MS Trollfjord at the village of Stamsund, on the southern coast of the Lofoten Archipelago, which extends out into the Norwegian Sea like a lazy finger. Lofoten is famous for its scenery, and in a country blessed with a bounty of scenery, this is really saying something. The island chain features a wall of soaring, granite peaks running down its spine. In the summer, the rock faces of these mountains are brushed with a soft palette of green scrub and lichen; from a distance, the islands appear to be floating above the surface of the sea. Even though it lies 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle, Lofoten, like the rest of Norway, remains relatively temperate due primarily to the Gulf Stream flowing up from Florida. Every Norwegian should write an annual love letter to the Gulf Stream. The warm currents keep harbors from freezing in the winter, provide bountiful fishing grounds and moderate sea and land temperatures all year round. From Stamsund we drove out to Moskenes Island, at the very tip of the finger. The drive, across a series of 16 bridges, was jaw-dropping and also nose-wrinkling, especially when we passed by one of the many racks of cod being air-dried into stockfish, a popular dish in Italy, Spain and Nigeria. Cod fishing used to be Lofoten’s main industry but industrial boats, offshore processing and corporate consolidation have caused entire villages to disappear. We stayed in the village of Reine, at Reine Rorbuer, which lies on a beautiful little nugget of a peninsula bordered on three sides by towering Middle Earth mountains. The rorbuer, or fisherman’s cabin, is the classic accommodation in Lofoten, particularly because so many of them are unused these days. Our cabin, painted in immaculate Norwegian red, sat on stilts and overlooked a sleepy little harbor of puttering fishing boats. Drained from taking in so much landscape, we settled down for a dinner at the cute Gammelbua[http://www.lofoten-info.no/reinerorbuer/gammelbu.htm] restaurant and sampled whale steak, which tasted a bit like overcooked entrecôte, and cod fish tongues, a local delicacy, which tasted divine. We eventually climbed into bed around midnight, though such a choice seemed merely happenstance, since the light was still streaming through the windows. The next day, we headed back to Stamsund to catch our new boat, the MS Kong Harald. If the Trollfjord was the Bellagio of Hurtigrutens, then the Kong Harald was the El Cortez in downtown Vegas. Built in 1993, it had a lovely element of ’80s kitsch — inappropriate brass columns, faux leather couches, heavy carpeting, a ceiling that was a couple of inches too low. It felt a bit as though Barry Manilow might show up at any minute and warble out a couple of numbers. And I mean this as a compliment — I actually preferred the Kong Harald’s décor to the clean, cool modernity of the Trollfjord. The Kong was a decisive step back toward Hurtigruten’s workmanlike roots. The crowd had also changed. Gone were the parka-clad Germans, replaced by a boisterous French charter group. God now spoke in Norwegian, French and English. There was a palpable liveliness in the air. This French crowd was also remarkably aggressive. When the ship squeezed through the Trollfjord — a narrow fjord buttressed by soaring cliffs on either side — the value of landscape currency skyrocketed. Elbows were thrown; grown men could be seen sprinting from one side of the boat to the other brandishing their telephoto lenses; several children were knocked down in the mayhem. On our last night on the Kong, as we rounded the very north of Norway and brushed against the rolls of the Barents Sea, we finally decided to spring for the seated dinner, since it was a lavish seafood buffet appropriately named “The End of the World.” We had not sat down to a proper dinner yet in the dining hall. Unlike most passengers, who had purchased full board, we had bought a basic ticket that included only our cabin and breakfast. I would be remiss, at this point, not to mention the prices in Norway. Let us not mince words: The country is bone-chillingly expensive. The spiraling cost of living is another inadvertent offshoot of the oil boom, but it is also the single biggest impediment to the tourism industry and is why I cannot fully endorse a trip to Norway unless you, like me, are on some crazy ancestral/identity goose chase. I was told never to convert Norwegian kroner into dollars lest you give yourself a stroke, but after purchasing a $12 coffee and $30 personal pizza for the umpteenth time, my very moral fibers began to erode and I contemplated becoming a kleptomaniac just on principle alone. For most of the trip, we had subsisted on apples and nuts and open-face sandwiches, but our last night on the Kong seemed as good a time as any to splurge on all-you-can-eat king crab legs and halibut. But we never got to taste those king crab legs. The dinner hostess, who was a bit shocked to see us — “Where have you been the whole trip?” — seated us at Table 1, the delinquent table, and we waited for the French, who had gathered in a kind of pulsating, impenetrable nebula around the buffet table, to finish loading up their plates. This did not happen. By the time diners had just completed amassing their first helping, people were already getting their second. Wave after wave of passengers came at the buffet, like some kind of culinary re-enactment of the Battle of Normandy. After 15 minutes of waiting without so much as a glimpse of the food through this mass of humanity, our appetites disappeared, and we left the dining room under the reproachful eye of the hostess for the safer ground of the cafeteria, where we ordered our usual prawn-and-tomato-on-bread standby. Unlike the televised Hurtigruten, our boat sailed into Kirkenes sans royal greeting. Nestled in a sheltered bay next to the Russian border, Kirkenes is an oddly anticlimactic terminus for such a beautiful journey. The town, like much of the north, was destroyed during World War II and it feels like a place that was rebuilt without a plan. Walking through the streets, I could not help but be reminded of certain pop-up mining towns in the American West. We stayed at the lovely, if minimalist, Sollia Guesthouse, a 15-minute drive out of town, 500 yards from the Russian border station. Sollia has an operating husky kennel; in the winters you can go on dog sled runs through a boreal forest of small spruce and pine. Curiously, the no-nonsense guesthouse also features a world-class restaurant, Gaphahuken, housed in an elegant wooden wave of a building on the shore of a lake. We ate silky arctic char and reindeer — which is possibly the best tasting meat in the world — and slowly sipped at glasses of white wine while staring at the foreboding specter of Mother Russia on the other side of the lake. The owners, Jorunn and Eivind Nordhus, were delightful. Eivind was also the accomplished chef. A lanky, understated man, he looked a bit like an amateur magician in his chef’s whites. He has cooked for, among others, the Norwegian royal family and the president of Russia. I asked him if the different seasons of light and darkness affected his preparations. He shook his head, “I used to cook in a submarine when I was in the navy,” he said. “So I can cook in a box.” But after pausing a minute he added, “I like the winters. The winters are bigger than the summers.” Indeed, in my anthropological quest to discover how Norwegians survived such extreme seasonal light conditions, I was met with a giant collective shrug. People did universally admit that they slept less in the summer and gained a kind of energy from the sun, but beyond that, they had not really thought about it. “I lived in Florida for a year,” said Trine Moller, the husky trainer at Sollia. “It was much weirder to have no seasons at all.” In the end, I realized my whole premise about the interrelationship between light and sanity was flawed. It was like my turning to someone and asking, “But how do you survive the night? It gets dark every day, right? That’s crazy.” The answer is: Repetition normalizes all. People adapt. It’s what we do. Norwegians do not speak of the midnight sun. The midnight sun is an arbitrary concept invented for tourists’ hats and perpetuated by writers of uncertain talent. But if I’d learned anything on this trip to the north, it is that truth and significance have little to do with each other. Even if glimpsing the sun at midnight was completely arbitrary, I still wanted to see it. And I hadn’t gotten to all trip, as we were blessed with the quite common Norwegian weather of complete, 24-hour cloud cover, which is incredibly disorienting because the light remains flat and endless, and time begins to feel like a distant memory. On our last night in Norway, the sky finally began to clear. So I scurried up a small mountain, just reaching its crest at 11:58 p.m. I had low expectations; I was ready to be disappointed by whatever I saw. The clock struck midnight and there it was: the sun, unimpeded, resplendent. The same sun as always. But what a sun. And what an earth. I imagined myself at the top of a swiftly spinning planet, tilting its head in salutation to that distant solar body. It was what I had seen every day but I had never seen it before today.

A Rare Arctic Land Sale Stirs Concerns in Norway,Norway,"LONGYEARBYEN, NORWAY — For anyone in the market for a majestic waterfront property with easy access to the North Pole, Ole Einar Gjerde has a deal. “We will throw in the polar bears for free,” said Mr. Gjerde, pitching the attractions of a huge tract of Arctic land two and half times bigger than Manhattan but considerably less noisy. It has a human population of zero. But the sale of the property, across a frigid fjord from Longyearbyen, the capital of Norway’s northernmost territory, has kicked up a noisy storm fed by alarm over the Arctic ambitions of a Chinese real estate tycoon with deep pockets, a yen for ice and a murky past working for the Chinese Communist Party. The tycoon, Huang Nubo, was rebuffed last year in an attempt to buy a tract of frozen wilderness in Iceland and has turned his attentions to Norway. This summer he reached a preliminary deal to buy a large waterfront plot for about $4 million near the northern city of Tromso and, according to Norway’s state-owned broadcaster, is also eyeing a much bigger and even more northerly property here on Spitsbergen, the main island in the Svalbard archipelago. Mr. Huang’s company, Beijing Zhongkun Investment Group, denied reports in the Norwegian news media that it wants to buy land here in the high Arctic, and said it is focusing instead on plans for a luxury resort complex in Lyngen, a mountainous area on the Norwegian mainland near Tromso. That project, though centered on land much farther south than Svalbard, still puts Mr. Huang’s company inside the Arctic Circle and has set off a heated debate about his intentions. “No need to doubt that billionaire Huang Nubo is a straw man for the Chinese Communist Party and the country’s authorities,” warned a commentary[http://debatt.nordlys.no/article/ingen-trenger-tvile-pa] in Nordlys, northern Norway’s largest newspaper. Ola Giaever, the seller of the property near Tromso, said he had “100 percent confidence” that Mr. Huang was a straight-up businessman with no hidden agenda. “This is a business deal. Nothing else is going on,” Mr. Giaever said in a telephone interview. Such assurances, however, have done little to calm a frenzy of speculation about China seeking a permanent foothold in the Arctic, a region of growing geopolitical and economic significance as global warming opens new and cheaper shipping routes from Asia and also expands the prospects for exploiting the Arctic’s abundant natural resources. “For anyone interested in geopolitics, this is the region to follow in years to come,” said Willy Ostreng, the president of the Norwegian Scientific Academy for Polar Research[http://www.polar-academy.com/pages/AcademyHistory.htm]. Mr. Huang, he added, “might be just another smiling businessman” genuinely interested in simply developing tourism, but “we are talking about perceptions here.” “And the perception is that China wants a foothold in the Arctic.” Hungry for energy, China has “openly declared its Arctic ambitions,” said Mr. Ostreng, noting that Beijing had invested in an icebreaker, the Snow Dragon; sent scientists to Svalbard to join teams of international researchers; and successfully lobbied to become an observer at the Arctic Council[http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/], a grouping of nations with Arctic land, including Norway, Russia and the United States. It has also tried, so far without success, to get permission to build a large radar antenna on Svalbard. China has even declared itself a “near Arctic state,” a big stretch as even its northernmost region lies more than 1,000 miles from the Arctic Circle. But, Mr. Ostreng said, “When you are a big country, you can claim to be whatever you want, and people believe you.” Wariness of China’s intentions have been fueled in part by the widespread bewilderment here over China’s relentless efforts to punish Norway over the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s decision to honor Liu Xiaobo[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/world/09nobel.html], a jailed Chinese dissident, with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. Furious at the award, China has been on a four-year diplomatic tantrum, repeatedly snubbing Norwegian officials, slashing imports of Norwegian salmon and hectoring Norway for showing insufficient contrition for an award over which the government had no control. Mr. Huang first attracted attention and suspicion in 2012 when he tried to buy a desolate, 100-square-mile tract of land in northern Iceland, saying he wanted to build a golf course and a high-end hotel[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/world/europe/iceland-baffled-by-chinese-plan-for-golf-resort.html] for Chinese tourists. The project fell apart after baffled Icelandic officials invoked laws restricting foreign ownership of land. In the case of Svalbard, however, Norway is barred by the 1920 Svalbard Treaty from imposing any such restrictions. The treaty granted Norway “absolute sovereignty” over the Arctic Archipelago, but also committed it to grant “complete equality” in the purchase and development of Svalbard land to the nationals of all the countries that signed the original treaty, or, like China, joined it later. When the  treaty was signed[http://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/01/1-11/svalbard-treaty.xml] as part of the Versailles negotiations after World War I, the main economic activities on Svalbard were coal mining and fur trapping. Global warming and new technologies, however, mean that Svalbard now sits in the middle of what, in coming decades, is expected to be an Arctic gold rush. The Arctic region[http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=4650], according to the United States Energy Information Administration, holds around 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its natural gas, reserves that have been untouched because of the difficulty and high cost of their development. Russia, which recently announced plans to invest $400 billion on extracting Arctic resources over the next 20 years, believes the region has even more promise, though these plans could be disrupted by Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine. Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft, Russia’s state oil company, has said the Arctic holds over 20 percent of the world’s oil reserves. He also indicated that Russia, despite its increasingly warm relations with China, was uneasy about Beijing’s push into the Arctic, warning that Russia faced “plenty of competition,” not only from nations with well-established Arctic claims like Canada, Norway and the United States, but also “countries which seem to be far from the Arctic,” including China and “even Singapore,” a tropical nation 4,500 miles from the Arctic. “The struggle for resources is getting tougher,” Mr. Sechin said. The land now up for sale, owned by the descendants of a Norwegian shipper who acquired it in 1937, is the first property on Svalbard to go on the market since 1952, and is the only privately held territory left. All the rest is owned by the Norwegian state; a Norwegian state coal company, Store Norske; and a Russian state-owned coal company, the Arctic Coal Trust. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is unique,” said Mr. Gjerde (pronounced gyer-DA), a friend of the family that owns the land and a board member of Austre Adventfjord AS, a company set up last year to manage the property. Henning Horn, a Norwegian industrialist and farmer who owns the property along with other descendants of the original purchaser, is the chairman. Mr. Horn declined, through his lawyer, to be interviewed. When Norwegian news media first reported the planned sale in April[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/svalbard-eiendom-kan-bli-solgt-til-utlandet/a/10130839/] and then named Mr. Huang as a possible buyer, the government immediately came under pressure in Parliament and in the news media to make sure the land did not fall into foreign hands. “Norway cannot take this risk. This is a matter of strategic importance for us,” Liv Signe Navarsete, a former minister and member of the Norwegian Parliament said in an interview. Norway, she added, is open to foreign investment, but after being browbeaten by Beijing for so long over the Nobel Peace Prize, it has no reason to roll out the welcome mat for a Chinese investor in the Arctic. Norwegian officials, she said, have bent over backward to calm Chinese fury over the prize, accepting China as an observer in the Arctic Council, a position denied to the European Union, and refusing to meet Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, during a visit to the Norwegian capital, Oslo, in May. But China has still kept Norway in the deep freeze “to show the world that if you don’t do what they want, you will suffer,” Ms. Navarsete said. Amid a rising clamor against any foreign sale, the government announced in May that it would work to ensure that the Svalbard property remained in Norwegian hands. “The government has decided to work for a solution involving a state takeover,” the trade minister, Monica Maeland, said in a statement[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/nfd/pressesenter/pressemeldinger/2014/Norske-myndigheter-arbeider-for-a-sikre-Austre-Adventfjord-for-allmenheten.html?id=760699]. “It is entirely natural and right that the state is committed to taking over the property.” Efforts to secure state control have yet to bear fruit. Christin Kristoffersen, the mayor of Longyearbyen, Svalbard’s administrative center, said she supported a purchase by the Norwegian state to make sure the region’s fragile wilderness areas do not get swept up in a chaotic rush to exploit Arctic resources. “This is not an area for a new Klondike. We have to tread carefully,” the mayor said. “We should own this island. This is not anti-Chinese, but pro-Norwegian.” Svalbard’s governor, Odd Olsen Ingero, also wants the state to step in, but stressed that even a private buyer would have to abide by strict zoning and environmental regulations. “Starting a hotel over there is unthinkable,” the governor said. Representatives for the owners say the state is welcome to submit a bid but must follow market rules. “We are not in politics or geopolitics. We are in business. We will sell to the highest bidder,” said Arnstein Martin Skaare, a board member of the company managing the sale. “If Norway thinks this land is important for Norway, then it will buy it for a fair market price.” What this price might be is a mystery, with estimates ranging from a few million dollars to over a billion. “You can’t put a price on something that is unique,” said Mr. Ostreng, the polar research expert, noting that property came for sale so rarely in the high Arctic that there was no functioning market to establish even its approximate worth. The property’s immediate economic value, he said, is minimal, as its principal asset, coal, has only lost money for those mining elsewhere on Svalbard. “But if you add in strategic value,” he said, “the price of this land is incalculable.” * Day for Night in Norway[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/travel/day-for-night-in-norway.html] * Along the Oslo Fjord, an Arts District Springs Up[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/travel/along-the-oslo-fjord-an-arts-district-springs-up.html]"
"Global Central Banking in 2014, a Third Quarter Update for 25 Economies",Norway,"The cross-currents of the global economy leave the world's central banks confronting varied policy choices in the months ahead. The U.S. and U.K. recoveries finally have enough momentum for the Federal Reserve and Bank of England to anticipate raising raise short-term interest rates from record lows next year. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan see still weak growth and inflation prompting calls for them to provide more stimulus. Several emerging-market central banks are struggling with the twin challenges of slowing growth and high inflation. And the central banks in China and South Africa may get new leaders soon. Many central banks held interest rates steady in the third quarter, but a few made moves worth noting. The European Central bank and the central banks of Israel, South Korea and Turkey cut interest rates. New Zealand and South Africa raised rates. Central bankers in several countries focused on managing their exchange rates to support their economies.

Fed officials in September repeated their assurance that they will hold their benchmark short-term rate near zero for a ""considerable time"" after the end of their bond-buying program. Most of them--14 out of 17--indicated they expect to start lifting rates next year, and top policy makers officials have encouraged market perceptions that they are likely to move next summer. But discussions have heated up over when to move, with some officials saying they might want to act sooner and others wanting to wait longer. With the bond purchases on track to end in October, officials are likely to tweak the ""considerable time"" sentence in their policy statement by yearend. But they will be careful, knowing any significant change could trigger a strong market reaction. One communication challenge for Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues is reconciling a gap between the sentiment expressed in the policy statement, which indicates the central bank will be very cautious before raising rates, and its so-called dot plot, released quarterly. That chart shows each policy maker's forecast for short-term rates--portrayed as a dot on a chart each year--without identifying the individual by name. The September dot plot showed some officials expecting to raise rates a bit higher over time than they did in June, triggering jitters among investors. Ms. Yellen, at her March press conference, downplayed the dots' significance. And at her September press conference she emphasized the uncertainty surrounding each forecast. Many analysts have also noted that individual Fed officials' influence on policy varies widely, meaning some dots--such as hers--count more than others. European Central Bank By Brian Blackstone The European Central Bank has been the most active of major central banks in recent months with interest-rate cuts, lending programs and private-debt purchase facilities all unveiled since June. Its divergence from other major central banks--notably the Federal Reserve and Bank of England, which are eyeing tighter policies--will continue during the fourth quarter as the ECB loads its balance sheet with four-year loans to banks as well as asset-backed securities and covered bonds.The result has been a sharp depreciation in the euro's exchange rate, which should boost annual inflation-- just 0.3% through September, far below the ECB's 2% target--and economic activity via improved exports. The question that will dominate the rest of the year is: has the ECB done enough? RBS economist Richard Barwell is eyeing three signposts: ""is the euro lower; will the (four-year ECB loan) take-up be higher in December than in September and are inflation expectations lower?"" If these break the ECB's way--meaning a lower exchange rate, strong demand for ECB loans and stable inflation expectations--then its work is largely done. If they don't, look for debate to intensify over whether to launch large-scale government bond purchases. The exchange rate is a dicey issue for the ECB. The central bank doesn't target it, ECB President Mario Draghi repeatedly says. But officials have, though actions and words, engineered a sizeable drop since May, when it was nearly $1.40 against the U.S. dollar. It was $1.26 at the end of September. Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer put it bluntly on Sept. 11: ""we still need to bring down the euro."" If the euro's weakening continues, the ECB will be under less pressure to expand its asset purchases to include government bonds. Another factor to watch is the ECB's balance sheet, particularly how much the lending program will contribute to lifting it back to early 2012 levels--which implies an increase of around EUR1 trillion. If demand for the next loan installment in December disappoints--as did September's EUR83 billion take-up--then the ECB will have to find more assets to buy. With the private-debt option constrained, the ECB may then need to consider buying government bonds, a policy used extensively in the U.S., U.K. and Japan but that is deeply unpopular in Germany where the prospect rekindles fears of 1920s-style inflation. Look for the ECB and financial markets to keep a close watch on an indicator Mr. Draghi put on center stage during a speech in August: the so-called five-year, five-year forward swap rate. This gauge of investors' perception of inflation, starting in five years' time, has weakened in recent weeks. With inflation so low, further declines in this index would up the pressure for broader asset purchases too. One wild-card is Germany. Mr. Draghi had the backing of the German government for his main anti-crisis tool, an open-ended bond purchase program from 2012 called outright Monetary Transactions that hasn't been used. This offset virulent opposition from Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann. But the finance ministry and Bundesbank have been united in criticizing the ECB's latest plan to purchase private-debt securities. That could complicate matters for Mr. Draghi if he decides to touch the Third Rail of German central banking: buying government bonds. Bank of Japan By Jacob M. Schlesinger Japan's economy stumbled unexpectedly hard this summer, stoking skepticism about the effectiveness of the central bank's stimulus program and stirring calls for more action. Then in mid-September, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda got a reprieve, when the yen dropped suddenly to a six-month low against the dollar, fueling a new stock-market rally and giving fresh impetus to his campaign to boost inflation, by lifting import prices. Now Mr. Kuroda, who gave the currency an unusually hard push with rhetoric embracing its drop, will have an easier time fending off pressure to expand his easing program, at least through the end of this year. Even so, the BOJ does face some thorny questions in the fourth quarter. On Oct. 31, the policy board will have to update its economic outlook. Following a spate of weak data after the April sales tax hike, the central bank is all but certain to slash its forecast for growth for the fiscal year ending next March, a concession to critics who say the impact of the Kuroda ""bazooka"" hasn't been as powerful as originally advertised. In December, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe must decide whether to clear a second tax increase slated for next year. Mr. Kuroda has endorsed the move as necessary to curb the government's swollen debt. Some Abe advisors want the central bank help cushion the blow with more easing. Those comments will likely grow louder as the decision nears. By year's end, the BOJ will also get forced into launching a discussion about updating and elaborating on its forward guidance, similar to the rocky debates earlier this year at the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The BOJ's detailed asset-purchase schedule only runs through Dec. 31, and some investors are demanding clarity for 2015 before the year is out. And as Mr. Kuroda nears his second anniversary next April, he will have to offer more details about just how he defines success in his two-year campaign to end deflation, whether it merits extension, or how to exit it. Bank of England By Jason Douglas The Bank of England remains on course to be the first of the world's major central banks to finally call time on years of crisis-era policies and begin raising interest rates early next year. BOE officials led by Gov. Mark Carney are expected to nudge up the U.K. central bank's benchmark interest rate to 0.75% from 0.5% in the first quarter of 2015, roughly three to six months before the Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin raising short-term borrowing costs in the U.S. 30 Sep 2014 18:01 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, a Third Quarter -2- Mr. Carney, in a speech to trade unions in early September, said raising interest rates in the Spring would enable the BOE to keep inflation close to its 2% annual target and allow the economy to create another 1.2 million jobs. ""In other words, we would achieve our mandate,"" he said. A quarter-point rate increase next year would be the first in almost seven years, highlighting the U.K. economy's long and difficult journey back to health after it was laid low by the global financial crisis and a subsequent recession. The BOE cut its benchmark rate to 0.5%--a 320-year low--in March 2009 and has kept it there since. Officials last raised interest rates in July 2007. The U.K. economy is experiencing a burst of growth that has put it among the top-performing advanced economies in the world. Most BOE officials, mindful of the risk that a premature rise in borrowing costs could derail the recovery, have signaled that as long as inflation remains subdued they will hold off pushing up rates. Annual inflation has been below the central bank's 2% target all year. In particular, officials have said they want to see convincing evidence that Britons' real wages are poised to rise. Excluding bonus payments, annual wage growth has averaged less than 1%. Officials are also jittery about an array of risks from overseas that could push the U.K. off course, including feeble growth in the neighboring eurozone and conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East. For two of the BOE's nine rate-setters--Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale--the time to tighten has already arrived, and further good news on the economy may tempt one or two of their colleagues to their side before the end of the year. But for now, the majority appear to share Mr. Carney's view that a rate rise can wait until 2015. People's Bank of China By Lingling Wei China's central bank has resisted pressure to open the credit spigot for much of the year. With a possible change of guard at the bank's helm, its resolve will be further tested in the fourth quarter as the Chinese economy continues to sputter. Some analysts, including economist Tao Wang at UBS, expect the People's Bank of China to adopt more sweeping measures -- such as a blanket cut in interest rates -- in the next three to six months to stoke growth. They point to the continued weakness in industrial production and the property market, which accounts for a quarter of economic output. So far, the People's Bank of China, led by long-serving Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan, has convinced the leadership not to loosen monetary policy broadly for fear of boosting already high debt levels. Instead, the PBOC has launched a number of easing measures aimed at specific sectors, chiefly public housing, private businesses and rural areas. In mid-September, it injected $81 billion into China's five big state-owned banks. Those measures haven't yet arrested the economic slowdown. Increasingly, Chinese leaders are concerned the economy may miss the government's annual growth target -- 7.5% in 2014 -- for the first time since the Asian financial crisis of 1998. In recent months, Premier Li Keqiang has made lowering funding costs a top priority for the central bank, which isn't independent of the government's political leadership. Adding to the uncertainty over monetary policy is the possible departure of Mr. Zhou. Beijing is considering replacing him as part of a wider personnel reshuffle that also comes amid these sharp policy battles. ""The PBOC was the last man standing"" in opposing a broad stimulus plan, an adviser to the central bank says. Reserve Bank of Australia By James Glynn After more than a year with interest rates at record lows, Australia's central bank is still waiting for unambiguous signs of traction in the economy. Unemployment has risen over the past year to a decade-high of just above 6%, while growth across the resource-rich economy remains patchy as a long mining-investment boom cools. The low rates have done little so far except fire up the housing market. Of particular concern to the Reserve Bank of Australia is that the rampant house-price gains have been driven mostly by investors. That raises the risk of a crash down the line that could unwind its efforts to boost consumer spending and return the broader economy to a more healthy pace of growth. The RBA is now in talks with the banking regulator over plans to make it harder for investors to get mortgages. It has warned that economic stability is at risk if the pace of house-price growth isn't contained. The economy remains too weak for the RBA to raise interest rates from 2.5%. And some forecasters believe the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged until at least 2016. A high Australian dollar, meanwhile, has held back exports in key industries such as tourism, manufacturing and education, though some of that pressure now appears to be coming off. The U.S. dollar has rallied amid rising expectations the Federal Reserve will move to raise interest rates next year. The Australian dollar has fallen 6% in the last month on the back of that, but a further drop would be needed to convince businesses the currency will stay low. Inflation remains weak and wage growth has fallen sharply over the past year, raising hope the central bank won't be facing an inflation shock any time soon. This has made it easier for the central bank to keep interest rates low to help the economy. Central Bank of Brazil By Paulo Trevisani Brazil's central bank held interest rates steady in the third quarter, but found itself at the center of a presidential campaign debate over whether it should have more autonomy. Brazilians elect a president in October and the two leading candidates are the incumbent Dilma Rousseff and Socialist-Party candidate Marina Silva. The central bank reports to the president. Ms. Silva has pledged to grant the bank more autonomy by creating fixed terms for the governors. The Rousseff camp countered that central-bank autonomy is equal to handing economic-policy over to bankers. A campaign commercial showed bankers plotting in a dark room while food disappeared from a working-family table. Ms. Rousseff told reporters that, since an autonomous central bank wouldn't focus on employment, its policies could ""indeed take food out"" from workers' tables. A central-bank spokesman declined to comment, and the central bank has remained aloof while pundits and politicians jumped on the subject. Ms. Rousseff is seen by analysts as a hands-on manager when it comes to the economy. Many observers said she was a strong influence when the central bank cut rates to the historic low of 7.25% in 2012, even though inflation was above target, something both the Rousseff administration and the bank strongly deny. The bank left its benchmark Selic interest rate unchanged at 11% through the quarter. The statement issued after its September policy meeting appeared to indicate no rate cut is in sight. The economy shrank in the first half of the year. Inflation is at 6.5%, while the target is 4.5% with a two-point tolerance range. The central bank and private-sector analysts don't expect the target to be reached before mid-2016 Bulgaria's Central Bank By Sean Carney A shakeup is likely at the Bulgarian central bank this autumn after the country endured its worst banking crisis in nearly two decades this summer. The central bank is responsible for overseeing local financial markets. Its senior figures have faced widespread criticism for lax oversight and for being too close to parties with vested interests in local banks. The central bank's governor Ivan Iskrov has offered his resignation but personnel changes will come only after Bulgaria's parliamentary elections due Oct. 5. The country's currency, the lev, looks safe from volatility in coming months despite the expected shake up as it is pegged to the euro. Bank of Canada By Nirmala Menon The recent message from Canadian central bankers was clear. Despite a recent string of stronger-than-expected economic data, they are in no hurry to alter the Bank of Canada's stance that rate cuts as likely as rate hikes. Almost every economist expects the Bank to raise rates when it moves from the sidelines. Increasingly, it appears this will not happen until after the U.S. Federal Reserve starts lifting its benchmark rate, which investors expect around mid-2015. This means the Canadian central bank's benchmark overnight rate will end 2014 at 1% for the fourth consecutive year. Gov. Stephen Poloz said on Sept. 16 that recent data have been encouraging and he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the exports outlook. But a more substantial recovery is needed before Canadian firms become confident enough to boost investments and hiring, which will take time, he said. Canadian policymakers are counting on exports and business investment to take the baton from indebted consumers and drive economic growth. ""What happens next is still is a question mark for us,"" Mr. Poloz said. ""And so I would say that there is still a strong case to be waiting and seeing."" If Mr. Poloz was ""squarely neutral,"" subsequent comments from his second-in-command Carolyn Wilkins were ""dovishly neutral,"" according to TD Securities' foreign exchange strategist Martin Schwerdtfeger. Ms. Wilkins said on Sept. 22 that ""persistent headwinds"" may force the central bank to keep rates low even after economic slack is absorbed and the output gap--the difference between the amount of goods and services and economy can produce and how much it is producing--closes in about two years. Two days late, her colleague on the rate-setting governing council, deputy governor Tim Lane, said Canadian policy can diverge from the Fed's, and noted that the Canadian policy rate is higher than the near-zero U.S. equivalent--another suggestion that the bank of Canada will not front-run the Fed. There is ""absolutely no appetite for the Bank of Canada to move ahead of the Fed,"" said TD Securities' Mr. Schwerdtfeger. Czech National Bank By Sean Carney 30 Sep 2014 18:01 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, a Third Quarter -3- The Czech central bank, which for 22 months has had its interest rates at near-zero rates, will maintain its policy of using the foreign-exchange rate as a monetary policy tool in the coming months as it seeks to boost consumer price growth. The central European economy contracted for most of the past two years and was among the first countries in the region to face the threat of deflation. Central bank governor Miroslav Singer has recently said the bank will not allow the koruna to appreciate to more than 27 per euro at least until 2016. Mr. Singer said that the weak koruna has boosted exports and is now having the sought-after inflationary impact on the domestic Czech economy. Denmark's Nationalbanken By Charles Duxbury The Danish central bank will keep a watchful eye on the European Central Bank in coming months as it seeks to protect the Danish currency's peg to the euro. It may be forced to intervene in currency markets or even take its deposit rate further into negative territory if upward pressure on the Danish krone becomes too extreme, analysts say. That's because of all the European central banks outside the eurozone, Denmark's is perhaps the most affected by ECB policies. Its sole policy objective is to keep the Danish krone within 2.25% on either side of a level of 7.46038 krone to the euro. The bank earlier in September cut its deposit rate back below zero, tracking an earlier move by the ECB, to maintain the stability of the Danish currency against the euro. The deposit rate was negative for nearly two years until spring this year as the central bank sought to sap demand for krone assets and weaken the currency. It was raised back above zero in April. Nordea bank analyst Jan Storup Nielsen said growing speculation about further stimulus measures by the ECB has intensified an existing trend towards a stronger krone against the euro. So far, the krone appreciation has not been strong enough to prompt the central bank to intervene in the currency market. If the krone strengthens further, the central bank will most likely start selling its own currency and there is a risk of a further cut to the deposit rate, Mr. Nielsen said. National Bank of Hungary By Margit Feher Having announced in July it was done easing credit, Hungary's central bank is widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged for the rest of the year at an all-time low of 2.1%. The bank has pledged not to alter the rate this year, since the annual rate of inflation was 0.2% in August and is expected to accelerate closer to the 3.0% target by the end of 2015. The central bank also wants to support economic growth. Propelled by European Union support funds and increasing car manufacturing output, the economy grew 3.9% in the second quarter from a year earlier. But the central bank expects that to slow to 2.4% next year. Some analysts say the central bank may be tempted to cut rates later this year if it appears possible to do without weakening the forint. The prospect of higher interest rates in the U.S. hasn't yet led to large scale withdrawals of capital from emerging markets such as Hungary, while additional European Central Bank easing may make emerging European investments more attractive. The ECB's steps are helping Hungary keep its monetary policy loose ""for as long as possible rather than [providing] a new opportunity to continue the easing cycle,"" said ING economist Andras Balatoni. Instead of cutting rates further, which would most likely weaken the Hungarian forint, the central bank may want to let the currency appreciate, Mr. Balatoni added. Reserve Bank of India By Gabriele Parussini India's economy seems to be on a roll: growth is accelerating, external imbalances are shrinking and the rupee so far looks immune from the pressure weighing on other emerging-market currencies. The Reserve Bank of India will be listening to the crescendo for the only off-key note: inflation. Much of what Gov. Raghuram Rajan does in the coming months depends on whether consumer price increases slow down enough. Mr. Rajan has kept India's main interest rate steady at 8% for eight months now. Mr. Rajan is hearing differing calls. Businessmen and politicians clamor for a rate cut to boost the economy, while the IMF goes so far as to suggest a further rate hike to tame prices. RBI watchers know he won't loosen policy unless inflation shows clears signs of abating. And with global headwinds set to rise again soon, the balance Mr. Rajan has achieved looks fragile. The U.S. Federal Reserve is on track to end its bond-buying program in October and is expected to start raising U.S. interest rates next year. Emerging markets could face huge capital outflows as investors take their money back to developed countries. On the other hand, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have taken their interest rates below zero, hoping to stimulate investment and growth, and are unlikely to change direction in the foreseeable future. These cross-currents could give the RBI Governor some breathing space. Bank Indonesia By I Made Sentana Bank Indonesia maintained high interest rates in the third quarter to help rein in the Southeast Asian nation's current-account deficit, a broad measure of its trade balance. Because inflation has eased, it is not under pressure to boost borrowing costs for now. The central bank has left its benchmark BI interest rate unchanged this year 7.5%. The current-account gap--the amount by which its imports of goods and services exceed its exports--more than doubled to US$9.1 billion (4.3% of gross domestic product) in this year's second quarter from US$4.2 billion (2.1% of GDP) in the first quarter. Inflation has declined to 3.99% in August from 8.79% a year earlier, as the economy adjusted to last year's fuel price increase. The central bank has refrained from raising interest rates because economic growth slowed to 5.12% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in five years, from 5.21% in the January-March period. Bank Indonesia could face mounting pressures to increase interest rates if inflation rises. President-elect Joko Widodo has indicated he may raise subsidized fuel prices to try to reduce the subsidy's impact on the government's budget. His advisers say they are proposing to increase the price by 3,000 rupiah a liter after Mr.Widodo assumes power Oct. 20. ""If the government increases fuel prices by 3,000 rupiah this year, inflation will accelerate to 9%,"" Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Gov. Mirza Adityaswara said on Sept. 19. That would be above the central bank's 2014 target for inflation of between 3.5% and 5.5%. Mr. Adityaswara didn't say what Bank Indonesia's response would be, but many economists expect it would lift interest rates if inflation jumps. Bank of Israel By Joshua Mitnick A dramatic 50-day military clash with Hamas stoked dramatic moves on the Bank of Israel's monetary policy in the third quarter. Amid daily barrages of rocket strikes that kept the public at home, the Israeli central bank cut its benchmark lending rate for August and September by a quarter percentage point each month to bring it to 0.25%. Even before the conflict, policymakers worried about sagging growth amid pressure on the country's all-important export sector. The central bank said in September it would leave the benchmark rate for October unchanged, and it may decide to follow suit in November and December to see how the economy reacts to having interest rates at an all-time low. Another challenge for Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug: near-zero inflation. Annual consumer price growth was 0.30% in August, well below the 1% lower boundary for the government's inflation target. Analysts say inflation expectations for the next 12 months have even moved into negative territory, another worrisome sign. Some analysts say that the bank could decide on another cut to 0.15% before the end of the year -- a move that would ""test the zero boundary"" according to analyst Terrence Klingman of Psagot Investment House Ltd. Rate cuts translate into a weaker shekel, a development that's likely to make exports more competitive. Concern about the effect of ultra-low rates on Israel's surging housing sector has become secondary, say analysts. Much depends on the U.S. Federal Reserve. ""Only after the U.S. starts raising interest rates will the [Israeli] bank raise rates. We expect [Israeli] rates to be unchanged,"" said Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at Meitav Dash Securities. Bank of Korea By Kwanwoo Jun Attention in South Korea is focused on whether the central bank will deliver another rate cut before the end of the year to support government efforts to juice economic growth. The Bank of Korea made its first rate cut in 15 months in August, lowering its policy rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%, a move widely seen as supporting a $40 billion economic stimulus package announced by the government a month earlier. Economists are split over whether the BOK will ease again in the fourth quarter. In September, the government said it would run a wider fiscal deficit next year to boost spending and spur growth. Some central bank watchers expect the BOK to stand pat for the time being before beginning to raise rates next year in line with the Federal Reserve's anticipated policy tightening. South Korea's gross domestic product grew 0.5% on-quarter for the three months to June--slower than 0.9% growth in the first quarter--as consumer spending was hit badly by April's ferry sinking disaster. Data on third-quarter growth are due in late October. In July, the BOK trimmed its growth forecast for 2014 to 3.8% from 4%. It expects the economy to expand 4% in 2015. Inflation remains benign. Bank of Mexico By Anthony Harrup The Bank of Mexico is widely expected to stay on hold in the fourth quarter as it did in third, having already cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low 3% to address sluggish economic growth. 30 Sep 2014 18:01 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, a Third Quarter -4- Since June's surprise rate cut, the central bank led by Agustín Carstens has become less breezy about inflation, and a bit more upbeat about growth. The economy picked up pace in the second quarter, growing at an annualized rate of 4.2% from the first quarter and beating the central bank's estimate, while consumer price inflation has accelerated to 4.2% as of mid-September, above the bank's 2%-4% comfort zone. In July, the central bank was still expecting inflation to approach its 3% target in January of 2015, but by September it had hedged the forecast to say in the first half of next year. Board members also expressed concern about recent opposition proposals to raise the country's minimum wage, which is the lowest among the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. ""The minutes of Banxico's September 5 meeting confirmed a shift to a slightly more restrictive tone by policy makers and highlighted some discrete risks to the inflation outlook, such as the debate on raising the minimum wage,"" Citi said in a report. ""We reiterate our view of the next rate move being up, but not until mid-2015."" Many observers expect the Bank of Mexico will wait until the U.S. Federal Reserve starts to raise rates before following suit, a view which gained traction as the minutes of the latest meeting showed board members concerned with the impact the Fed moves could have on the exchange rate and inflation. ""This has always been the case, but to the extent that we are now closer to the end of zero rates in the US, Banxico's board is increasingly concerned,"" said Nomura. Reserve Bank of New Zealand By Rebecca Howard After four consecutive interest-rate increases this year, New Zealand's central bank kept rates on hold in September to deal with a double-blow from tumbling export prices and a stubbornly high local currency. New Zealand's agriculture-focused economy has been supported in recent years by surging demand from Asia's rising middle classes for its dairy exports, and by a construction boom following a series of devastating earthquakes. As a result, the economy outperformed many of its peers, with growth currently at a 10-year high. The Kiwi central bank was among the first in the developed world to raise interest rates since the global recession, lifting them by one percentage point this year to 3.50%. Global dairy prices, however, are down more 45% since a peak in February and that--coupled with weaker forestry export prices, moderate inflation and the still-high Kiwi dollar--led the central bank to pause. Still, while inflation remains moderate, the reserve bank sees dangers on the horizon. It hasn't finished raising rates, and has said future credit tightening will be needed to keep average inflation near the mid-point of its 1%-to-3% target band. One of the main drivers of inflation will continue to be rising immigration, with record numbers of migrants buying homes and boosting spending in the economy. House-price inflation remains a concern, but has slowed on the back of the higher interest rates and new tools aimed at curbing lending. The bank has said it's keeping a watchful eye on both the housing market and the exchange rate. The New Zealand dollar has lost ground recently--it's currently about 8.7% lower than this year's peak in July, but remains historically high and a drag on growth, the central bank has said. Many economists are expecting the next rate increase to come sometime between March and June next year. Norway's Central Bank By Charles Duxbury Norway's central bank took investors by surprise in September with a hawkish policy statement, but it may have to tone that message down if the country's currency, the krone, continues to strengthen this autumn. The Norwegian currency jumped against the euro Sep. 18 after Norges Bank removed the chance of an interest-rate cut from its short-term forecasts following a steady rise in inflation in the oil-rich nation. The bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.5% but removed a sentence it had included in a June statement about needing to cut borrowing costs if the economy were to struggle. The Norwegian economy is one of Europe's strongest, underpinned by oil and gas wealth. The mainland economy grew 1.2% in the second quarter, far outstripping the eurozone and its Nordic neighbors. The outlook for the economy isn't the worry for Norges Bank that it appeared to be earlier this year. A stronger currency could be a concern, though, as it could reduce inflation via lower prices for imports. The Norwegian krone strengthened more than 1% against the euro after the latest interest rate announcement and could continue higher against the euro, analysts said. The central bank hasn't moved its benchmark interest rate in more than two years. National Bank of Poland By Patryk Wasilewski Following a 14-month break, Poland's central bank is set to restart its credit-easing campaign in the fourth quarter to support the country's weak recovery and boost inflation. The central bank's governor Marek Belka in September opened the door to a cut in the country's 2.5% benchmark interest rate in October, and recent comments by his fellow rate setters suggest a broad consensus in favor of further easing is being formed. For the first time on record, consumer prices fell in the 12 months to July and analysts expect prices to keep dropping until November. The 10-members of the central bank's rate-setting panel had hoped to see deflation reversed by an accelerating recovery, but the growth has nearly stalled. The economy expanded 1.1% in the first quarter and just 0.6% in the second, weighed down by a Russian embargo on food imports, weaker growth in the European Union and increased uncertainty due to Ukraine's conflict with Russia. With rate cuts nearly certain, the market's focus is now on the pace and scale of the easing campaign about to start in October. Some analysts believe the central bank's rate-setting panel will deliver a bigger cut than its traditional quarter-percentage-point move. Economists estimate the central bank will cut rates by cumulative total of a half to a full percentage point over coming months, depending on pace of economic recovery. Bank of Russia By Andrey Ostroukh After raising interest rates three times since the beginning of the year, the Bank of Russia is caught between a rock and a hard place as it aims to tame stubbornly-high inflation without putting additional pressure on flagging economic growth. The Russian central bank was forced to raise rates in March when Moscow indicated it intended to annex the Ukrainian region of Crimea. The central bank's emergency move, designed to prop up the plummeting ruble, was then accompanied by further rate hikes as the inflation rate continued to rise. In September, the Bank of Russia left its key rates unchanged but said it stood ready to tighten the monetary policy further should inflation accelerates again from levels of around 7.5%, which is above the 2014 inflation ceiling of 6.5% set by the central bank. The inflation rate was boosted this year by Moscow's decision to retaliate against sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union. In August, Russia banned food imports from countries that sanctioned Moscow. The move reduced food supplies and is expected to fuel inflation well into 2015. Despite the sanctions, massive capital outflows and a slowing economy, the central bank is sticking to its plan to switch to an inflation-targeting policy from 2015, which requires a free float of the ruble. The ruble touched its all-time lows in September but it found no support from the central bank, which last intervened in foreign exchange markets in May. The central bank has recently expanded the ruble's trading band, and says it reserves the right to intervene by selling foreign currencies if necessary for the country's financial stability. The central bank will meet on rates again on October 31 when it is expected either to hold rates if inflation does not rise, or tighten policy marginally to signal its commitment to rein in consumer price increases. South African Reserve Bank Patrick McGroarty The big question surrounding the South African Reserve Bank isn't whether interest rates will rise but who will raise them. Governor Gill Marcus surprised investors in September when she said she wouldn't seek a second five-year term at the head of the bank. She didn't give a reason and said she knew the bank would be in good hands. Economists say President Jacob Zuma will likely hand the top job to one of the bank's current deputies, Daniel Mminele or Lesetja Kganyago. Both are respected bankers who would likely continue the pragmatic, conservative approach to rate setting that Ms. Marcus embraced while she steered the bank through an exceptionally turbulent time for South Africa's economy. Her successor will confront the same opposing--and complicating--forces of high inflation and slow economic growth that often tie policymakers' hands. Following many of her emerging-market peers looking to protect themselves from the effects of the end of the Fed's bond-buying spree, she raised the bank's key rate by a half percentage point in January to 5.5%. Though she pledged to make that hike the beginning of a trend, she managed just one more increase in July to 5.75%. When South Africa's new central bank governor announces his or her first rate decision in November, it is likely to come after a mission statement that hews closely to Ms. Marcus's rising-rates vision. But the new governor might also have to defer a rate increase if growth doesn't pick up from the abysmal 1.5% annual expansion that Ms. Marcus says the economy is likely to post this year. Sweden's Riksbank By Charles Duxbury Sweden's central bank heads into the fourth quarter facing a continued challenge to push up inflation which has been stuck around zero for much of this year. 30 Sep 2014 18:01 ET Global Central Banking in 2014, a Third Quarter -5- The Riksbank has an inflation target of 2% and has over recent months made clear that meeting this target is its priority. In doing so it has signaled that concerns over rising Swedish household debt are now secondary and are something for lawmakers to deal with. The bank's central forecast signals an unchanged main interest rate until late 2015, when it will be gradually raised. However, the minutes of its most recent policy meeting made clear the executive board will cut its main rate from its current record low of 0.25% if its needs to. One of the six rate-setting board members, Karolina Ekholm, said that as inflation is so low ""there are still reasons for attaching a higher probability to a repo-rate cut than a repo-rate increase in the near term."" Her colleague Martin Floden said it may be necessary to make monetary policy more expansionary, by cutting the repo rate or postponing the first increase, if new information comes in that leads to a lower forecast for inflation in the short and medium term. Both board members said if inflation looked to be rising faster than expected they would be in no hurry to raise rates, not least because inflation has been so low for so long. This focus on boosting inflation--rather than worrying about overshooting the inflation target--was something they termed an ""asymmetrical"" approach to policy. The term has been seized on by analysts here as a theme for the months ahead. Swiss National Bank By Neil MacLucas The third anniversary of the Swiss central bank's imposition of zero interest rates and a ceiling for the Swiss franc's value against the euro has passed, with no sign of change in the foreseeable future. That doesn't mean calm waters ahead. Swiss central bankers will keep close watch on developments at the European Central Bank, whose aggressive easing policies have weakened the euro, and on a frothy Swiss housing market. The Swiss National Bank has kept policy on hold for 13-straight quarters, scotching speculation it would follow the ECB in resorting to negative interest rates to stem investor demand for the franc, perceived as a haven in times of global tension. Since mid-September 2011, the main focus of the SNB has been defending its 1.20 franc-per-euro exchange rate cap--meaning the franc can't strengthen beyond that level. And with the franc gaining in recent weeks due to tensions in Ukraine, it has little room to maneuver. SNB President Thomas Jordan said the central bank hadn't intervened in the currency market in September, reflecting the high degree of credibility its intervention threat has in markets. Still, Mr. Jordan wouldn't rule out the use of negative interest rates to curb demand for the Swiss currency if necessary. Moreover economists noted the wording of September's policy meeting was more dovish than expected, with policy makers cutting this year's economic growth forecast to 1.5%, from 2%. The SNB also has concerns about the Swiss property market boom, which is being partly fueled by ultra-low mortgage rates, and although there are signs of a slowdown in mortgage lending, it sees little evidence of an easing in the imbalances that have built up in the real estate market in recent years. Since it cannot increase rates for fear of boosting the franc, it will probably stick to its verbal warnings on the dangers of the housing market overheating. Central Bank of The Republic of Turkey By Emre Peker Turkey's central bank faces an uphill battle in the final quarter of 2014, pressured by the government to stoke economic growth with looser credit just as markets demand a tighter stance against stubbornly high inflation. The competing agendas were evident in the central bank's Sept. 25 decision. Policymakers held all its interest rates steady for the first time since March, yet softened their emphasis on inflationary risks. With annual inflation jumping to 9.54% in August and yearend expectations anchored at 9%, almost double the 5% official target, economists have been warning Gov. Erdem Basci against eroding the central bank's credibility with rate cuts. ""Despite the challenging external and domestic backdrop, we believe that the central bank of Turkey will look for opportunities to ease if the lira and global conditions permit,"" said Ilker Domac and Gultekin Isiklar, Citibank economists in Istanbul. ""We remain skeptical about this approach."" Since May, Mr. Basci has cut the central bank's benchmark interest rate to 8.25%, despite rising inflation. The government has nonetheless slammed policymakers for not easing quickly enough as growth sputtered to 2.1% in the second quarter on an annualized basis from 4.7% in the first quarter. With the U.S. Federal Reserve mulling rate increases in 2015 and emerging markets bracing for selloffs, Turkey's central bank will have to balance government demands to boost growth while trying to convince investors about its commitment to slow inflation. Investors doubt the central bank can pull it off, and have driven Turkey's lira to an eight-month low against the dollar, threatening to fuel faster price increases.

"Big oil, small village... was it worth it?",Norway,"Long before pylons had us pitting the environment against the economy, there was Corrib. Debate over oil firm Shell's exploiting of the natural gas field off the coast of Mayo raged for over a decade. Now, billions over budget and eight years later, Ireland's biggest ever private engineering project is nearly finished. We went to Mayo to ask Shell, protestors and local businesses whether it has all been worth it ELMULLET could be any rural Irish village. BLocated on a narrow peninsula on the northwest Mayo coast and reachable by just one snaking, potholed road, it takes four long hours to drive there, pedal to the metal, from Dublin. It is a beautiful place, windswept and weatherbeaten, covered in vast swathes of golden and purple heather. Sparsely populated, its residents total just 1,000 people. The vast Gaeltacht region of Erris in which its situated has just 10,000. The people here are welcoming and traditional, and still define each other by their parish. Hundreds of Irish towns and villages fit that same description. But something makes Belmullet different to the rest. It is bustling. The well-kept town centre is so busy that it is hard to find parking on a Monday afternoon. Its pubs and hotels buzz with customers. There is no evidence of the recession that decimated most of rural Ireland's high streets. The reason for this is natural gas, and Shell. The Corrib gas field is Ireland's second ever commercially viable gas find, following the discovery of the Kinsale Head gas field in 1971. It was first discovered in 1996, 80km off the coast of Erris Head in an area licensed by UK oil and gas explorer Enterprise Oil. It contains an estimated 1 trillion cubic feet of gas. Shell gained the right to develop Corrib when it bought Enterprise in 2002. Serious work on the field began in 2004 when the company lodged a planning application for a gas processing terminal at Ballinaboy, a 10-minute drive from Belmullet village centre. Unlike Kinsale, where gas is processed offshore, Corrib's gas is being brought to land via a tunnel and pipeline before processing. Then all hell broke loose. Most of us are familiar with the story. There were mounting safety and environmental concerns and dissatisfaction over the proposed route of the pipeline and location of the terminal. Shell to Sea, one of the most vocal protest groups the country has ever seen, came to national attention. Five protesters were jailed for 80 days; others went on hunger strike. A series of planning challenges brought construction virtually to a halt. These and other problems have delayed the project by around eight years. This has helped push its total cost to around €3.5bn, more than four times as much as Shell originally estimated. But now, finally, it is nearly there. The majority of the pipeline and processing terminal is completed. Gas is expected to start pumping early next year. For Shell, that means a relatively happy ending for one of the darker chapters in its corporate history. For Belmullet, it is not necessarily a good thing. The vast majority of the jobs that the development of Corrib created — around 1,000 sustained over a decade, and 1,400 at peak — were involved in construction. Once this finishes, worker numbers will drop back to the 175 people who will be needed to run the gas terminal over the 15-20-year life span of the field. This fall off in employment does not only have consequences for the people who will immediately lose their jobs. It will also have implications for the hundreds of businesses in the region that have been sustained, for 10 years, by Shell and its workers. This ranges from civil engineering firms whose annual revenue runs into the hundreds of millions, to Belmullet's two hotels, to its shops, restaurants, bank, post office and hardware stores. County Mayo's most famous resident also made the trip to Belmullet this week. The Taoiseach was in town to launch Erris Enterprise Week and announce a new high-speed broadband line for Mayo and Galway, part-funded by Shell, which will be wired through the Corrib pipeline. After a Full Irish with local business owners, Mr Kenny addressed the audience from a stage plastered with Shell insignia. Very few private companies get that opportunity. The Taoiseach is optimistic about the future for the people who have built the Corrib development. ""A lot of young Irish people have gained enormous expertise and confidence as a result of being given responsibility for very sensitive issues, be they environmental or whatever, in the development of the Corrib project,"" he said. Fianna Fail's Dara Calleary, Mayo's sole non-Fine Gael TD, was less optimistic. ""The end of construction on the pipeline, which has provided most of the jobs, is a major concern for me. We need to start planning now. There is an exceptionally good skill set here — now we need to start marketing it."" Belmullet's businesses are all too aware of it, too. Orla Talbot, owner of the 21-room Talbot hotel, described it as ""a fear of the unknown."" ""But we are optimistic. Thousands of people have come to Belmullet as a result of it who otherwise would have never come near us. Guys that came here for a year to work on the site have built holiday and retirement homes here. It has put this area on the map as a tourist destination. And there will be people coming and going for years as they service the terminal."" Shell Ireland is headed up by an affable Canadian in his 50s, Michael Crothers. He has spent nearly three decades at Shell and managed far larger projects before Corrib, responsible for 30 or 40 countries at a time. The fact that someone so senior was parachuted into the Irish job in 2011 says much about how problematic it has been for Shell. The company's experience in Erris has been ""very challenging"" Mr Crothers said in a wideranging interview. ""If you look at the situation we largely created for ourselves at the beginning when we first came in to work in Erris, we just didn't spend enough time understanding the sentiment on the ground and the concerns of the community."" The company ploughed millions into improving its reputation and relationship with the people of Erris post-2007, after things started to go badly wrong. As well as hiring locally and gifting grants to local businesses and causes, it has spent €19m on roads in the area. ""Through a lot of honest conversation I think we have really progressed a long way to the point where the community has tolerated and accepted to a large degree the project. We can't say we have the full support of the community; there are still some people who have strongly held views that don't accept it. But if you look at the broad sentiment and the support that we are getting from a wide spectrum of Erris, we have come a long way,"" said Mr Crothers. The reduction in job numbers when construction on Corrib finishes will be gradual, he added, and routine maintenance will create jumps in employment in future. But the question about what will happen to the hundreds about to lose their jobs when construction finishes remains. So does the debate about how Ireland handles its fossil fuels, about the sanity of allowing industry into one of the country's most spectacular beauty spots and about whether short-term economic gain justifies projects like Corrib. ""Jobs at any cost is not good enough,"" said Shell to Sea spokesperson and local woman Maura Harrington. ""Where do we draw the line — about 40 years ago someone tried to get a nuclear power plant built here, citing emigration. And it hasn't even been the answer to unemployment. Erris remains bedevilled by emigration."" Shell's Corrib project will escape the Government's recent changes to the taxes imposed on oil and gas companies profiting from Irish hydrocarbons, since its licence was awarded before the changes. The main levy it faces is a corporation tax rate of 25pc on any profit. This is double the current national rate for other businesses, Mr Crothers pointed out. Others feel differently. ""Before declaring profits, the company can write of 100pc of costs against this tax, including the cost of previous, unsuccessful wells drilled anywhere in Irish waters,"" said Shell to Sea. The very fact that Government changed the old terms suggests that it too felt they were overly beneficial for mining companies. When discussing the taxes Ireland charges for petroleum, government and mining companies definitely agree on one thing: Ireland does not have much of the stuff in the first place. We cannot impose the same lucrative taxes as countries like oil-rich Norway, they argue, when there is a much higher risk and far less chance of success when exploring Irish waters. It is that poor success rate, not the negative experience that Shell has had with protesters or regulators in Corrib, that will deter other mining companies from Ireland, Mr Crothers said. ""Is there some concern about the time it has taken Corrib to progress? About some of the complexity in the regulations — which is being worked through, but it's still fairly complex compared to other jurisdictions? Yes. ""But I think the underlying decision is about the risk and whether you are going to find something. One well offshore will cost about €150m. So it's a big gamble. If you have that option versus maybe working in the North Sea, where there is very well known geology, very understood long-term business over 50 years, companies are loathe to take that risk."" Aidan Heavey, the Offaly-born chief executive of Tullow Oil, is less reticent. ""We have not covered ourselves in glory with Corrib,"" Mr Heavey, one of the country's best-paid CEOs, told me earlier this year. He refers to delays to Corrib as ""years of lost tax revenues for the State."" ""Multinationals have found it very difficult to work in the west of Ireland,"" said Mr Heavey. That debate ended long ago for Belmullet. There were no protesters during Enda Kenny's visit, though Shell to Sea's Maura Harrington said their campaign is far from over. Life has mostly returned to normal ""It hasn't taken over Belmullet"" Orla Talbot said. ""Maybe it did for a few years, but that has settled down. Tourists visit now and don't know Shell is here."""
Norway Faces New Economic Realities With Oil’s Price Decline; Most of the Revenues from the Nation’s Oil Industry Have Been Invested in Its Sovereign-wealth Fund,Norway,"OSLO—As global oil prices slide, there are signs Norway’s luck is running thin. On Wednesday, Statoil ASA, the oil and gas major 67%-owned by the Norwegian government, posted its first quarterly net loss since it floated on the stock market in 2001. The company blamed heavy write-downs on investments that look less profitable after the near-25% fall in oil prices since June. Separately, Norway’s $838 billion sovereign-wealth fund—the largest of its kind in the world that long has been fueled by oil revenues—said it achieved a slim 0.1% return on investments in the third quarter, thanks to a loss on its substantial holdings of European equities. The twin set of bad news was compounded by weaker-than-expected economic data that showed Norway’s retail sales declined in September while its unemployment rate rose in August. That pushed Norway’s currency to an eight-month low against the euro at 8.48 kroner for each euro. For a country used to strong growth and high standards of living, the reversal in fortunes is a shock. With a population of around 5 million, Norway has the second-highest gross domestic product per head in Europe after tiny Luxembourg. As the eurozone contracted in both 2012 and 2013, Norway’s mainland economy grew by 3.4% and 2% in both those years. “When we lose the boost from the oil sector, we may become more similar to other countries,” said DNB Markets analyst Kyrre Aamdal in an interview. Statoil, which accounts for about a third of Norway’s equity market by value, blamed its quarterly loss of $711 million mainly on a heavy write-down at a high-cost Canadian oil sands project, and a drop in the value of oil it holds in storage. Its acting Chief Executive Eldar Sætre warned the good times might not return soon. “You could see even lower prices, you could see them low for a sustained period of time,” he said in an interview. Statoil already has reined in its spending plans and announced a cost-savings program in February. That has led to layoffs in the country’s oil-services industry, including at companies like Aibel, Bilfinger and Aker Solutions. Last year, Norway’s oil and gas sector invested a record 212 billion kroner ($31.88 billion), equivalent to about 10% of the country’s mainland GDP. But the fall in oil prices means the industry likely will cut its spending in each of the next three years, DNB said Wednesday. The bank previously had expected only a short-term decline next year. Most of the revenues from Norway’s oil industry—including taxes and Statoil dividends—have been invested in its sovereign-wealth fund, commonly known as the oil fund. A fall in oil prices could affect inflows into the fund at a time when its returns are weak. About 12% of the Norwegian government’s annual spending comes from cash from the oil fund. Still, the fund’s manager, Yngve Slyngstad, said Norway would continue to benefit from using the fund to recycle its oil wealth into other sectors that don’t rely on the commodity’s price. “The first thing we should be happy about as a nation, is that we’ve actually taken out 40% of the oil, and a lot of that has been invested in the oil fund, which in a sense isn’t vulnerable in the same way. The grand idea about the oil fund is to diversify our national wealth,” Mr. Slyngstad said. Meanwhile some analysts argued the krone’s fall could benefit Norway too, for example by boosting the earnings of non-oil exporters such as aluminum producer Norsk Hydro, fertilizer producer Yara International, or the tourism industry. The Norwegian krone “is in many ways a stabilizing factor. When the economy performs well, we get a strong krone that dampens the activity of internationally-competitive industries. When the economy performs badly, the currency weakens and increases their activity,” said DNB Markets’ Mr. Aamdal."
Déjà vu for cruise ship as it gets stranded in Norway for the second time this year (and the pier where it was to moor is agonisingly in sight),Norway,"* 1,000 people on board the Marco Polo, many of them Britons * The same ship had ran aground in March this year, with reasons unknown * Made headlines in February when pensioner was killed when wave entered * Was cruising along Norway's fjords when it got into difficulties * Passengers ferried to dry land where they continued their tour  A cruise ship which made headlines when a pensioner was killed by a freak wave ran aground with almost 1,000 mainly British tourists on board, in sight of the pier where it was to be moored. And it's not the first occasion the ship has come into difficulties in Norwegian waters, with it also getting stranded back in March this year.  The 22,000 tonne MS Marco Polo was manoeuvring to drop anchor in high winds near Leknes in Norway's northern Lofoten Islands when it became lodged in soft mud, British owner Cruise & Maritime Voyages (CMV) said. Scroll down for video  The ship hit the headlines in February when James Swinstead, 85, was killed and several other people were injured when water crashed through restaurant windows as storms hit the English Channel. The 85 year old died 'almost instantly' after water rushed on board as it was battered by waves during severe storms. The 22,000-tonne vessel, operated by Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV), was heading for its home port of Tilbury in Essex at the end of a 42-night voyage when the incident happened on Valentine's Day. Water crashed through a window, injuring a number of the 735 passengers, who were mainly British. A female passenger in her 70s was airlifted off the ship, while 14 people were treated for minor injuries. Mr Swinstead, a father-of-two from Colchester, Essex, was on the cruise with his wife Helen, 82.  This time around, Marco Polo was chartered by Britain-based Cruise & Maritime Voyages and was cruising along Norway's fjords when it ran aground. The ship is currently on a 14-night voyage to Norway and the Land of the Northern Lights with 763 passengers, CMV said. The ship was freed after an operation at high tide at about 7.30pm, a spokesman said, adding: 'There has been no oil pollution arising out of the incident and none of the 763 mainly British passengers or crew have been injured.  'Passengers wishing to go ashore were transferred by tender and the local tour programme continued as scheduled.' He added that divers had found no damage upon inspecting the ship's hull and propulsion system.  Chris Coates, CMV's commercial director, said: 'We are doing everything we can to ensure that Marco Polo can resume her itinerary and remain confident that she will continue to operate her Northern Lights cruise as planned. 'The comfort and safety of our passengers is our top priority. Our passengers have been fully updated of the situation.' Tickets for the northern cruise can cost up to £2,749 depending on the time of year, according to the CMV website. Resident Karl Roger Johnsen told Norwegian broadcaster NRK he thought the ship took a chance by sailing close to the rocky coast on its way into the quay. The same liner also ran aground briefly in a nearby archipelago in March, according to Norwegian media. The cause of that incident remained unclear.  The Marco Polo was originally built as the Aleksandr Pushkin in East Germany in 1965 and later sold off after the collapse of the Soviet Union. To enable the ship to navigate through broken ice, The ship was constructed with greater hull strength and stability than usual in passenger ships of this size.  Are you a passenger on the ship? If so, please call Sam Webb on 0203 615 1679 or e-mail sam.webb@mailonline.co.uk "

On the trail of the northern lights,Norway,"Man alive, it’s cold. It’s 9pm, midwinter on the Barents Sea. The thermometer tucked behind the observation deck of the MS Polarlys says it is -18C but we are doing 15 knots, so the wind chill makes it feels like -29C. When I take off my gloves to get a tissue from my pocket, the wind cuts like a scalpel straight through my flesh to the bone. Although my face is so frozen that it feels anaesthetised I am otherwise comfortable, thanks to a genius quilted jacket I bought on the internet. It’s called a Nanok and was designed for use by Norwegian special forces — glamorous it is not, but at least my bum is toasty. I am on the Polarlys on a four-night northern lights-hunting trip around the northern tip of Norway. Whenever the aurora borealis deigns to put in an appearance, passengers are alerted over the Tannoy. Trouble is, I’ve just discovered that clambering into my ski trousers and boots and Nanok and two pairs of gloves takes a good few minutes and by the time I’m suited and booted and on deck the show is over. Damn. I boarded the ship in Tromso, 220 miles inside the Arctic Circle, Norway’s most northerly city and a brilliant little place. The wood-clad houses, clustered along the banks of a handsome fjord, are painted an assortment of mustard yellow, falu red, citrus orange and Nordic blue. There’s also some striking modern architecture, not least the Arctic Cathedral, which dominates the shoreline opposite the main street, where there’s a good array of shops, restaurants and coffee shops. When I arrive in the city at the end of January, there is a bustle to the place. People seem quite skittish. It’s hardly surprising — the sun reappeared above the horizon only four days earlier. The Tromsonians have been in total darkness for two months, and daylight has had the same effect as catnip on a cat. By 6.30pm, the time the Polarlys casts off, the sun is long gone, having set five hours earlier. The short hours of daylight limit the scope for excursions off the ship so it’s a relief to find that the Polarlys is very comfortable, if not exactly plush. The cabins are compact and don’t have TV or wi-fi, but they’re warm and homely enough for a short break, with an en suite shower. And the public spaces are nicely welcoming (even if the soft furnishings are a bit 1996): there’s a bar, restaurant and café, mahogany panelling everywhere and bits of Norwegian modern art dotted about. In truth, the Polarlys is more of a ferry than a cruise ship. While it is packed with northern lights watchers, it’s also a maritime bus service for the communities along Norway’s northern coast. The Hurtigruten line has been operating this route, from Bergen on the west coast round to Kirkenes in the northeast, since 1893. This link to the outside world allows 75,000 hardy souls to continue to live in Finnmark, the region that stretches from east of Tromso to the Russian border. They used to be fishermen; now there is petrochemical money flowing into these communities as the opening up of oil and gas fields in the seas north of Norway kickstarts shore-based service industries. The docking procedure at each port of call is so seamless that sometimes you barely register that the Polarlys has tied up. We are in and out of the smaller harboursin 15 minutes. By the time we reach Honningsvag the next morning, the stop nominated for the day’s excursions, we have already called in through the night at Skjervoy, Oksfjord, Hammerfest and Havoysund, dropping off locals, cars and freight through a door in the port side. Honningsvag is the stop nearest to the North Cape, which claims to be the most northerly point in mainland Europe: given that it’s on an island, you have to admire its chutzpah. Marking the point where the Atlantic meets the Barents Sea, it’s only 1,300 miles from the North Pole. The oppressive blanket of thick grey cloud on the 1,000ft cliffs feels as though it’s within touching distance. A fierce wind makes my eyes sting and nose run, and seeps inside my ski trousers. A blanket of cold air has wrapped itself round my legs, and it takes hours to warm up. The cloud precludes any aurora-spotting later that evening, which means that my fellow passengers and I (it’s a compact ship — a maximum of 619 passengers, most of whom are chatty and friendly) can enjoy dinner without waiting for the PA message that causes a mini stampede towards the decks. My trip is full board and, thankfully, the food is good. The menu is very Norwegian and even lunch buffet dishes such as lasagne are given a Nordic twist. It’s hearty: our first dinner is cauliflower soup, baked char and then Martha’s knipe — an oat-based moussey affair served with blueberry coulis. Next night, there is an Arctic buffet with huge platters of crayfish, Kamchatka king crab, smoked salmon, marinated Greenland halibut, prawns and mussels. And deep-fried cod’s tongues which are, I’m told, “gelatinous”. For meat-eaters there is reindeer stew. The next stop is Kirkenes, which is right on the Russian border so all the road signs are dual language, with Cyrillic translations. This is where the Polarlys turns and heads back south to Bergen – the whole round trip takes 12 days. I’m going snowmobiling, the wisdom of which I question when I find myself paired with a Dutch biker called Hannes and we’re whipping down an inlet of the Barents Sea at 55mph. But as the pillion passenger I get to take in the snowy splendour and also the dead reindeer, one with half of its body eaten away. While it looks like some grotesque Damien Hirst piece it is actually the work of a lynx, our guide, Ulf, tells us. Ulf also delivers some good news: the weather is improving, the cloud cover is breaking up and the northern lights are predicted to appear that evening. At last! A few hours later I am taking no chances: after dinner I get into full aurora-watching gear, and can then do nothing except lie on my bed for fear of overheating. But when the call comes I am up on deck in 30 seconds. I had anticipated the classic aurora borealis: “Great curtains of delicate light . . . pale green and rose pink, and as transparent as the most fragile fabric . . . they swung and shimmered loosely with more grace than the most skilful dancer”, as Philip Pullman describes them in Northern Lights. But the skyscape that greets me is an indistinct silvery grey and looks almost like backlit cloud. Which is what I convince myself it is until a vertical plume rises from it. Like a length of silk caught on the lightest of breezes, the aurora twists and turns imperceptibly. It’s more of a waft than a dance. So subtle is the movement that you feel as though nothing is happening at all — until you look away for just a few seconds and the vista changes markedly. As pale and slow-moving as they are, these are the real thing and people are desperate to capture a photograph, which proves beyond us all. With cameras hastily set flashes are firing, which illuminates the sea spray and odd snow flurry, making it looking as though we are caught in a glitter storm. Even such a languid version of the aurora, though, is bewitching. It keeps me entranced for the full 45 minutes of its display. I’ll go back one day to see the full, vivid, take-your-breath-away show. Northern lights, I’m not done with you yet.

Capturing carbon at the edge of the world,Norway,"LONGYEARBYEN, NORWAY -- Mine 7 is a broad black smear across the pure white Arctic wilderness that surrounds the world's most northern town. For more than a century, tonnes of coal carved out of the mountain face have fuelled the furnaces that generate electricity for this community of 2,000 people. The power plant's towering smokestack spews out a steady, grey cloud that falls as soot. Mixed with coal dust from the mine, it turns snow black. It is a stain not just on the landscape, but on the reputation Norway prefers to project to the world of a green nation leading international efforts against climate change. Coal has been part of life in Longyearbyen since the turn of the 20th century. American industrialist John Longyear came here in 1906 to mine the fossilized carbon left from prehistoric forests that once covered what is now the Svalbard archipelago. Coal is still the easiest source of power and heat this far north. Experts at University Centre in Svalbard, the world's most northern university, think they have the perfect alternative: capture carbon dioxide from the coal plant's smokestack, bury it deep beneath the permafrost, and make Longyearbyen a carbon neutral showcase. ""This is the only coal-fired power plant in Norway, so it's something we're not really proud about,"" says Sebastian Sikora, managing director of the UNIS project. ""The idea is just to cut the carbon-dioxide emissions from this chimney."" As a concept, carbon capture and storage is backed by the International Panel on Climate Change, the body of leading international scientists assessing the impact of global warming. Researchers say the technology was proved long ago. But building demonstration projects costs billions of dollars and requires government subsidies in numerous countries, including Canada. Large-scale carbon capture and storage can't make economic sense until governments put a price on carbon pollution, says Howard Herzog, a senior research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""You need to create a market,"" he adds. Governments can do that in a variety of ways, including a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system that sets limits on emissions and provides economic incentives for companies. The World Bank is leading a United Nations push to put a price on carbon, and has won the support of 74 countries, representing 54 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and more than half the world's gross domestic product. More than 1,000 companies and investors have also signed on. So have British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec. But the Harper government refuses to back the World Bank's carbon pricing campaign. At least 18 projects to capture and store carbon have been announced in 13 countries, including Canada, China, Norway and the U.S., according to the MIT program tracking the technology. ""Unfortunately, most projects in the pipeline are not getting out of the pipeline,"" Herzog says. ""They've been dying recently."" Saskatchewan started the world's first commercial-scale carbon and capture storage facility on Oct. 2 as part of a new coal-fired power plant. The cost is expected to exceed $1.4 billion. SaskPower, which is owned by the province, received a $240-million federal subsidy for the Boundary Dam project. The goal is to capture one million tonnes of carbon a year, which the company says is the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the roads. The world's second major carbon capture operation is going up in Kemper County, Miss. The cost has ballooned from a planned $2.7 billion to $6.3 billion. The plant's opening has been postponed to next May. Both the Canadian and American plants expect to make money selling some of the captured carbon dioxide to oil companies. They want to inject the gas into oil wells to increase the amount of crude forced to the surface, locking most of the carbon dioxide deep underground. The process is called enhanced oil recovery. The federal government, criticized internationally for lagging on Canada's commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, has spent more than $580 million on carbon capture and storage research and development. As well, the Alberta government and Ottawa have poured $865 million into an estimated $1.35-billion Shell project to capture carbon dioxide emissions from upgrading oilsands bitumen into synthetic crude. Set to start operating next year, the Quest project is designed to capture up to 35 per cent of carbon dioxide produced at the Scotford Upgrader, outside Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton. Once the greenhouse gas is compressed into a dense fluid, it will be pumped through a pipeline running 60 kilometres north of Fort Saskatchewan. There it will be injected into three special wells, down into porous rock more than two kilometres underground. Yet the expensive technology's future isn't bright in Alberta under new Premier Jim Prentice, who was Harper's former environment minister. Prentice announced in early October that he won't spend more tax dollars supporting carbon capture and storage, calling it ""a science experiment."" In Longyearbyen, up to 30,000 tonnes of coal is burned each year to produce electricity and heat. The current plant was built in 1983 and frequently breaks down under the increasing load as Longyearbyen becomes a bigger draw for tourists, scientists and university students. Six diesel generators kick in when the town needs backup power. The project to capture and store carbon dioxide from the plant started in 2007. It's stalled at the fourth and final stage, while politicians debate what to do with the coal-fired facility, which is too old and dirty for modern equipment. Climate change scientists warn that there's little time left for sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions if they're to have a significant impact on global warming. In Longyearbyen, there is added urgency. Two years ago, an early-morning fire erupted in the coal-fired plant. The blaze was quickly extinguished, so the plant shutdown was short. Authorities said there was enough diesel stockpiled to keep the town running on generator power for 18 days. If the Arctic wind had picked up and fanned the flames, if fire had knocked out the control room, or if colder weather had struck, the emergency would have been much more severe. It could have forced a complete evacuation of the world's most northern town. In a town where surviving extremes is a matter of pride, residents had dodged a bullet."

For decades now, the world has been on the move: last year, according to the United Nations Population Fund, the number of people living outside their country of origin reached 232 million - 50% more than in 1990. That may feel like a lot of people; in fact, it represents just 3.2% of the world's population. They are, however, unevenly spread: 60% live in the developed world, including 72 million in Europe, 71 million in Asia and 53 million in North America. Nearly two-thirds of migrants currently living in the developed world came from a developing country. Logically, the developed world is also where international immigrants represent a larger proportion of the total population: 10.8%, against just 1.6% in developing regions. Migrants, for example, now make up 9.8% of the total population in Europe, 14.9% in North America, and more than 20% in Oceania. But it seems migration patterns are shifting. While more people still settle in developed countries than in developing, the growth rate is now higher in the latter: 1.8% against 1.5%. Also, overall migration is slowing. From 2000 to 2010, 4.6 million people left their home country each year; that number is now 3.6 million. But migration and its effects, real or perceived, remain one of the defining political and social issues of the day. In Britain and the US, the subject - anti-immigration; Ukip's onward march; Barack Obama's decision to give up to 5 million immigrants work permits - dominates national debate. But what about elsewhere in the world? Is everyone as obsessed by immigration? Jon Henley Russia: Despite a big immigrant population, there are no ethnic enclaves: Hop on a metro train in Moscow or visit a market in any of Russia's major cities and faces from Central Asia and the Caucasus will be everywhere. According to United Nations figures, Russia has more immigrants than any other country in the world, save the United States, with about 11 million foreigners living in the country at any one time and a large grey labour market. Immigrants have been responsible for the lion's share of the construction and other work that has taken place during Vladimir Putin's presidency, when, at least until recently, high oil prices fuelled a building boom. Much of the immigration to Russia is from countries that were once part of the Soviet Union and have suffered economic decline since its collapse. Whole villages in mountainous Tajikistan empty of their menfolk each summer as hundreds of thousands travel to Russia to work on construction sites and do other menial jobs. Partly because many of the immigrant communities are transient and temporary, and partly because of active government policies to prevent it, Moscow's enormous migrant population has never translated into ethnic districts. There is no Southall or Chinatown here; no part of the city to go to for Central Asian plov or Caucasian khinkali dumplings. Instead, the migrant populations are spread around the city; a small intellectual class that is more or less integrated into Russian life, and an underclass of labourers who live in makeshift housing on construction sites or in cheap hostels. The low living standards and the bureaucratic hurdles that make it impossible for many migrants to work without paying bribes has led to tension and mistrust among Russians. A survey over the summer for the Levada polling agency found that 76% of Russians felt the number of immigrants should be restricted, and just 12% said they had a positive opinion of migrants from the south Caucasus. Occasionally these latent tensions bubble over into violence, most notably last year in the Moscow suburb of Birulyovo, where riots broke out after a Russian football fan was killed by a migrant from Azerbaijan. Even Alexei Navalny, the great hope of Moscow's liberal classes, has disturbingly nationalist views. Navalny says he merely wants to see visas introduced for the former Soviet republics, but in his earlier years he appeared in videos comparing migrant workers to cockroaches. The government has tried to tread a careful line between exploiting and reining in nationalist sentiment, but there are few conscious efforts to improve the lot of unskilled migrants. In 2005, nationalist politician Dmitry Rogozin released a campaign video with the slogan: ""Let's clean the rubbish away from Moscow."" It was clear that migrant workers were the rubbish, pictured speaking bad Russian and leering at a blonde Russian woman. Even in Russia, the video was controversial, but what might have been career-ending for a politician in another country, only boosted Rogozin's ratings. He is now the deputy prime minister. Shaun Walker Sweden, Denmark and Norway: Scandinavia's liberal attitude is being tested by the far right: We tend to think of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, collectively, as liberal, progressive social democracies, but they have traditionally had quite different approaches to immigration. The region has more immediate and significant challenges to face - productivity stagnation and increased inequality (Denmark), a slumping oil price (Norway) and an ageing population (Sweden) - but anti-immigration parties across the region have skilfully exploited the concerns of predominantly lower-income groups to reap huge dividends in the polls. Thus immigration has been the most significant political issue in Scandinavia for more than a decade. Norway is one of the world's most generous donors of foreign aid, but is generally considered the least welcoming in the region towards immigrants. Actually, in 2013 Norway was second only to Sweden in the per capita number of refugees it welcomed (the largest number from Eritrea, followed by Somalia and Syria), but things have changed dramatically since the election that year, after which the rightwing Progress party - of which Anders Behring Breivik was a former member - was admitted into the ruling coalition for the first time. Its leader, Siv Jensen, a vocal Islamophobe, was appointed finance minister. Today, Norway is deporting people at a record rate: more than 7,000 this year. In Denmark, next year's election is expected to bring a record vote for the far right Danish People's party (it won the highest number of votes in the recent European elections). This is not the first time the party has tasted success: it was the powerbroker in the right-leaning government for the first decade of the 21st century, and forced through numerous controversial immigration laws, largely to prevent family repatriation. In Denmark, ""immigrant"" is often conflated with ""Muslim"", while ""freedom of speech"" is commonly interpreted as ""freedom to insult Islam and other visible minorities"". This we saw with the Muhammad cartoon crisis of 2005/6, and again just last month in the exhibition in Copenhagen of Swedish artist Dan Parks's works depicting lynchings of local black leaders, which had been banned in his homeland. Sweden has long accepted more immigrants than any other Scandinavian country, and continues to do so: last year it admitted roughly 20% of all EU asylum seekers. This year it is predicting a record number of refugees will apply for asylum, the majority from Syria. The Swedish ruling class has long been a curious mix of fiercely progressive social democrats and rather murky industrialists (usually the bad guys in Swedish crime fiction). The former approve the open-door policy on grounds of compassion, but both public and private sectors feast on the cheap labour: Sweden's economy has consistently outperformed Denmark's over the past decade. Meanwhile, a compliant media has sidelined anti-immigration voices, leading to accusations of self-censorship (mostly from the Danes who have grown tired of Swedish sanctimony regarding the prominence of the Danish People's party). This kept the far-right out of the political mainstream for many years, but at the last general election in September, the Sweden Democrats - which has its origins in neo-nazism - won 13% of the vote, doubling its previous tally. The party's support is predominantly among working-class voters in the south. One final curiosity: all the Scandinavian rightwing parties offer what is to British eyes an improbable blend of xenophobia and an almost nostalgic social democratic affection for the welfare state. Imagine if, instead of wanting to privatise the NHS, Nigel Farage pledged to increase taxes to fund its expansion . . . Michael Booth Australia: Shaped by waves of migrants but now turning back the boat people: People turning up on boats. Nothing has played a greater role in defining Australia, in shaping the country's character, in directing its development. Nothing, now, is more controversial. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said earlier this year that the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia was the defining moment in the country's history. Yet he won election on a platform of promising to ""stop the boats"" of all asylum seekers. Australia has a curiously contradictory attitude towards migrants: at once welcoming and hostile, depending almost exclusively on mode of arrival. Fundamentally, Australia prides itself on being multicultural. It is a nation of immigrants. One in four Australians was born overseas, and in nearly 20% of households, a language other than English is the dominant tongue. Net migration is forecast by the government to increase each year to 2017, the last year of projections. India and the UK provided nearly a third of new Australian citizens last year. The statistics are reflective of Australia's human history, essentially one of successive waves of migration. The arrival of Indigenous Australians, from Africa via Asia, between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago; the First Fleet convicts in 1788; postwar generations of ""populate or perish"" sponsored migrants; the dismantling of the White Australia Policy; the first ""unauthorised"" boat arrivals in the 1970s: Australia has been shaped, and irrevocably altered, by its migrants. But in 21st-century Australia, the vast bulk of the country's migration programme is barely discussed. Periodically, there are debates about whether the driest inhabited continent on earth can support a ""Big Australia"" of 35 million, or discussions of guest worker programmes for Pacific Islanders. But essentially Australia talks only of asylum seekers and refugees. Australia displays a divided attitude towards those seeking asylum. Those resettled in Australia through the government's humanitarian programme are seen as ""deserving"" refugees, welcomed and supported. Those who arrive unannounced by boat are condemned as ""illegals"" and ""queue jumpers"". This is despite most boat arrivals coming from Burma, Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka, countries where there are no refugee queues. And it is despite the fact that there are now fewer places in the queue: at the same time as stopping the boats, Australia has cut its refugee resettlement intake by almost a third, from 20,000 to 13,750 people a year. The government says its self-proclaimed ""hardline"" policies against boat arrivals are based on a humanitarian rationale, designed to stop drownings at sea, to ""break the people smugglers' business model"", and to protect Australia from ""threats to its national security"". But more than 90% of those arriving by boat are found to be genuine refugees, requiring Australia's protection. And their numbers - save for a significant spike in 2012 and 2013 - have generally been fewer than 1% of Australia's total migrant intake. However, the policy on its most fundamental level is successful. Boats are no longer coming. Australia is one of only five jurisdictions in the world known to forcibly push asylum-seekers' boats back to sea. Those that reach Australia are taken out of the country, held in prison-like camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, where instances of self-harm, disease and violent physical and sexual assault are common. The average length of detention is 426 days. Australia also incarcerates asylum-seeker children without charge. Currently, more than 600 are in detention. Ben Doherty India: Terror and security fears have made migration a potent issue: It was dusk in early November when the suicide bomber struck Wagah, the only land crossing between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan, killing at least 55 people. India's orange-turbaned border guards and their black-clad Pakistani counterparts had already lowered both country's flags in a display of goose-stepping nationalism attended daily by spectators. Due to tight security, the bomber blew himself up a few hundred metres from the actual gate separating the two countries. But for India, it was close enough to serve as a potent reminder of how vulnerable it is to terrorist infiltration. Six years ago, Pakistani nationals carried out the Mumbai attacks in which more than 150 people were killed. Terror and security issues have largely driven India's immigration policy. India's 2,300km border with Pakistan is fenced and so brightly floodlit it is visible from space. But increasingly, illegal migration and population pressures too are in play. In the east, along India's 3,360km border with Bangladesh, shoot on sight orders allow border guards to kill with impunity. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 1,000 people, including many children, have been killed by Indian border guards since 2000. Most victims are poor, landless farmers seeking a marginally better life in India. Migration is overwhelmingly undocumented. While the World Bank's official figures suggest a net outflow, estimates for the number of illegal immigrants run from 3 million to 20 million. And migration to the country is increasingly a potent religious and political issue. During the election campaign earlier this year, India's new Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, told a rally that ""these Bangladeshis better be prepared with their bags packed"" when he came to power. Meanwhile, he said, India should make space for Hindu migrants left behind when the British carved up the subcontinent in 1947. Hindus fled to India and Muslims to East and West Pakistan, with up to a million slaughtered. East Pakistan - now Bangladesh - gained its independence in 1971 in another bloody conflict. Ever since those partitions, migration within the region has remained a thorny emotional issue. But even garden-variety visitors to India hardly find a red carpet welcome. Despite Modi's economic charm offensive and encouragement for businesses to ""Make in India"", the regime for both business and tourist visas remains Kafkaesque. In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rating, India has actually fallen eight places to 139 out of 189 economies surveyed in 2014. Perhaps the most bizarre legacy of India's failure to forge a humane, coherent immigration policy, free from the hangovers of colonialism, lies in a tiny parcel of land called Dahala Khagrabari #51. It's a Bangladeshi jute field, completely encircled by an Indian village, which is itself entirely surrounded by Bangladeshi territory. Its inhabitants and those of a staggering 161 other such ""enclaves"", created in the chaotic aftermath of independence, are stateless and confined to their islands of terrain. India has ignored the problem for six decades, possibly on the assumption that the problem may eventually go away. Its immigration policy suffers from the same wilful blindness. Fencing people out might solve some problems. But the twin regional factors of poverty and climate change could see millions of people, particularly from Bangladesh, seeking sanctuary in India. At that point, New Delhi may have to look beyond barbed wire and bullets. Anu Anand Pakistan The war in Afghanistan has triggered a huge influx of refugees: Pakistan is home to one of the largest refugee populations in the world. The majority are Afghan refugees who began arriving after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and have continued in waves through the following decades of war. The UN says there are currently about 1.6 million refugees living in Pakistan, and in total they have helped repatriate 3.8 million Afghan refugees. The government, meanwhile, says there are another million Afghan refugees who are undocumented, while some experts place the total number of Afghan refugees closer to 4 million. In the sixth most populous country in the world, accurate figures are hard to come by. Junaid Arshad Khan from the International Organisation of Migration says the government only publishes daily figures for border crossings between the two countries - around 40,000 to 50,000 each day - but points out that many are daily migrants. Yet despite the high number of refugees, there is currently little national debate about immigration, according to Haris Gazdar from the Collective for Social Science Research: ""There have been similar debates to those in the west - with migrants linked to crime, and a draw-down on resources. But at the moment that has died down and there is not a serious debate about repatriation or immigration policy in general."" The lack of debate is partly because many Afghan refugees live in areas where they have strong ethnic and cultural links to the local population. But Sanaa Alimia, an academic who researches Afghan refugees, says there has been a growing hostility in recent years - and this normally comes from people at government level. She says she has come across mass arrests and harassment of refugees as a way to ""encourage"" them to be repatriated. And she points out that only Afghan refugees who are registered can access services - from education and housing to healthcare - and have protection against repatriation or arrest. Although many refugees arrived decades ago, few become citizens unless they marry into the local population. The more than a million people who are internally displaced by military operations against militants and natural disasters are part of the debate about immigration, says Alimia. But other smaller populations of migrants from elsewhere in south Asia - or skilled workers from China - are seldom mentioned. Meanwhile more than 4 million Pakistanis are migrants to countries including India, Saudi Arabia and the UK - and remittances from abroad make up 5.7% of the country's GDP. Homa Khaleeli Spain: The economic crisis means more people are leaving than arriving: In Spain, the discussion regarding migrants arriving in the country has been overshadowed by worries about the number of people leaving. Fifteen years ago, immigrants from Ecuador, Bolivia, Romania and Morocco drove the immigrant population in the country from less than 2% in 1999 to 12% in 2009, but today many of these same migrants are leaving. In the face of an unemployment rate that hovers around 24%, many of Spain's migrants are heading home, joining the exodus of Spaniards hoping to find better job opportunities abroad. Spain became a net exporter of people in 2010; last year some 550,000 people left while 250,680 migrated to the country, primarily from Morocco, Romania and the UK. The figures, from the National Statistics Institute, are not exact, only reflecting the number of people who have registered with local authorities in their municipality; many foreigners have taken their name off municipal rolls to avoid a new requirement to declare assets located abroad. The economic crisis has led the number of Latin American migrants to drop off considerably in recent years, says Joaquin Arango, a professor of sociology at Madrid's Complutense University. Increasingly taking their place are migrants from China, who see business opportunities in the crisis. Compared with many other European countries, there has been less rejection of migration in Spain, says Arango. ""Even after seven years of economic crisis, we haven't seen any kind of generalised backlash."" The explanation, he says, lies in the country's transition to democracy after more than three decades of dictatorship. ""The values associated with democracy - anti-racism, equality - became entrenched."" He points to remarks by David Cameron in 2011 urging the British public to report illegal immigrants. ""In Spain this would be unthinkable."" Those who work with immigrants worry that this attitude is slowing eroding, says Mikel Araguas, of Andalucia Acoge (Welcome Andalusia), a non-profit group dedicated to helping immigrants integrate. As Spain suffers harsh austerity measures, migrants are increasingly being seen as competitors for the scarce social resources, says Araguas. ""We're starting to see a discourse that seeks to criminalise immigration, with some media asking whether these groups pay taxes or whether they're scamming social services."" Food banks run by far-right groups and who serve only needy Spanish nationals have sprouted across the country, while in the Basque country, the mayor of Vitoria has railed against Algerians and Moroccans, accusing them of taking advantage of social benefits. In September, Araguas's group formalised its efforts to fight back, launching a project called Stop Rumours. Tackling the most commonly heard stereotypes, such as migrants being a burden on the country's healthcare system or that they are taking all the jobs, the project's website offers videos and statistics to dispel the myths. More than 300 people have signed up for the group's workshops, intended to give people the tools to counter this discourse. The stereotypes have rapidly gained strength in the absence of little public debate over immigration, says Araguas. Instead, he says, the conversation focuses on the borders at the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, where migrants spend months living rough in the hope of rushing the border fence that separates Morocco from Spain. ""It's an element that's very visual but a perversion of migration in the country."" Some 14,000 people rushed the fence last year, with 2,000 making it in; a minuscule drop in the bucket compared with Spain's 4.6 million immigrants. Still, the border fences have become the flashpoint of the debate over migrants in Spain, with human rights groups, the European Union and United Nations expressing concerns about Spain's actions, while the Spanish government pushes forward, fortifying the triple fence and covering it with anti-climbing mesh. It's a futile debate in a country that has become a net exporter of people, says Araguas. Ashifa Kassam South Africa: Well-educated Zimbabwean migrants are much sought after: South Africa is among the biggest recipients of refugees in the world. Yet the issue remains surprisingly marginal in political discourse. When President Jacob Zuma delivered his state-of-the-nation address to parliament in June, its more than 29,000 words did not mention immigration once. This is despite an official unemployment rate of 25.4%, alleged mistreatment of asylum seekers in detention and frequent explosions of xenophobic violence, notably in 2008 when 62 people, including 21 South Africans, were killed and more than 150,000 displaced. Immigration figures are notoriously imprecise. South Africa's 2011 census says 3.3% - or about 1.7 million - of the country's 51.8 million population are ""non-South African"" citizens. Data collated by the World Bank and the UN suggest a migrant population of about 1.86 million. But the number of undocumented or illegal migrants is unknown. A total of 108,711 applications for temporary and permanent residence were approved by the government in 2013. Two-thirds of these were from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, China, India, Pakistan, the UK, Lesotho and Angola. ""Most of these people bring skills into the country,"" statistician-general Pali Lehohla said earlier this year. There are also asylum seekers: media reports often describe South Africa as the world's largest recipient. But an investigation by the Africa Check website found the evidence to be ""flawed, inaccurate and sharply contradictory"", while Amnesty International has said it understands that nine out of 10 applications are rejected. Newspaper proprietor Trevor Ncube, harassed at an airport after a business trip in 2012, tweeted: ""It's time South African immigration stopped assuming every black African coming into the country is a desperate criminal."" Neighbouring Zimbabwe is easily the biggest source after more than a decade of political and economic turmoil under President Robert Mugabe. Estimates of the number of Zimbabweans in South Africa vary wildly from 1.5 million to 3 million. Coming from a country with the highest literacy rate in Africa, they are often sought after by employers as nannies, security guards or waiters on low pay, prompting some South Africans to accuse them of ""stealing jobs"". Meanwhile, Somalis, fleeing 20 years of civil war, have carved a reputation as traders. A 2012 report by the City Press newspaper quoted residents of a township near Cape Town as saying Somali traders are cheaper, friendlier, trade from 5am to 10pm and extend small amounts of credit to regular customers. This has provoked a deadly backlash from local shop owners who feel their territory under threat. But far from exploiting this anger for political gain, Zuma recently chided South Africans for failing to match immigrants' entrepreneurial spirit. ""Our people are waiting for government,"" he told a media gathering in Pretoria last month. ""Our people are not used to standing up and doing things. These ones [foreigners] are not expecting any government to do anything so they get here, see opportunities and exploit them. They have taken over your small businesses."" If he were a journalist, Zuma added, he would write to South Africans to say ""wake up"".

"Well, hello, neighbour. Just call me Erik and spend all my money",Norway,"You wouldn't believe what it's like these days in Norway. I spent some time last weekend in Oslo and there was no dirt or grime of any kind. The roads gleamed with a shimmering newness, not a single bulb in a single thing wasn't working and every barrier to every private car park rose like a saluting US marine. At Thief Island, a regenerated district in the centre of the city, everything was sparkling and wondrous. All the buildings were sharp and cool and edged with a blue LED brilliance, and yet the materials used to make them all put you in mind somehow of Whitby's olde worlde centre. It's the best modern architecture I have seen. And that's before we get to the hotel at which I was staying. The manager was the Duracell bunny. He served the drinks, checked you in, never went to bed and was always smiling the smile of a truly content man. Outside, there was a kindergarten, and outside that were rows and rows of mini scooters and trikes, all brand new and all paid for by the government. State kindergartens are now so good in Norway that the private alternatives are resorting to madness to compete. One even offers gourmet food andlessons in how to gut fish. For four-year-olds. Big school is obviously even better. Because every single restaurant is staffed by people who speak 43 languages and know everything. In one a girl who was so beautiful I kept fainting leant over at one point to explain that my understanding of the Northern Ireland assembly was incorrect. And I checked later. She was right. There'd be no point screening a Norwegian version of Alexander Armstrong's quiz show, because how would you be able to find a pointless answer in a country where the random selection of 100 people would know everything. It's not just education and aesthetics, either. The healthcare system is so good that no one has died in Norway since 1982. The reason all this is possible is tax. I've done some research and it seems that there are many layers of complex structures that mean everyone gives about 102% of what they earn to the government. Unless they earn more than £300,000, in which case they pay about 150%. Then there's VAT, which means everything costs about a million pounds. Apart from cars, which are ten million pounds. It's odd. Deep-veined socialism doesn't work when it comes in jackboots or fur hats. But dress it up in a sturdy white polo-neck jumper and it seems to be brilliant. Especially when it's mainly fuelled by oil. In various Middle Eastern countries that sit on reservoirs of the black gold, the money earned goes straight to the royal family, who spend it on yachts and watches. In Russia it goes to John Terry and Gary Cahill, and in Britain and America it goes to the shareholders of the oil companies. But in Norway the biggest oil company is 67% owned by the state. So it gets the revenue from that, in addition to every penny everyone earns, as well as £200m every time a tourist buys a beer, and the upshot is simple. If you ignore various weird fiefdoms such as Qatar and Luxembourg, along with Singapore, Norway is the richest country in the world. So. Why can't we do that here? Well, here's the thing. Would you trust your MP to run a gigantic oil company? No, really. It's a tricky business, with all the refining and shipping and negotiating at complicated international meetings, and I'm not sure you'd entrust that to a man who got his job simply because he has a ready smile and nice hair. Let's not forget, shall we, that Gordon Brown spent all day as chancellor poring over the books, yet somehow he sold more than half our gold reserves when prices were at rock bottom. And it'd be the same story if we put an MP in charge of our oil. And then what? How do you find him to express your disappointment? Do you know his name? Do you know where he lives? Do you even know if he's a he? This is the great thing about small countries such as Norway. The chances are you were at school with the prime minister, and that you live next door to the chap in charge of transport. So if you run over a pothole on your way home, you can pop round and ask him to fix it. This means the politicians are truly accountable. They know that if they have taken all of your money, they had damn well better do a good job when it comes to spending it. Or you're going to poke them in the eye at the supermarket next weekend. That can't happen in a country with a population the size of ours, because I'm willing to bet you've never met an MP in your local supermarket. Or anywhere else. Which means they've never met you. Which means that they don't really care about your money. Which is why, when everything was nationalised here, nothing worked. The solution, then, would seem to be obvious: more devolved powers to the regions. Break Britain up into bite-sized chunks, because that way you will have a greater chance of knowing the man who's entrusted to spend your cash. That all sounds very sensible until you look at, oh, I don't know, let's say Tower Hamlets, or Rotherham. These are local councils run by local people, and do they work well? Are they efficient? Would you trust your local councillor to get the oil from under the North Sea and then achieve the best price at the market? No. And neither would I. Because I don't know his name either. This is the root of the problem, really. Recent figures suggest that about 70% of people in Britain do not know their neighbours' surnames or what they do for a living. Which means that the only people we really know and can therefore trust with our earnings are our own families. Which is why the Norwegian system couldn't work here. Because in our hearts we don't want to pay any tax at all."
Russian tourists not canceling bookings in Estonia yet,Norway,"TALLINN, Dec 17, BNS – The decline of the ruble has not made Russian tourists massively cancel their bookings in Estonian hotels for the New Year holiday but new sales have been affected, spokespeople at several Tallinn hotels told BNS. ""Bookings for the New Year are secured with a non-refundable fee, hence there will be no cancelations,"" Vitali Makejev, marketing director of Radisson Blu hotel, told BNS. He added that a negative effect could be observed in new bookings. ""Until a few weeks ago orders and inquiries kept coming. During last week and this week the hotel has received no orders from Russia for the New Year. It's very difficult to say what next year will bring because declining oil prices are affecting not Russia alone but also Norway, speaking of nearby markets,"" Makejev said. Peep Ehasalu, spokesman for Sokos Hotel Viru, said that while there were no massive cancelations yet, the number of bookings from Russia was smaller than last year. ""The rapid decline of the exchange rate of the ruble is aggravating processes and if the decline continues it's possible that there will be more cancelations in the coming days. Judging by the latest news the decline has come to a halt, apparently everybody in the Estonian tourism sector is keeping a closer eye on news about the Russian economy than before,"" he said. Ehasalu pointed to a change in the way customers were putting together their New Year holiday package. Where earlier travel agencies used to buy packages consisting of accommodation and a New Year party at the same hotel, now a bigger number of visitors have decided to party elsewhere and the hotel is getting more inquiries from locals about the possibility to buy tickets to a New Year party. The manager of Go Hotel, Hanna Kilumets, said Go Hotel has received fewer group bookings than earlier and its sales via Russian travel agencies have been smaller. The number of bookings canceled is not bigger than usual, however. Tallinn newsroom, +372 610 8823, majandus@bns.ee Baltic News Service"
"Air travel: the low-frills, long-haul gamble",Norway,"The destinations are unremarkable: New York, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale. But, if successful, the gamble Norwegian Air Shuttle is taking would transform the business model for long-haul travel. From last winter, passengers boarding one of the airline's Boeing Dreamliners at Copenhagen have been able to fly direct to these US cities using tickets half the price offered by larger rivals. Europe's third-biggest budget airline is not the first to bet on a low-cost long-haul business: think Sir Freddie Laker in the 1970s and more recently Air Asia. But Norwegian believes the advent of a new generation of fuel-efficient aircraft - shrinking a fuel bill that can account for up to half an airline's operating costs - makes the enterprise viable. ""It is key,"" says Bjorn Kjos, Norwegian chief executive, of the importance of the Dreamliner to his operation. ""We did our mathematics on other types of aircraft and it couldn't add up."" The fall in oil prices since the summer will help the calculation, although many airlines hedge their spending on fuel. But Norwegian has also incurred millions in costs stemming from problems with the Dreamliner, and Mr Kjos says it is too early to say whether the technical problems are over. Stretching the low-cost modelto profitably operate intercontinental flights would open a new chapter in aviation. ""The low-cost model, short-haul, has been so phenomenally successful that on the surface it seems an obvious idea to apply that model in long-haul,"" says James Stamp, global head of aviation at KPMG. ""There have been a number of unsuccessful attempts, as structural reasons make replicating the model difficult. ""But if someone could crack it and establish a niche, the example set by the low-cost carriers that started early is that they have tended to become dominant and hard to displace."" The original budget operators such as the US carrier Southwest Airlines in the 1970s, and then Ryanair and easyJet in Europe in the 1990s, revolutionised short haul air travel - making flying suddenly affordable for millions of people. The model of selling cheap air fares was a winner and the rapid growth of the new kids on the block rocked the established players, luring away their customers and forcing them to slash costs in response. Some are hoping to have a similar impact in the long-haul end of the business. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's combative chief executive, has made no secret of his desire to offer rock-bottom fares across the Atlantic, if only the aircraft could be bought at a price that would make an attractive deal. ""There is an opportunity for someone to do a transatlantic, low fares airline in long-haul,"" says Mr O'Leary. ""We'd be very interested in doing it, if I could get some long-haul fleet cheaply."" For it to work, he believes a fleet of dozens of aircraft would be needed to link US cities with parts of Europe. However, analysts suggest the fact that the Ryanair boss has not yet done it speaks volumes for how difficult the long-haul market is. Norwegian Air, launched just over 20 years ago, has invested huge sums in the past year on a fleet of seven Dreamliners, which will rise to 17 by 2018. The list price of a 787-8 used by Norwegian is $218.3m, although typically airlines secure a substantial discount. The operation on the ground looks anything but revolutionary. At Copenhagen airport, a 787 rests by a terminal as maintenance crew bustle through the aircraft. Inside, 32 grey padded seats make up a premium cabin, with 259 less upholstered seats further back. Aside from Copenhagen, Norwegian also runs long-haul flights out of Oslo, Stockholm and London Gatwick. The scale is small: at Gatwick there are two services a week to Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale, and three to New York. It is a similar picture in Oslo and Stockholm. The competition is daunting. British Airways alone flies 16 times a day out of London to New York. Norwegian's calculation is that it can make its long-haul service profitablein spite of widespread scepticism. The cost of flying an aeroplane from New York to London on a 787-9, the Dreamliner model Norwegian has on order, is roughly $90,000 one way, says one industry figure. That includes fuel, crew, maintenance, navigation and landing fees, ground handling and ownership or lease costs - but not sales, marketing, distribution, back office, other overheads or profit margin. Taxes and non-fuel charges are passed directly to the passenger. If that aircraft had 354 seats like the 787-9 and typical load factors - a measure of how full planes are - for low-cost airlines, a year-round average one-way airfare, including passenger ancillaries such as food and drink, would need to be about $340-$380 to earn a margin of about 4 per cent. Seat mile costs, another standard industry measure, on the smaller 787-8 are slightly higher, requiring an estimate of about 5 per cent more revenue. According to Mr Kjos, the Dreamliners each bring a 20 to 30 per cent fuel cost saving - close to $10m a year each - but the planes need to be put to work for up 18 hours a day to make the operation viable. With Norwegian pricing its transatlantic airfares out of London at around £300 return, compared with the £500-£600 offered by rivals, the scale of its low-cost ambition is so daring many doubt it can pull it off. ""This feels like yet another airline that starts up, has a go and runs out of money,"" said Gerald Khoo, an airline analyst at Liberum, a broker. It was unclear whether Norwegian's maths added up, he says, adding: ""I don't see how the Norwegian model is any different to lots of other airlines that have tried and failed."" The flamboyant British entrepreneur Laker was first to try transatlantic routes, launching at £59, not far off the average gross weekly wage in 1977. It was wildly popular with the public and the fare was well below the average £100 charged by rivals such as BA and PanAm. However, five years later Laker was bankrupt, the venture killed off by a declining economy, aircraft problems and competition. The following year low-cost US carrier People Express tested the transatlantic routes but imploded five years later, overstretched and hit by management problems. Three business class-only airlines, Silverjet and the US-based carriers MaxJet and Eos, all tried transatlantic routes before the companies folded between 2007 and 2008. But Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot, isnot alone in his bet on air travel. Lufthansa is also looking to set up a low-cost, long-haul operation. Chief executive Carsten Spohr said the no-frills service could run flights to holiday destinations such as the Seychelles or to cities in China from late 2015, as part of an overhaul at the airline to fend off low-cost and Middle Eastern carriers. So how close is Norwegian to profitability on its transatlantic routes? The operation is ""starting to stabilise"", says Mr Kjos, without giving any detail on when the routes will become profitable. Planes are running at about 80-90 per cent full on all routes, he says. Expansion is being mapped out. Paris, Barcelona and Rome are on the long-haul list, as part of Norwegian's strategy to target the tourist market. Traffic will be added on existing routes from 2016, when it is due to receive the 787-9s. He maintains that Norwegian will be able to retain its advantage even when rivals take delivery of their fuel-efficient aircraft, arguing it still has a lower cost base. ""If they lower fares, we know that will drive up volume. And then there will be enough for everybody."" Mr Kjos does admit its stab at low-cost long-haul might be too small initially to threaten the bigger airlines on the transatlantic routes. ""In order to fly a good set-up, you would need more Dreamliners, maybe twice as many."" But it is not just capacity that threatens the fledgling operation. Norwegian is locked in a dispute with US authorities over further flying rights despite an open-skies agreement with Europe. Pilot unions and rival airlines have railed against what they see as Norwegian's creative ways of squeezing out costs. The airline obtained an Irish operating licence which critics say is an attempt to sidestep Norway's high labour costs, while it is also employing cabin crew from Thailand. Meetings between EU and US officials have failed to break the deadlock, which means the airline cannot obtain the rights to operate US flights with its Irish licence. The unions argue that the short-term benefits of cheap tickets would come at the expense of the industry's long-term stability, driving down wages and standards. Labour is one-fifth of Norwegian's overall costs. Mr Kjos says rivals are afraid of competition and that the airline will operate flights out of Ireland - not just use the licence as a way to enter other markets. Norway is not an EU member so is not part of bilateral agreements between the EU and Asia, unlike Ireland. Also stacked against the Scandinavian airline's chances of success, critics say, is its rapid rate of expansion, in an echo of the undoing of those who have tried and failed before. What Norwegian is trying is ""monumentally difficult"", says Mr O'Leary, in simultaneously developing short and long-haul. ""While they're doing [long-haul] they've taken their eye off the ball in growing the short-haul business,"" he says, pointing to half-year results in July that took it into the red with operating losses before tax and interest of Nkr85m. The real opportunity, to build a low-cost, long-haul business is in Asia, say observers. ""If we look at the underlying view of how the market will develop in Europe, it will be inbound leisure traffic from Asia,"" said Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant. ""The growth markets are in China and south Asia."" While AirAsia is having some success in the region, the challenge for European carriers such as Norwegian is to build a profitable low-cost, long-haul model. In spite of the significant barriers to success, industry experts insist someone will manage to make the model work. As one analyst says: ""At some point someone is going to find ways around the complicated airline industry restrictions that still exist, in order to develop a lower-cost model on long-haul as well as short-haul."" *** Asia: Drop in oil boosts 'sexy proposition' for airlines A growing middle class has driven low-cost, long-haul air travel in Asia. Companies began testing the model in the mid-2000s with the creation of Jetstar, partly backedby Australian national airline Qantas and Malaysia's Air Asia. Analysts say the latter's Air AsiaX, Asia's largest low-cost airline, is in prime position, with an order book for 50 fuel-efficient A330-900neo aircraft, which carry 315 passengers. Ninety per cent of its growthis forecast to come within Asia, but London, Paris and Rome top its list as ""vanity routes"", says the airline's founder Tony Fernandes. Those routes will begin to be added when it takes delivery of its aircraft. Having a high number of passengers transfer from its short-haul flights has been essential, as has been a 12-seat premium cabin. ""This model will work, there's no doubt about it,"" says Mr Fernandes, despite having had to cut a previous initiative that ran routes to Paris and London in 2012, after a rise in fuel prices. ""This is an airline that could be not too far off what Emirates is doing [in terms of its reach]."" The optimism is based on the new aircraft cutting fuel and running costs but also the airline's strength in connecting passengers from its short-haul routes, and infrastructure such as the dedicated low-cost terminal at Kuala Lumpur. ""We have a huge opportunity to be one of the largest long-haul carriers in the business,"" says Mr Fernandes. ""The vision is to grow as quick as you can, being profitable, have a few bases around Asia and, combined with the short-haul flights, be able to dominate the space."" With oil languishing around $60 a barrel, he adds, the model has become even more of ""a sexy proposition"". His confidence comes in spite of overcapacity in the region. In an increasingly competitive market, Air Asia reported a third-quarter net loss of Rm210.9m in November and has reviewed its growth plans. Although in an experimental phase and with profitability uncertain, others in the region are dabbling in long-haul, among them Korean budget airline Jin Air and Singaporean-Thai venture NokScoot. Aviation consultancy OAG says a number of carriers are well positioned to step into the market. In China, the big three state-owned carriers - Air China, China Eastern and China Southern - have been able to keep low-cost competition at bay, with the aviation regulator banning the establishment of new carriers from 2007 to 2013. ""They [the state-owned trio] love the status quo,"" says a Hong Kong-based industry analyst who asked not to be named. ""They have an oligopoly that controls 80 per cent of the domestic market. Whenever times are bad, all they need to do is jack up ticket prices."" Additional reporting by Tom Mitchell in Beijing, Kana Inagaki in Tokyo and Jung-a Song in Seoul"
Revealed: The countries where British travellers get the biggest spending power boost as pound strengthens against 42 currencies in 2014,Norway,"* Pound has risen against 42 of 74 currencies in the last year * Travellers get 52% more Russian rouble and 12% more Japanese yen for their sterling than this time last year * Biggest gain of 77% was versus Ukrainian hryvnia * Scandinavia 10% cheaper for UK tourists after pound's gains against Norwegian krone and Swedish kroner * But expert warns pound faces 'headwinds' in the New Year  Trips abroad have become significantly cheaper for British tourists this year as strengthening economic conditions in the UK have helped the pound strengthen versus the majority of major currencies around the globe. Travellers heading far afield to Russia and Japan at the moment will get 52 per cent more roubles and 12 per cent more yen to the pound than they would have done a year ago. Adventurous sorts bound for Ukraine will get a 77 per cent better exchange rate than they had this time last year after domestic economic weakness and political uncertainty saw the hryvnia plunge against sterling during 2014. Perhaps more numerous are Brits heading to Scandinavia and traditionally expensive destinations like Norway and Sweden are now 10 per cent more affordable after the pound's gains against their currencies, research from Lloyds Bank Private Banking shows.  Scroll down for video  Since last December, the pound has increased in value against 42 of 74 major world currencies, with 10 of them declining in value by more than 10 per cent against sterling since 3 December 2013. Economic and political woe in a nation are usually behind a currency's loss of value and sure enough the pound strengthened against the Russian rouble, Argentinian peso and Japanese yen this year.  However, local price inflation in destinations like Russia and Argentina could wipe out some of the gains for visitors as the cost of living increases dramatically. Russia's economy has been rocked in recent months by a combination of sanctions and a plunging world oil price, while high inflation in Argentina and Venezuela has devalued their currencies. In Japan it has been the money-printing policies of the Abe administration aimed at firing up the stagnant economy that have kept the yen weak. The 77 per cent fall for the Ukrainian hryvnia and the 52 per cent drop for the Russian rouble will now be even more pronounced, as the data was collated at the start of the month and since then local crises have devalued the currencies further. The Argentine peso fell in value against the pound by 33 per cent. Closer to home, the Norwegian krone and Swedish krona have also recorded significant declines against sterling – both declining by a bit more than 10 per cent over the past year. The Norwegian currency has also suffered as a result of the fall in oil prices which has heightened concerns about the country's economic outlook. Both of these countries have substantially higher costs of living than Britain, so obtaining more currency for your pound is likely to please tourists heading out there. Richard Musty, international private bank director at Lloyds Bank, said: 'The relative strength of the UK economy has been a key factor driving the increase in value of the pound against the majority of currencies during 2014, which has been good news in terms of helping to keep UK inflation under tight control. 'Sterling's gains have been good news for many overseas travellers from the UK, including those going to Norway, Sweden and eurozone countries. 'They have, however, been less beneficial for many UK exporters who have found it more difficult to compete in a number of key export markets.' But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, believes sterling is set to meet 'headwinds' in the New Year. He says recent gains for sterling have been made because of expectations about interest rates rising in the near future - but these expectations have now frittered away. He said: 'This recent weakness in the pound could gain traction in the next few months.  'The two main drivers are likely to be the future path of US monetary policy, which at the moment could well see a tightening in the early part of next year, and the possibility of a change in the UK government at next year's General Election.'  Elsewhere, only one country gained more than 10 per cent against the pound – the Pakistani rupee, which is up 10.4 per cent in the year. The Libyan dinar up 7.5 per cent, Trinidad and Tobago dollar up 5.1 per cent and Indian rupee up five per cent are the next biggest gainers. Against currencies of the G20, after the Russian rouble and Argentine peso, the Japanese yen has fallen 11.8 per cent and the euro, with a drop of 5.6 per cent, have been the next biggest losers against the pound. These falls have been prompted by weakness in both the Japanese and eurozone economies. The yen has fallen to a seven-year low against the US dollar. The US dollar has recorded the second biggest rise – behind the Indian rupee – against sterling from the G20 currencies, gaining 4.3 per cent over the past 12 months. The dollar has generally strengthened on the currency markets as a result of relatively strong economic data over the past year. The Chinese yuan has also recorded a modest rise against sterling of three per cent."
Norwegian Businesses Lost $1.2Bln Due to Anti-Russia Sanctions – Trade Official,Norway,"MOSCOW, December 23 (Sputnik) - Norwegian companies have lost about 1 billion euros (slightly over 1.2 billion dollars) due to the Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its alleged involvement in the Ukrainian crisis, Russian trade representative in Norway Tamara Chernyshova told RIA Novosti Tuesday. ""The losses of the EU member states [incurred by the anti-Russia sanctions] amounted to 5 billion euros [slightly over 6 billion dollars]. Norway, which is not a member of the European Union, estimates its losses at 1 billion euros [1.2 billion dollars],"" Chernyshova said in an interview. The trade representative noted that despite the complicated situation caused by the imposition of Western sanctions, Norway's direct investment in Russian economy is surging. The total volume of the trade turnover has not been drastically affected either, she noted. ""We are continuing our inter-sector collaboration, including fisheries regulation, nuclear security cooperation, and we are getting ready for a tourism business forum, ""she added. The trade representative stressed that the anti-Russia sanctions had significantly affected cooperation in the energy sector, especially projects based in the Arctic. However, earlier in December, the CEOs of Russia's oil company Rosneft and Norway's state-owned energy giant Statoil agreed to maintain cooperation on projects in the Barents Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. Answering the question if an expected change in Statoil's leadership may affect the company's strategy toward cooperation with Rosneft, Chernyshova stressed that all the current agreements will remain in force. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia and Norway had good prospects in trade and expressed hope that the results of the joint work achieved in recent years would not be lost. Norway was one of the countries that joined anti-Russia sanctions imposed over Moscow's alleged meddling in the Ukrainian conflict. One of the recent waves of sanctions specifically targeted the country's energy sector, prohibiting the export of goods, services and technologies for deep water, Arctic and shale oil exploration to Russia. In response, Moscow banned the import of certain Norwegian food products, including fish."
"Global Central Banking in 2015, a First Quarter Update for 25 Economies",Norway,"The world's central banks will navigate three defining cross-currents in 2015: A Federal Reserve that has grown more confident about the prospects for the U.S. economy; troubling doubts about growth in the world's other large economies; and an oil price drop that will make it difficult to read which way inflation trends are moving. Janet Yellen's goodbye message to markets at the end of 2014 was that U.S. short-term interest rate increases were coming in 2015. The Fed chairwoman is in no hurry to move. Officials have signaled they expect the first increase by midyear. And when they do move rates up, they'll likely proceed cautiously, given their deep reluctance to do anything that would derail the U.S. expansion. Still, a move of any kind would be historic. U.S. rates have been near zero for 72 straight months. While Ms. Yellen plots her exit, the People's Bank of China , the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank are all exploring new ways to cheapen the cost of credit to stimulate investment and spending in their disappointing economies. In 2014, this was a cocktail for a stronger dollar . A broad index of the U.S. currency's value increased 12.5% last year, a trend that could well continue if central banks behave as expected. A stronger dollar, better growth prospects and higher credit costs could also be a recipe for capital flows into U.S. dollar assets. The Fed has been arguing since the 2008 financial crisis that it would use new regulatory tools--in collaboration with other U.S. regulators--to restrain the next U.S. asset boom. The coming months could be a test of whether U.S. regulators are really prepared to confront such a threat. They could also be a test of the ability of other central banks to manage the tidal shifts in capital flows working toward their shores. Crude oil prices-- down 46% in 2014 --are an additional wild card for central banks to manage. Central bankers often say they look through big swings in food and oil prices, because they are volatile and driven by temporary factors. This was the message the Fed adopted at year-end. However such a large price drop is surely sending a deeper signal about the global economy. The signal could be soft global demand; it could also be an America economy bolstered by an energy supply boom. Central bankers misread it at their peril. What follows is our roundup of how the world's central banks--large and small--are reading these signals as they chart a course for the new year. Click on the central bank names in this chart to see a profile of that institution, or scroll down and read them all. Enjoy! CENTRAL BANKS: AMERICAS By Jon Hilsenrath Cut the world into three slices--Asia, Europe and the Americas--and the monetary outlook for one of these three slices looks much different than it does for the other two. Interest rates are heading up in the Americas but down in the Europe and Asia, thanks in part to the differences in growth prospects. Leading the pack in the Americas is the U.S., where the Federal Reserve is expected to start gradually nudging interest rates higher by midyear, barring an unforeseen shock to growth or a new downdraft in inflation. In Latin America, the Bank of Mexico is expected to follow the Fed's lead. Meantime the Central Bank of Brazil is expected to continue a campaign of interest rate increases that has already taken rates from 7.25% to near 12% since April 2013 in the face of above-target inflation. Canada also faces inflation above the central bank's target. That normally would prompt rate increases, though the Bank of Canada could wait as its economy--a big energy producer--adjusts to the shock of lower oil prices. The Americas isn't exactly catching fire. Commodities producers such as Canada, Mexico and Brazil face real challenges in a world burdened by slow emerging market growth. But with the U.S. in their home court, they might have an advantage. U.S. Federal Reserve By Jon Hilsenrath Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen spent much of 2014 laying the groundwork for what could be an eventful 2015, marked by the first central bank interest rate increases in nearly a decade. With the job market improving and inflation pressures gently building under the economy's surface despite recent oil price declines, ""at some point it will become appropriate to begin reducing policy accommodation, "" Ms. Yellen said at her December press conference. The Fed said in its December policy statement it ""can be patient"" in deciding when to start raising its benchmark short-term rate from near zero, where it has been for six years. Ms. Yellen said this means a rate increase is unlikely in the first three months of the year. One of her top lieutenants, New York Fed President William Dudley , said the most likely time for liftoff is midyear. Fed officials' forecasts suggest short-term rates will go to a little over 1% by the end of the year. What could go wrong? Fed officials don't really know how the financial system will respond to higher U.S. rates. They could trigger market turbulence abroad, as happened in 2013 when it signaled a coming end to the bond purchases. Already, the prospect of Fed rate increases, combined with weak economic growth, has caused the U.S. dollar to strengthen and many other currencies to fall. That makes it harder for people and firms around the world to repay loans made in U.S. dollars. Financial turmoil elsewhere in the world could, in turn, shake U.S. markets and hit the economy in unforeseen ways. ""When I worry about next year, I worry more about the rest of the world and its feedback on the U.S.,"" said Donald Kohn , a member of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee and former vice chairman of the Fed. ""The U.S. isn't immune from a global flight from risky assets."" There also is a risk of financial instability bred at home. The last two U.S. recessions were caused by domestic financial booms and busts. The recent long period of exceptionally low interest rates may be setting the stage for another boom-bust cycle. Fed officials say they are monitoring for financial excesses more systematically than before and don't see dangerous leverage building in the system. Still, some ingredients and signs of an asset boom might be emerging. The S&P; 500 stock index rose 11.4% in 2014. A rising dollar could be signaling global investment flows into the U.S. that push up asset prices to destabilizing high levels. Then there is the risk that Fed officials have once again plotted an exit from easy money that isn't destined to take place. In 12 of the past 14 years the Fed has overestimated how fast the economy would grow in the coming 12 months. Their optimism could be dashed again in 2015 by unforeseeable shocks or structural changes in the U.S. economy that could restrain growth, such as its aging population and diminished productivity growth. Add to that the effects of falling oil prices, which are likely to push down inflation--already running below the Fed's 2% target . Fed officials say they expect inflation to creep higher over time, but it remains unclear whether that will happen. Nagging downward pressure on inflation and continued disappointments on growth could mean the Fed doesn't move rates very far. Central Bank of Brazil By Paulo Trevisani Brazil is going through major shifts in economic policy, but one piece has remained steady: The central bank and its determination to lower inflation. President Dilma Rousseff won re-election in October and a month later announced a new economic team, but kept central bank President Alexandre Tombini in his job. The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate, called the Selic, to 11.75% in December, the latest in a series of increases since April 2013 when the rate was 7.25%. Market participants and economists expect more rate increases in the months ahead, though perhaps smaller or fewer than more hawkish analysts advocate. A weekly survey with 100 economists made by the central bank shows a median forecast of 12.5% for the Selic at the end of 2015. Analysts expect that level to be reached rather sooner than later. The central bank does not expect to hit its inflation target of 4.5% inflation, with a two-percentage-point range of tolerance above or below that level, before late 2016, if all remains as it is, according to the minutes of its December rate-setting meeting. Central bank officials expect economic growth to resume in the second half of 2015, the minutes said. They also think inflation could move even higher than the current 6.6% level in the short term, but will start moving down later in 2015. Mr. Tombini and his team have said their job would be made easier if the government saved more. The government's spending has increased faster than its income in recent years, helping fuel price increases. The new finance minister Joaquim Levy has pledged to increase government saving, which could help cool down inflation, even if at the cost of slower economic growth. However, Brazil is en route to finish 2014 with no government budget surplus, not counting interest payments, and perhaps even a deficit. Bank of Canada By Nirmala Menon Sliding oil prices will be at the forefront for Canada's central bank as it prepares to update economic forecasts in January, and its outlook will be key in determining when interest rates will rise. Some analysts say the plunge in oil prices will force the Bank of Canada to delay raising its benchmark rate from 1% until 2016, well after the U.S. Federal Reserve moves. The bank will issue quarterly forecasts on Jan. 21, together with its first interest rate decision of 2015. Canada is a net exporter of oil, which accounts for roughly one-fifth of its total shipments. Stephen Poloz, governor of the central bank, said in December declining oil prices would shave one-third of a percentage point off economic growth in 2015, deeper than the one-quarter point he had predicted in October, but some analysts suggest he might have underestimated the hit. 5 Jan 2015 06:02 ET Global Central Banking in 2015, a First Quarter -2- Canada has been an outlier on the inflation front among major economies that are seeing an oil-induced decline in consumer prices. Inflation in Canada has been rising, pushing past the central bank's 2% target. The bank says the uptick is transitory and Mr. Poloz said falling oil prices will drive consumer prices down. The central bank has not altered its key policy rate for more than four years, the longest stand-pat period since the 1950s, and this may extend well into a fifth if oil prices don't recover. The Canadian economy grew at a 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter, stronger than the Bank of Canada and markets had forecast. This would ordinarily have moved up the timeline for rate increases ""but now the downdraft from oil is going to be significant enough to push back that timetable,"" says Avery Shenfeld , chief economist of CIBC World Markets . Bank of Mexico By Anthony Harrup The Bank of Mexico is likely to leave interest rates unchanged in the first quarter as long as the U.S. Federal Reserve remains patient and the Mexican peso holds its ground against the dollar. The slump in world oil prices in late 2014, which sent the peso to a near six-year low against greenback, rocked but didn't overturn the view that the Bank of Mexico would keep the overnight lending rate target at its record-low 3% until the Fed starts hiking. The peso slide prompted the Bank of Mexico to auction $200 million on days when the peso is 1.5% weaker from the previous session. Just days before, the central bank warned that a sustained currency depreciation would be an inflation risk, despite the usually low pass-through to consumer prices. The bank expects annual inflation to ease from its current 4.2% to the 3% target by mid-2015. Gov. Agustín Carstens has said Mexico could raise interest rates if necessary in response to further peso depreciation, although the dollar auctions have so far appeared to contain the rout. ""We expect the next rate move to be a hike, likely within a short period of time after the Fed funds liftoff date,"" said Goldman Sachs economists in a recent analysis. However, if the peso were to keep falling and worsen the inflation outlook and inflation expectations, the Mexican central bank could start raising rates before the Fed moves, the economists said. The consensus view in Banamex's most recent survey of banks is that the Bank of Mexico's next rate move will be a quarter-point increase in July. CENTRAL BANKS: ASIA By Jacob M. Schlesinger While the U.S. Federal Reserve's 2015 focus is on when to raise interest rates, central banks across Asia are tilting toward looser monetary policies. The main reasons: an unpredictable slowdown in China, which increasingly dominates the region's economy, as a well as weakness in global commodities markets buffeting major Asian exports. The bias toward more monetary stimulus also reflects mounting fears of disinflation, even deflation, in the fastest-growing corner of the world, a remarkable turn from an era when rapid growth, particularly among developing nations, was usually linked to warnings of inflationary overheating. Indeed, the deflation that has infected Asia's most advanced economy, Japan, is now showing signs of complicating the work of neighboring central banks. The weak yen resulting from the Bank of Japan's aggressive, uphill antideflation battle has undermined South Korean exports, raising expectations the Bank of Korea will cut rates in early 2015. Some Asian central bankers worry easy money may undermine structural reforms underway and fuel financial bubbles. Such concerns appear to be weighing on the People's Bank of China, as officials there face mounting pressure to loosen credit to try and stabilize growth. For Asia's economies in 2015, whether and how the PBOC eases may matter as much as when and how the Fed tightens. People's Bank of China By Lingling Wei China's central bank is coming under greater pressure to loosen credit in the first quarter of 2015 to prop up the world's second-largest economy. Since making its first interest-rate cut in two years in November, the People's Bank of China has been resisting calls from commercial banks to free up more funds to help boost their lending. Instead, it has resorted to piecemeal measures, such as injecting short-term funds into the banks, to spur stronger growth. The PBOC is concerned that loosening its monetary policy too much would enable banks to keep lending to state-owned companies, long their favored clientele, while continuing to ignore the smaller borrowers Beijing sees as vital to building a more balanced economy. Central bank officials also dislike that the interest-rate cut so far has triggered a stock-market rally but done little to lower borrowing costs for Chinese businesses. The need for additional central bank easing is growing. China's leadership has made it clear that stabilizing the economy is a top priority for 2015. That calls for more lending by Chinese banks that so far have been wary of extending credit due to falling deposit levels that have pushed up their funding costs. China economist Haibin Zhu predicts that in the first quarter, the PBOC will lower the share of deposits banks must set aside against financial trouble -- known as the reserve-requirement ratio -- by a half percentage point. Currently, big Chinese banks have to hold an amount equivalent to 20% of deposits at the central bank. Reducing that by half a percentage point would free up funds to lend by about 500 billion yuan, or about $81 billion. Mr. Zhu also expects the PBOC to reduce interest rates again in the first quarter. ""Weak growth and lower inflation sets the stage for further policy easing,"" he says. Bank of Japan By Jacob M. Schlesinger This is a make-or-break year for Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's campaign to end his country's long deflationary era. At his first central bank meeting in April 2013, Mr. Kuroda famously pledged to stop prices from falling, and to create 2% inflation in two years. As the deadline approaches, the most closely watched inflation gauge is slipping further from the target, and most private-sector economists have turned skeptical of success prospects, especially with oil prices plunging. Many forecasters expect Japan's key price index -- which hit a 1.5% annual rate after Mr. Kuroda's first year in office -- to drop to 0.5% by mid-2015. Some say it could even turn negative again. As a result, most BOJ watchers surveyed expect the BOJ to expand yet again its stimulus program in 2015, though there's little consensus on when. Mr. Kuroda remains publicly upbeat, though he and aides have increasingly emphasized what they insist was the always-intended flexibility in the time frame, saying the goal is ""about two years,"" and that their focus is not on calendar year 2015, but fiscal year 2015, which actually ends in March 2016. BOJ officials say they can tolerate an oil-induced inflation drop for some time, and that trend alone would be unlikely to trigger further easing, at least not in the year's first quarter. They expect lower crude costs to give a big boost to the economy, which depends heavily on imported oil, and foster inflationary pressures. Besides, Japan's central bankers are now focused more on spring labor negotiations than any other indicator. Mr. Kuroda sees robust wage growth as the key to fostering a self-sustaining ""virtuous cycle"" of modest inflation. If union contracts settled in March and April show a big jump in base pay, the BOJ seems likely to be satisfied monitoring how that ripples through price-setting over the following months before fretting too much about the current consumer price index. Reserve Bank of Australia By Shani Raja Australia's central bank has strongly hinted interest rates will remain near their current record-low levels well into 2015 given the economy's failure to pick up much speed this year. While warning against excessive gloominess, policy makers are clearly disappointed by a sharp drop this year in prices for Australia's biggest export--iron ore--and by weakness in the economies of major trading partners such as China and Japan. Central bank officials also are concerned by new fiscal austerity measures they fear may choke growth at a time when mining investment is drying up at the tail end of a decade-long resources boom. The conservative government's first budget included tax increases and steep spending cuts aimed at reducing a festering deficit. The government has since scaled back the plan amid a public backlash and stiffening political opposition. The central bank has been lowering interest rates since late 2011 to help fuel growth in parts of the economy outside mining. The benchmark cash rate has been 2.5% for well over a year--so far to little avail. Apart from fueling the housing market, which has heated up to potentially hazardous levels amid a surge in speculative home buying, low rates aren't doing much to boost consumer confidence or spending. Economic growth slowed to a crawl in the third quarter as the commodity-price falls dented export earnings, while 6.2% unemployment is hovering around a 12-year high. The drop in iron ore prices has raised bets that interest rates will move lower in 2015, as the central bank battles to keep the economy out of recession. The reserve bank, which is attempting to ""rebalance"" the economy away from its long dependence on mining, also wants to see the Australian dollar fall further to help make the country's exports and tourism sector more competitive. Reserve Bank of India By Gabriele Parussini The Reserve Bank of India's governor Raghuram Rajan has been warning for months that a storm was brewing in global financial markets. Now, some would say, the rumbling and lightning has started. With oil prices plunging, the dollar crushing other currencies and investors fleeing emerging markets, some are concerned that there could even be a repeat of the earthquake that shook the global financial system in 1998. 5 Jan 2015 06:02 ET Global Central Banking in 2015, a First Quarter -3- Compared with some of his emerging market colleagues though, Mr. Rajan sits in a comfortable position. Having resisted pressures from businesses and politicians to cut interest rates, the RBI is now better prepared to sail through rough seas with conveniently high lending rates, which may prove precious ammunition if the storm gains strength. Its benchmark repo rate is 8%. Mr. Rajan, who has left interest rates untouched for eleven months, suggested late last year that rate cuts are likely in early 2015. It remains to be seen whether market conditions will allow them. He has noted the dangers of flip-flopping, saying that moving cautiously down the rate-cutting path is better than going fast, and having to backtrack later. Still, Mr. Rajan is staring at other dilemmas. The fall in oil prices has helped India contain annual consumer price inflation, which was 4.38% in November. Mr. Rajan has said the prerequisite for a rate cut would be inflation no higher than 8% in January 2015 and on track to be no more than 6% in January 2016. But if oil remains cheap, the purchasing power of oil-producing countries will fall, affecting some of India's largest export markets. Economic growth, which slowed to 5.3% in the three months that ended Sept 30 from a year earlier, needs a boost to provide the new jobs the country's growing population. Bank Indonesia By I Made Sentana Bank Indonesia will likely maintain its current tight monetary stance during the first quarter of 2015 to shield Southeast Asia's largest economy from global uncertainties, though the option of raising interest rates remains on the table. ""Interest rates are one of the monetary tools that the central bank still can use,"" Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Gov. Mirza Adityaswara said on Dec. 17 when asked whether rate increases were no longer an option. The central bank in November raised its benchmark BI rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75% to try to curb inflation after President Joko Widodo raised heavily subsidized domestic fuel prices by 30 percent. That was the first increase since December 2013. Most economists interviewed expect Bank Indonesia to hold rates steady in the first quarter, but some see rate increases as possible. If the U.S. Federal Reserve moves as expected to raise U.S. interest rates, and if that sparks capital outflows from emerging markets, some economists predict Bank Indonesia might first raise the interest rates it pays on commercial banks' time deposits. If this doesn't work, they explained, the central bank would most likely boost the BI rate, which would affect interest rates commercial banks apply on saving accounts, mortgages, and loans. Mr. Adityaswara didn't rule out the option of raising rates on time deposits, adding Indonesia must continue to attract capital because it needs offshore funds to finance business activities and government spending. Bank Indonesia refrained from increasing interest rates in December, even though the rupiah fell to its lowest levels in 16 years against the dollar as many global investors sold assets of emerging markets still considered fragile. The selloff in Indonesia served as a reminder that its assets are still viewed as risky even though the country won plaudits last year for the efforts by the government and central bank to strengthen the economy. Bank of Korea By Kwanwoo Jun In South Korea, many observers expect the central bank to cut its policy rate in the first quarter of 2015 in response to a weakening outlook for growth. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol indicated on Dec. 11 that the central bank would lower its economic growth projection for 2015 in a quarterly outlook due to be issued on Jan. 15. The central bank's most recent forecast was for the South Korean economy to grow 3.9% in 2015. Of 20 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, 12 expect the Bank of Korea to cut its base rate by a quarter percentage point from the current level of 2.0% by the end of March, while the remaining eight forecast the central bank will stand pat in the first three months of 2015. Domestic demand remains weak in South Korea, while the won's rapid gains against the yen following Japan's recent monetary easing may also prompt the Bank of Korea to cut interest rates further. A stronger won relative to the yen hurts South Korean exporters that compete against Japanese companies. However, Korean policy makers are somewhat concerned about keeping borrowing costs too low because of high household debt levels and possible capital flight triggered by the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected rate increases in 2015. The Bank of Korea cut its policy rate twice in 2014. Reserve Bank of New Zealand By Rebecca Howard Tumbling export prices, tepid inflation and the high local currency kept New Zealand's central bank on hold in December but more rate increases are likely in 2015, although later rather than sooner. New Zealand's agriculture-rich economy has been supported in recent years by surging demand from Asia's rising middle classes for its dairy exports, and by a construction boom following a series of devastating earthquakes. The economy outperformed many of its peers and the Kiwi central bank was among the first in the developed world to raise interest rates since the financial crisis, lifting them by one percentage point in 2014 to 3.50%. Global dairy prices, however, are down more 50% from their recent peak in February. That, coupled with inflation that is running at the bottom of the central bank's 1% to 3% target range and the still-high Kiwi dollar--has kept the bank on hold since July. ""Inflation is currently low, but is expected to rise slowly over the medium term, with continued strong demand growth and increasing pressures on capacity. We expect a gradual increase in interest rates,"" Reserve Bank Gov. Graeme Wheeler said on Dec. 11. The central's forecasts show that any rate increases are likely to come later in 2015 rather than earlier. Economists are now expecting it to begin lifting rates mid-year at the earliest. Gov. Wheeler said future rate increases will depend on strong net immigration, with record numbers of migrants buying homes and boosting spending in the economy, how house price inflation develops in the face of still-low interest rates and how reduced dairy farm incomes affect spending. Bank of Thailand By Nopparat Chaichalearmmongkol The Bank of Thailand is expected to maintain its 2% interest rate through at least the first quarter of the new year, in the midst of data showing the country's economic recovery has been slower than earlier estimated. The last time the central bank moved its benchmark rate was last March, when it announced a quarter-percentage-point cut. It has held steady since then amid challenges at home and abroad, including a domestic military coup and an economic slump and uncertainty about the global economy. In a statement after its Monetary Policy Committee met on Dec. 17, the central bank said it will keep an accommodative policy to ""reinforce the momentum of economic recovery."" Recent economic data signal some progress: The Thai economy grew 0.6% in the third quarter of 2014 compared with the same period the year before, and 1.1% from the preceding quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That is a slight improvement compared with the second quarter. Looking ahead, the Bank of Thailand noted in early December the country will be affected in 2015 by the health of the global economy and the policy decisions of central banks in advanced economies, which could boost volatility in capital flows. Barnabas Gan, an economist at OCBC Bank, said the anticipated interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2015 could prompt the Bank of Thailand to slightly boost its benchmark rate in the second half of 2015. CENTRAL BANKS: EUROPE/MIDDLE EAST/AFRICA By Brian Blackstone For Europe's central banks, the New Year begins in earnest on Jan. 22, when the European Central Bank will decide whether to ramp up its stimulus efforts by purchasing large swaths of government bonds of eurozone countries. ECB officials have hinted strongly they're ready to take this step, known as quantitative easing, in the first quarter. The question for the rest of the region, from Sweden to Poland to Switzerland, is whether more aggressive ECB policies will stir a bearable ripple or a destabilizing tidal wave across Europe. If ECB stimulus, backed by other economic policies, were to restore vitality to the bloc's beleaguered economy, it would be a boon to the 10 or so European countries outside the currency zone that depend on it as their biggest export market. But if the eurozone remains in the doldrums and all the ECB achieves is a weaker euro, it may ignite a race to the bottom with central banks competing with easy-money policies to protect their currencies and economies. Central banks in Switzerland and Denmark have already cut their deposit rates into negative territory and Sweden may follow suit with negative rates. Others are watching closely. If the ECB doesn't manage its policies right, it could turn into a tough year for Europe's central bankers. European Central Bank By Brian Blackstone The main question for the European Central Bank in early 2015 isn't whether it will widen its economic stimulus efforts, but rather how to do so. The ECB is widely expected to launch a broad based asset-purchase program that includes government bonds as soon as its first policy meeting of the year on Jan. 22, or by March at the latest. The central bank's easing measures since September included record-low interest rates, four-year loans to banks, and purchases of covered bonds and asset-backed securities. The aim was to raise the ECB's balance sheet--the value of assets it holds--by around EUR1 trillion over the next couple of years. 5 Jan 2015 06:02 ET Global Central Banking in 2015, a First Quarter -4- But current measures are unlikely to achieve this, and officials dropped heavy hints in late 2014 that they will broaden asset purchases to include government bonds of eurozone countries, with perhaps some corporate bonds thrown in for good measure. The aim of the policy, known as quantitative easing or QE, would be to stimulate stronger growth and higher inflation by flooding the bloc's $13.2 trillion economy with freshly-created money, reducing borrowing costs for the public and private sectors and weakening the euro's exchange rate. December inflation figures, due Jan. 7, should help cement the case for QE by showing consumer prices flat or even slightly negative on an annual basis, far below the ECB's 2% target. Yet ECB President Mario Draghi faces a tough choice: unveil a massive, unconditional QE program that impresses markets but risks stoking the fury of German ECB officials and their conservative allies; or go with a more limited program that shields the bank's balance sheet from credit risk. Unlike central banks in the U.S., U.K. and Japan that have launched QE in recent years, the ECB doesn't operate through a single bond channel. Rather, there are 19 different government bond markets in the eurozone, with varying degrees of riskiness. And Greek elections slated for late January may embolden QE skeptics. ""The risk is high that the ECB may only implement a compromise QE solution - a half-baked plan where Mario Draghi will gather consensus among parties by making concessions, but where the central bank may end up doing too little, too late,"" said analysts at RBS, in a research note. Even if the ECB goes big, doubts persist as to whether it would do much to spur growth, particularly in countries such as France and Italy that are struggling with moribund economies and a lack of confidence over the effectiveness of government economic policies. Still, such concerns are unlikely to derail QE given the crippling effects that doing nothing would have on financial markets and the ECB officials' own credibility. They've come too far to turn back now. Bank of England By Jason Douglas What a difference a quarter makes. Three months ago, the Bank of England appeared on course to become the first of the world's major central banks to finally call time on years of crisis-era policies by starting to raise interest rates in early 2015. The U.K. economy was humming along nicely and unemployment was tumbling fast, eating up the slack that usually keeps inflation at bay. Now investors doubt the BOE will raise its benchmark interest rate this year at all. Interest-rate swaps, instruments that allow investors to hedge against or speculate on future changes in short-term rates, currently imply the U.K. central bank won't lift its benchmark rate from a low of 0.5% until sometime in the first quarter of 2016 and that it won't be much higher than 1% by the end of 2017. So what's changed? The economy is slowing a little but the central bank expects it to keep expanding at close to its long-run trend rate of growth of around 2.5% for the next couple of years. Unemployment is predicted to fall further. The big difference is the outlook for inflation. Plunging prices for oil and other imports--especially from the neighboring eurozone--are bearing down on consumer-price gains, exacerbated by a relatively strong pound. And while wage growth is beginning to accelerate after years of stagnation, it remains feeble. That mix of factors pulled the annual rate of inflation down to just 1% in November. BOE policy makers expect inflation to cool further in coming months, a development that would require Gov. Mark Carney to write a letter to the government explaining why the Monetary Policy Committee had failed to meet its target. Some economists think the annual rate could briefly touch zero. Investors have concluded that with inflation subdued, BOE officials will move slowly and cautiously when they do eventually raise rates. Officials have stressed they are conscious the U.K.'s progress could easily be thrown off course by upsets elsewhere in the global economy. A rate rise in late 2015 is still possible, but for many, 2016 looks the better bet. The BOE has also announced plans to tweak its communications regime to make its decision-making process easier to follow. It plans to start publishing in late 2015 minutes of its policy meetings on the same day the policy decisions are announced. In 2016, it plans to move to eight meetings a year instead of its current 12. Czech National Bank By Leos Rousek With a strong recovery of the eurozone economy still a distant prospect, the Czech National Bank is expected to continue its policy of preventing its currency, the koruna, from appreciating too much against the euro. The Czech central bank has been battling to avoid a slide into deflation, a decline in the overall price level. With its benchmark interest rate close to zero, it has since late 2013 prevented the koruna from strengthening above 27.00 to the euro. A stronger currency would push down the prices of Czech imports from the eurozone, and also make its exports to its main trading partner more expensive. Both developments could further weaken already low inflation, which was just 0.6% in Nov. 2014 ""Eurozone economic problems remain a worry,"" CNB Governor Miroslav Singer said after at the bank's December policy meeting, when he also hinted it might adjust its currency pledge to reflect fresh data on domestic wages due in early 2015. Mr. Singer said a delay on an exit from the exchange rate commitment is more likely than an early halt of the policy. ""We expect the central bank to maintain its current monetary policy setting not only until 2016 but at least until 2017,"" said Petr Sklenar, an economist at the Prague-based J&T; Bank. Other analysts expect the bank to delay its exit from weak-currency regime until the second half of 2016. In November 2013 amid fears of deflation, the CNB intervened in foreign exchange markets and weakened the koruna by more than 5% to the euro. The bank said it would continue to prevent the koruna from appreciating beyond 27.00 and that it would it allow the currency to trade freely at weaker levels. Its verbal intervention commitment has proved enough to limit the koruna moves between 27.20 and 27.90 to the euro. Denmark's Nationalbanken By Charles Duxbury Monetary policy makers in Denmark will be watching the European Central Bank closely over the months ahead as they seek to keep the Danish currency stable against the euro -- the cornerstone of policy at Nationalbanken. Recent signals from the ECB that it may launch large-scale asset purchases in the first quarter have pushed the euro lower against the Danish krone and the Nationalbanken has responded by intervening in currency markets. Analysts think the Nationalbanken may need to cut interest rates soon to ensure the krone stays within the band the central bank has set for its desired krone-euro exchange rate. Analysts at Nordea bank have forecast the Danish central bank will cut both the lending rate and the deposit rate by a tenth of a percentage point--from 0.2% and negative 0.05%, respectively--within three months. National Bank of Hungary By Margit Feher Hungary's central bank is committed to keeping its main interest rate unchanged at the current 2.1% record low until the end of 2015, but plunging oil prices may lead to more consumer-price declines and thus a need to resume rate cuts. The central bank projects that inflation will accelerate to 2.9% in 2016, nearing its 3% target, but prices fell for most of 2014 on government-mandated utility price cuts, and are expected to continue to do so, now on the oil price plunge. Some economists see the bank cutting its main rate to 1.7% in the first quarter of 2015 to propel price increases and protect a weakening economic recovery. Hungary's exposure to swings in investor sentiment should lessen after banks--as forced by the government--convert households' foreign-currency mortgages into the local currency. The country's current account will likely continue to generate a robust surplus, serving as another shield against adverse market developments. Still Hungary will remain vulnerable due to its persistently high public debt of somewhat less than 80% of GDP. The Hungarian forint weakened last year to a three-year low against the euro and a 12-year low against the U.S. dollar. Should the Hungarian forint remain weak for an extended period, or if investors withdraw from emerging markets when the U.S. Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates in 2015, the National Bank of Hungary may need to raise interest rates later in 2015. Bank of Israel By Joshua Mitnick With sluggish economic growth and inflation more or less flat, the Bank of Israel kept interest rates steady at an all-time low of 0.25% during the last quarter of 2014 and for January as well. The central bank is expected to stay the course for the first half of 2015, according to some Israeli economists. Bank of Israel Gov. Karnit Flug and the central bank's monetary policy committee is focused on ensuring the annual pace of inflation returns to the government's target range of 1% to 3%. ""I don't see a rate hike in the next quarter... What is needed is substantial and lasting improvement in pace of GDP,"" said Gil Bufman, the chief economist at Bank Leumi, who added that only ""around May will we have enough data on whether the economy has turned the corner."" Inflation might get a boost from a resurgent dollar, which gained as much as 15 percent against the shekel since the beginning of 2014 and could prompt rising consumer prices if the U.S. currency continues to advance. There's less consensus about the second half of 2015. The central bank's research department said at the end of December that it doesn't expect a rate increase until 2016, but the consensus among private forecasters is for modest increase before the end of 2015. 5 Jan 2015 06:02 ET Global Central Banking in 2015, a First Quarter -5- The bank will be monitoring Israel's economic activity for signs of more robust growth, a development which analysts believe would make a rate increase a possibility. The central bank expects growth to accelerate slightly from 2.5% in 2014 to 3.2% in 2015. A decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the U.S. could also prompt an Israeli increase. But for the time being, economic forecasters say they don't see any of the factors that would call for a boost in lending rates. Norway's Central Bank By Charles Duxbury Norway's central bank has made clear that concerns about weak economic growth are at the top of its watch list in 2015. After a long period of inactivity, the bank cut its main rate in December to 1.25%, citing the effects on the wider Norwegian economy of a falling oil price. It has also flagged that it will lower interest rates again if the resource-dependent economy looks like it is losing further momentum. However, if a recent weakening of the Norwegian krone persists, that could lift imported inflation and sap the central bank's appetite to cut rates. Inflation in Norway is already close to the 2.5% target, unlike many other economies in Europe that are struggling with inflation rates near zero. Central Bank of Poland By Patryk Wasilewski Divisions among Polish rate setters make the outlook for central bank policy highly uncertain over coming months. The central bank's 10-member Monetary Policy Council has to balance a gradual economic recovery against a period of deflation that has mainly been caused by external factors, such as falling global oil prices. Analysts are split over whether the central bank will leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% this year or lower it in the first quarter. Proponents of holding steady stress the economy's resilience in the face of stagnation in the neighboring eurozone, and expect recovery to eventually bring inflation closer to target. Right now, they have the upper hand. However, voting records and rate setters' comments suggest they have an advantage of just one vote more than the proponents of further easing, with analysts pointing to Elzbieta Chojna-Duch as the key policy maker. The views of rate setters are at their most divergent since the MPC was established in 1998. In November, three rate cut motions were filed, and all failed. Last month, one of the council members suggested the benchmark interest rate should be raised to somewhere between 2.5% and 3%. Another member the same day said rates could be cut by another percentage point without any risk to the economy. The central bank's latest forecasts put the annual inflation rate in 2015 at 1.1%, with economic growth at 3.0%. Bank of Russia By Andrey Ostroukh The Bank of Russia faces a tricky combination of high inflation and economic contraction in the first half of 2015, and may resort to new, unconventional policy measures to steady financial conditions. While poor economic prospects speak for a rate cut, double-digit inflation points toward a need for tight monetary policy. The central bank had expected to keep the annual rate of inflation below 6.5% in 2014. But the consumer price index rose by more than 10% as the ruble lost more than 40% of its value against the U.S. dollar, pushed lower by falling oil prices and Western sanctions in response to Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Inflation is expected to spike to 15% in the first half of this year, far above the central bank's target of 4.5%, the level it hopes to reach in 2017. The Bank of Russia raised its key rate six times in 2014, to 17% by year end from 6.5% at the start. The rapid rise was intended to rein in inflation, but is crimping the banking sector and broader economy. In 2015, when Russia's economy is seen shrinking by some 4% if oil prices average $60 per barrel, the central bank will have to support the banking sector with liquidity injections. It already provides funds while accepting non-marketable assets as collateral, and may have to relaunch non-collateral auctions in order to feed the financial system with rubles. But after Western sanctions cut off Russia from global capital markets, the central bank will have to make sure that the rubles it provides without any collateral won't be immediately used to buy dollars or euros. In 2015, Russian banks and companies will need around $101.6 billion to pay back their foreign debt. To ease pressure on the ruble and meet demand for hard currencies, the central bank has started providing dollars and euros to the market through currency swaps and repurchase agreement auctions. The central bank's latest provision of foreign currencies, however, has taken Russia's gold and foreign exchange reserves below $400 billion for the first time since 2009. The central bank has said it won't burn its reserves, hinting that it may tolerate a weaker ruble. In December, the central bank promised to consider cutting its benchmark rate, but said that it needs to be sure that inflationary risks are contained. South African Reserve Bank By Patrick McGroarty South Africa's years-long struggle with slow growth and high inflation shows no sign of abating in 2015. South African Reserve Bank Gov. Lesetja Kganyago, who took over from Gill Marcus in November, has said he will adopt his predecessor's resolve to raise rates off four-decade lows. The bank last raised its key rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.75% in July. Further rate increases have been forestalled by South Africa's tepid economy. Strikes and power outages limited economic growth to an estimated 1.4% in 2014. Economists see little signs of recovery this year. That means that even as the currency, the rand, plummets past six-year lows compared with the U.S. dollar, the bank might wait a while longer before its next rate increase. ""We think the South African Reserve Bank has room to stay accommodative for longer,"" says Laura Papi, the International Monetary Fund's mission chief for South Africa. She added, though, that the central bank can't be counted on to pull South Africa out of its low-growth trap. ""There is not much at this point that fiscal and monetary policy can do to increase growth in a sustainable way,"" she said. Sweden's Riksbank By Charles Duxbury Sweden's central bank heads into 2015 with its focus firmly on the country's very low level of inflation and has stated a willingness to use unconventional monetary policy to raise inflation if necessary. Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said Dec. 16 he thinks a promise to keep the benchmark interest rate at zero until the second half of 2016 will be enough to lift inflation towards a 2% target. If not, he says he has four main tools in his toolbox ready to use: asset purchases; lending to banks; negative interest rates; and currency intervention. The last of these options is his least favored, he said. Analysts at HSBC said they judge a negative interest rate as the most likely of the other three options if the Riksbank decides to go beyond just postponing rate increases. Swiss National Bank By Neil MacLucas The Swiss National Bank opted in December for negative rates to curb demand for its currency and may need to push them even lower unless the European Central Bank can engineer a more convincing recovery in the eurozone, the key market for Swiss goods. The timing of the SNB's decision to charge banks for depositing overnight funds took some analysts by surprise, and helped push the franc off the cap of 1.20 per euro it had been hugging, but the upward pressure on the franc is likely to persist. The franc is traditionally perceived as a safe haven in times of political and economic uncertainty due to the stability of the country's economy and government. The SNB insists the cap of CHF1.20 remains its main policy instrument, and has said it is ready to enforce it ""with the utmost determination."" Analysts, though, are skeptical the negative rates will weaken the franc, and say renewed currency market interventions may be needed. ""Historical precedent suggests negative rates aren't very effective in moving the exchange rate,"" the head of Credit Suisse's economic research team Oliver Adler said. With the ECB meeting on Jan. 22, the day the SNB's negative rates take effect, ""credible actions"" by the ECB to address the deflationary risks in the eurozone could ease the pressure on the franc, and thus the SNB, according to Mr. Adler. Another issue vexing the SNB is the Swiss property market boom, partly fueled by ultra-low mortgage rates, although there are signs of a slowdown in house price gains and in mortgage lending. Since the central bank dares not raise rates for fear of boosting the franc, it has attempted to cool the housing market by stepping in twice to force banks to raise the amount of capital they must set aside against the mortgages they extend. SNB Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine said in December it is ""still too early for an all-clear"" on the real estate market and that imbalances in the market ""remain at a high level."" Central Bank of Turkey By Emre Peker Turkey's central bank enters 2015 bolstered by a sharp drop in oil prices that's slowing high inflation and strengthening Gov. Erdem Basci's hand to cut interest rates to stoke economic growth. The new year also poses fresh challenges to Turkey's $820 billion economy: Russia's darkening economic outlook is fanning risks of spreading turmoil across emerging markets, and the U.S. Federal Reserve's anticipated end to its easy money policies threatens to reverse six years of cheap financing. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pressured the Turkish central bankers to reduce borrowing costs to boost growth. The government missed its economic-expansion goals in recent years, and in October cut its 2015 growth target to 4% from 5%. The market forecast is 3.5%. 5 Jan 2015 06:02 ET Global Central Banking in 2015, a First Quarter -6- The government's call for interest-rate cuts is poised to get louder as Turkey approaches June parliamentary elections, and as slumping oil prices drive inflation toward the 5% target, from about 9% in 2014. ""We will not instantly loosen monetary policy just because of that,"" Mr. Basci said in mid-December, forecasting a quick decline in inflation from January through April. The central bank has held its benchmark interest rate at 8.25% since September. Still, economists said low energy costs and an improving inflation outlook, coupled with the European Central Bank's anticipated government-bond purchases to stimulate the eurozone economy, might encourage Turkish policy-makers to cut rates. ""The exact magnitude of the cuts would depend on the global financial markets and especially on the magnitude of the worries over the start of Fed [rate increases],"" said Yarkin Cebeci, an Istanbul-based economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., forecasting a round of reductions to borrowing costs in the first quarter.

Unlocking secrets of the polar night,Norway,"Winter is the dark season and colder than cold in the Arctic north. But climate warming is giving scientists the chance to find out what goes on in the Arctic ocean during the Polar night. Chunks of glacier ice float past the side of the Helmer Hanssen. The research vessel has stopped in the Kongsfjorden off north-western Svalbard. On the laboratory deck, a hatch opens up. Two young men wrapped up against the cold are unraveling a long net attached to a circular hoop. They clip it to the end of a long cable. ""Ready to go"", says Sören Häfke. The German scientist from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven is hoping for a very particular catch as a crewman helps lower the net into the dark water and down to the ocean floor. He and his colleague Lukas are interested in calanus finmarchius, a small crustacean that plays an important role in the food web. They are trying to find out what makes the tiny creature tick – almost literally. They will be examining the genes of these ocean inhabitants to find out how their biological clock works in the dark, Arctic winter. In summer, it is assumed light tells them when to come to the surface to feed and when to go down deeper to avoid predators. But what happens in winter, when it is dark all day long? ""Life doesn’t stop when the light goes out"" As Stig Falk-Petersen, Professor at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromso and expedition leader explains, until fairly recently the absence of light was thought to render biological marine life in the Arctic winter virtually dormant. With the ice cover making it difficult to access data, little was known about what goes on in the freezing waters and on the seabed below at this time of year. But thanks to research over the past decade – not least to this Polar Night project, which started in 2012 – that has now changed. There are 18 scientists and postgraduate students on board the Helmer Hanssen, and a crew of 12 under Captain Jon Almestad. Built as an ice-going fishing vessel, the boat, which now belongs to Tromso University, is equipped with the technology needed to collect samples of plankton, crustaceans and fish, examine them in the lab, and store samples to be analyzed after the return to port. Paul Renaud is Professor at the University Centre in Svalbard. He is coordinating the logistics of the expedition on board as well as conducting his own biological research. He says the few studies done in the last ten years indicate greater activity in the Arctic Ocean in winter than previously thought. He believes processes other than light act as triggers for that activity. Although critical for the functioning of the ecosystem, ""it’s not that when the light goes out, everything stops functioning,"" Renaud told DW. Climate paradox: easier access – shifting parameters There are two main factors driving the increased research into the Arctic winter. Firstly, new technology makes it possible to take measurements under the ice all year round. One method is to use buoys tethered to the ice, but there are also now a number of permanent observatories which have been set up in the fjords to measure temperature, salinity, oxygen, light, chlorophyll and the movement of plankton. The number of research stations in the region has also increased. The other major factor is climate change. At this time of year two decades ago, this fjord would have been completely covered with ice, whereas the sea ice can now only be found in its far reaches. Renaud says that while the absence of ice makes it much easier to sail up here, it is also changing the parameters scientists want to measure. ""We are addressing a moving target,"" he said. From whalers’ tales to hi-tech Falk-Petersen is keen to stress that this is not the first time in history the area has been ice-free. He says that while satellite observations only began around 1975, climate records in the form of accounts by Dutch whalers and later British expeditions date back to 1550. Around 1680, the whole of Spitsbergen was actually ice free, Falk-Petersen told DW. That lasted until 1800, when the ice expanded from 82 degrees north to 76 degrees north – ""a huge and fast expansion of the ice cap."" The area then remained cold until approximately 1939. The region where we are now has been open again since the year 2000. ""So you have this large variation of ice cover, driven by various climate factors, - temperature, pressure system, and that means a dramatic change for animals living in this area,"" Falk-Petersen said. So far, he feels they have adapted well. Ice, less ice, no ice? When it comes to forecasting how the Arctic Ocean and its ecosystem will react to climate change in the long term, the scientists here say we desperately need more data. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) gives around ten scenarios for how climate in the Arctic could develop, Renaud explains. ""Clearly, if we can rely on predictions that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer from the middle of the century at the latest, that will have certain effects on ecosystems."" Renaud says some organisms are highly flexible and can go without breeding for ten years without dying out. But short-lived organisms that rely on a certain timing of ice, or that live in the sea ice may well be more seriously affected. In order to tell how they will fare in the long term, more information is crucial. Along with climate change, increased development is bringing more changes to this once inaccessible region. Renaud is involved in developing monitoring practices and stresses the need to study the effects of oil exploration, fisheries, tourism and shipping on sensitive components of the Arctic ecosystems. But can research keep pace with the speed of development? The Svalbard expert says there will still be sea ice in the Arctic in winter for the next 100-150 years, which ""buys us a little more time”. But the race is on to identify and monitor the impacts of rapidly growing activities like tourism and shipping. Mud, glorious mud That is why, up on deck of the Helmer Hanssen, Sergei Korsun and PhD student Olga Knayazeva from St. Petersburg are up to their wrists in mud. A large box-shaped container has just been winched up from the ocean floor. Their chosen species lives in the sediment. The tiny forams, single-cell marine organisms, which are present in huge numbers in all marine ecosystems, normally feed on light-dependent phytoplankton. So how do they survive in the harsh northern winter? Winter, says Olga, is a long part of the year. ""We can’t fully understand our tiny friends if we don’t know what happens then."" As the northern lights start to spread their eerie brightness over the black Arctic night, Sergei and Olga take their samples to the lab and the next team comes on deck to set a trawl net for fish and crustacean samples. It’s not just the sea creatures that are active throughout the polar night. And for the scientists on board the Helmer Hanssen, there is still plenty of work to be done."
Traveling to these countries hasn’t been this cheap in years; A strong dollar has made trips abroad increasingly cheap for U.S. travelers,Norway,"A strong dollar has made trips abroad increasingly cheap for U.S. travelers A strong dollar has made trips abroad increasingly cheap for U.S. travelers Have you been holding off on a vacation abroad because it was just too expensive? Well, grab your passport, because there hasn’t been a better time in years to travel internationally. The dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly every currency in the world in 2014. In fact, the dollar gained about 12.5% compared with a basket of currencies (DXY, US) last year, and has already added about 2% in 2015. One big benefit: lower costs for American tourists traveling abroad. This includes the currencies of countries that are notoriously expensive to travel to, such as the Norwegian krone. .

But some other countries are more surprising. Why so cheap? Weakness across the commodities market — primarily in crude oil — has triggered a precipitous decline in many emerging-market currencies. Many of these economies depend on commodity exports for a significant chunk of their gross domestic product, observed Win Thin, global head of emerging-market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. The collapse in crude-oil prices has been the biggest driver, Thin said. Crude-oil futures traded on Nymex have fallen from $110 a barrel in July to under $47 this week. Other commodities, like copper and iron ore, have also seen significant price declines in the past year. “These are all really commodities stories,” Thin said about the emerging-market currencies. In addition to oil, falling iron-ore and copper prices have significantly impacted emerging-market currencies, Thin said. The Russian ruble, the Ukrainian hryvnia and the Norwegian krone have all been dragged lower by falling oil prices, as has the Kazakh tenge. The weakness in commodity prices has been driven, in large part, by slowing economic growth in China. China’s stagnation has weighed on the price of commodities — because slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy inevitably translates to lower growth in demand for oil and iron ore. This, in turn, has weighed on the currencies of economies that rely on these goods for much of their GDP. Some of these currencies, like the Hungarian forint and the Polish zloty, trade mostly against the euro, the currency of their closest trading partners— so their declines against the dollar in the past year are a reflection of the euro’s losses, said Thin. The euro has been falling as economic growth has faltered throughout the eurozone — and, indeed, throughout much of the world. But Poland and Hungary reported strong economic growth in 2014, according to Trading Economics, which tracks global economic data. So what can today’s dollar buy you abroad? Norway The popularity of the Disney animated film “Frozen” has led to a surge in U.S. tourism to Norway, said Steve Loucks, chief communications officer at Travel Leaders Group, a New York–based travel agency. And that popularity couldn’t have come at a better time for U.S. tourists, because the cost of living in Norway is notoriously expensive. Before the krone started weakening, “a dinner for two at McDonald’s would cost you $30,” Loucks said. But the krone was the worst-performing currency of any G-10 country in 2014. In Norway, whose citizens are said to be born with skis on their feet, winter sports are a major tourist attraction. The price of a winter weekend ski pass at Norway’s largest ski resort[http://www.skistar.com/en/Trysil/SkiPass-Skiing/Skipass-Prices/], Trysil, costs 1045 krone per adult — and the value of that in U.S. dollars has fallen by about $40 in the past year. Ski-pass cost comparison: Value in U.S. dollars as of Dec. 31, 2013: $172 Value in U.S. dollars as of Jan. 6, 2015: $135 Argentina Because the dollar’s exchange rate with the Argentinian peso fluctuates so frequently, Argentines relish the opportunity to get their hands on U.S. dollars, said Kim Reicherter, an agent with Tzell Travel. “I have found that, in Argentina, presenting U.S. dollars is your best negotiating tool, and results in the best deals,” Reicherter said. Tourists should be wary of paying for goods with credit cards. Because the exchange rate changes so often, merchants will occasionally use the fluid exchange rate as a smoke screen to quote tourists one price and then charge a larger sum to their card. Buenos Aires, Argentina’s capital and largest city, has plenty for tourists to enjoy.  iLatina is one of Buenos Aires’[http://www.ilatinabuenosaires.com/] finest restaurants, offering diners a seven-course meal. The restaurant’s Latin American cuisine includes caramelized prawns with spicy pineapple and fennel,a Peruvian seafood casserole with grilled octopus, and avocado and aguardiente ice cream. The seven-course meal with wine pairings is listed online as 1,180 pesos per person. If that peso price held constant: Value in U.S. dollars as of Dec. 31, 2013: $181 Value in U.S. dollars as of Jan. 6, 2015: $138 Russia If you can ignore the sociopolitical hang-ups, now is great time to visit Moscow, Loucks said. The Russian capital has historically been one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. But now, Loucks said, “It is a real bargain.” Moscow is known for its vibrant night life and restaurants, as well as the Kremlin and adjacent Saint Basil’s Cathedral. In Saint Petersburg, the Hermitage is one of the world’s great art museums. While you’re there, catch an art-house or festival movie at the 35mm theater[http://www.kino35mm.ru/en], which frequently shows foreign and independent films. Tickets to a film at 35mm will cost about 385 rubles. Dollar cost of that 385-ruble ticket: Value in U.S. dollars as of Dec. 31, 2013: $11.70 Value in U.S. dollars as of Jan. 6, 2015: $6.09 Hungary The cost of a luxury hotel in Budapest is significantly lower than the price of hotels in such cities as London and Paris, which makes Hungary a great destination for tourists looking to take advantage of the strong dollar, said Nathalie Nagy, an agent at Protravel International. For sightseers, Nagy suggested a river cruise along the Danube. The Hungarian State Opera House in Budapest is one of the city’s architectural masterpieces and is also considered one of the world’s finest opera houses. Front-row tickets for a weekend performance in May of “Swan Lake”[http://www.opera.hu/musor/megtekint/a-hattyuk-tava/] will cost 12,000 forints per person. The declining dollar cost of that 12,000-forint ‘Swan Lake’ ticket: Value in U.S. dollars as of Dec. 31, 2013: $55 Value in U.S. dollars as of Jan. 6, 2015: $44 Does the strong dollar make you more inclined to travel internationally this year?"
Workers in Europe's oil hub hope for the best,Norway,"On the docks in Aberdeen, oil workers put a brave face on hundreds of job cuts linked to sinking crude prices while union leaders warn that the worst is yet to come. ""It has happened before and it will happen again. There will probably be job losses but that's the way the industry works,"" said Tony Maguire, a rig worker. But for Jake Molloy, a regional organiser for the RMT union in Aberdeen, Europe's oil capital in northeast Scotland, workers who lose their jobs face ""a lifetime crisis"". Molloy was one of 20,000 people who lost jobs in a downturn in 1986 and said the decline is more dangerous now because North Sea offshore fields are depleting. ""I hope this is just a blip... but I am more concerned now than I was (then),"" he told AFP in an interview in the city, which has been built on oil revenues. Oil prices are currently hovering at around $50 per barrel for Brent crude, the European benchmark, representing a decrease of 60 percent since June when prices were at $115 a barrel. Oil majors have been quick to react: BP, Shell, Conoco Phillips all announced cuts in the last six months. More than half of all jobs in Aberdeen are linked to oil, yet at a time when the industry might be facing the biggest crisis in its history, the atmosphere in the Scottish hub has remained strangely calm. In the port of Aberdeen, where dockers are busy loading equipment for a rig onto massive vessels, workers were trying to stay optimistic. Robert, who has worked on the dock for 29 years and whose son is doing an apprenticeship in the sector, dismissed the latest fall in prices as ""a few blips"". Residents still complain about traffic jams -- seen as a positive sign reflecting the city's commercial buzz and the failure of road infrastructure to keep up. ""If things were really bad the big building outside the airport would stop progressing,"" said Dave, a taxi driver, referring to a luxurious office complex being prepared for Norwegian oil services firm Aker Solutions. Job cuts and their potential consequences on the city have not really sunk in but the warning signs are there. ""Aberdeen could be a ghost town in 10 years' time,"" said Colin Welsh, chief executive of Simmons & Company, a US-based bank specialising in the oil industry. Aberdeen South's member of parliament, Anne Begg, said job cut announcements have not resulted in actual layoffs yet. ""There will be a time delay, and there always is, so we could be looking at another six months to a year before it really starts to impact the economy,"" Begg said. The oil and gas industry has made Aberdeen prosperous -- salaries in the industry are two and a half times the national average -- and the Scottish National Party based its failed drive for independence on a prediction of future bountiful revenues from the North Sea. Local residents, a majority of whom voted against independence, now point out that the SNP had based its budget calculations on a $110 barrel. ""The oil prices have fallen, I did not predict that but nobody else did,"" said Fergus Ewing, the SNP's regional minister for commerce, energy and tourism. ""In politics you play the cards as they fall, we respond to the challenges, the challenges are very serious,"" he said. cv/dt/boc/as/psr"
Magnetic north,Norway,"Features | THE BIG READ Never mind Scandi-noir, the zeitgeist is creeping upwards - to the Arctic Circle. GERARD GILBERT considers the pull the pole has always exerted on us, from Greek myth to the new TV thriller 'Fortitude' When writer Simon Donald was a teenager in early 1980s Scotland, he used tell people that when he grew up he hoped to join the British Antarctic Survey team. He wasn't sure where this ambition came from but, he says: ""Here was something about the extremes, the purity and the starkness. Everything is crystal, clear and defined… unlike adolescence"". The poles answer many calls, it seems, including the confused yelps of pre-adulthood. It was ever thus. The ""Frozen North"", the Arctic, was once a pristine adventure playground for the curious and the greedy and - as a Norwegian ship's captain in Michelle Paver's polar ghost story Dark Matter puts it - ""where you can breathe with both lungs"". But it's also a metaphor, a state of mind, an otherness and a damned good setting for a story. The last great wilderness, you might call it if you didn't fear sounding like a clichéd script for a nature documentary. And in our increasingly over-heated planet it seems that we are increasingly attracted to the cold. Certainly television drama has been steadily heading in that direction. Like 16th-century explorers mapping out the terra incognita to the north of Newfoundland, Norway and Greenland, where their charts blurred and the cartographer's imagination took over (""here be dragons""), so television drama is giving us an ever fuller picture of the frigid climes. From its base camp in Copenhagen, home of The Killing and Borgen, it crossed the Oresund strait to the Malmo of The Bridge before striking out for Norway, setting for the political thriller Mammon and the comedy Lilyhammer, with an idiosyncratic detour to Iceland - where The Night Shift brought the more adventurous BBC4 viewer a workplace sitcom whose ""sit"" was a service station outside Reykjavik. Now, with Simon Donald's 12-part Sky Atlantic thriller Fortitude, the new box-set age of prestige television drama has at last unambiguously breached the Arctic Circle. Despite actually being filmed in Iceland, which is sub-Arctic, Fortitude is set further north, in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, or Spitsbergen as it was first named by its Dutch discoverer, William Barents, whose name lingers in the Barents Sea. Donald tells me that he first settled on an Arctic setting because what his story needed was permafrost. Fair enough - and it beats, say, the freezer storage unit in an abattoir. When Sky Atlantic came into the picture, he also required a mainly British cast, and so Michael Gambon, Jessica Raine and Christopher Eccleston - as well as the American Stanley Tucci and the Danish Sofie Grabol - are to be found in his fictional Svalbard town. This is a land where polar bears roam, but no Eskimos - at least in the first two episodes of Fortitude. Maybe they don't exist in Svalbard. According to the writer A. A. Gill, ""Svalbard was too hardcore even for Eskimos"". It does mean ""cold coast"" in Norwegian. There are several etymological theories about the term Eskimo, some claiming it derives from the Inuit word for ""eaters of raw meat"" - hence one reason why it's now frowned upon. The Inuit word for Europeans is ""kabloona"", which is supposed to refer to our bushy eyebrows - well-groomed Europeans presumably being rare in those parts. Kabloona is also the title of a terrific 1939 travel book by the aristocratic French adventurer Gontran de Poncins, who spent a year living with the indigenous people of the Canadian Arctic, gradually coming to respect their ways. But for most of its literary history, the Arctic has been empty space. When I ask him about the attractions of an Arctic setting, Donald says that it's ""the isolation… the fact that you're locked in… the Arctic is a wonderful intensifier."" Good conditions for sitcoms, and also for horror stories. Donald had originally intended to write a horror film - his primary influences being John Carpenter's 1982 movie The Thing, in which a parasitical alien lifeform emerged from the ice, and Dan Simmons's novel The Terror, in which the American horror writer speculated on the fate of Captain Franklin's ill-fated 1840s expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In Simmons's 2007 novel, the survivors are stalked by a supernatural creature, and the author won't have been the first to connect the Arctic with monsters - in fact the link has an impeccable provenance in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, with its first and last scenes set on the polar ice cap. ""I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation,"" says Robert Walton, the narrator of Shelley's Gothic novel. ""It ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. The sun is forever visible… there the snow and frost are banished."" Fat chance of that, but then Shelley, as late as the 19th-century, was merely reflecting an idyllic vision of the Arctic handed down by the Ancient Greeks, with their mythical Hyperborea, where the north wind (the ""borea"") came from. Counter-intuitively, the Greeks believed that at the very top of the world sat a tropical paradise set in balmy seas. Talk about packing the wrong clothes. The polar ice cap of course is nothing but frozen sea - shrinking and expanding according to the seasons - and a scientific impossibility according to those kings and queens who funded expeditions to find a northern sea passage to China and India. The Elizabethan privateer Martin Frobisher was among the first of these entrepreneurs, and Frobisher's insistence that the tusked narwhals he encountered were a species of unicorn must have seemed entirely plausible to the 16th-century mind. Other tales spoke of pygmies, dragons, epic whirlpools and of a mysterious black rock that stood at the North Pole itself. Believers in a hollow earth - who thought there was another world beneath this one's surface - held the entrance to this nether world would be found in the Arctic. But those hardy realists, the whalers, reignited interest in the Northwest Passage when they reported that the ice cap was melting. It may be a case of the literary imagination pre-empting events that the year of Frankenstein's publication, 1818, also saw the first serious British polar expedition in more than 100 years, as Sir John Ross undertook the first of three trips around the Canadian Arctic islands - the final 1850 voyage being undertaken to look for his naval colleague, Sir John Franklin, whose mysterious fate gripped the world for the next decade. Jack London was the most celebrated Victorian-Edwardian chronicler of the hardships of life in the Arctic, with his two classics set amid the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon - Call of the Wild and White Fang. A more contemporary account of the difficulties - physical and psychological - posed by early Arctic exploration are offered in the aforementioned Dark Matter, Michelle Paver's 2010 ghost story that follows a 1930s expedition into the heart of darkness of a polar winter. Paver's novel, which is currently being turned into a film by the makers of Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, is in a long line of fiction that imagines there is something malevolent out there in the snow. Fred Schepisi's 1984 thoughtful sci-fi flick, Iceman, depicts a prehistoric man whose body is thawed out of the ice after 40,000 years - a modern-day Frankenstein's monster - misunderstood, frightened and alone. In the 2007 Josh Hartnett movie 30 Days of Night, a small Alaskan town is besieged by vampires, while in the current television series Helix, a team investigates a viral outbreak at an arctic bio-research station, only to discover that genetic boffins are transforming humans in a nefarious way. At the end of the Second World War, one of the more outré theories concerning renegade Nazis was that they had holed up in the Arctic - home of their Aryan descendants according to the mystics of the Thule Society, who believed that blond-haired, blue-eyed Europeans did not emerge out of Africa, but from a long-vanished race of northern supermen (Himmler was, needless to say, a keen supporter of this theory). And when the flying-saucer phenomenon first emerged in the late 1940s, one particularly imaginative magazine editor hypothesised that they were the experimental warplanes of these fugitive Nazis. The frosty tentacles of the Cold War eventually embraced the polar north, too. It was a strange irony of the clash of the two mid-20th century superpowers that while they fought their proxy wars in Africa and South-east Asia, their own landmasses abutted in the Arctic, a short 50-mile hop across the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska. The maps in Dr Strangelove that trace the progress of the intercontinental nuclear warplanes brought home the proximity. A year before Stanley Kubrick's classic satire, Alistair Maclean's adventure novel Ice Station Zebra (filmed in 1968 with Rock Hudson) exploited the public's fascination with nuclear submarines and their ability to sail underneath the Arctic ice. Maclean returned to an Arctic setting with his 1971 murder mystery Bear Island - whose plot was substantially altered in the 1978 film of the same name (starring Donald Sutherland and Vanessa Redgrave), to include one of the earliest storylines involving climate change. What unites all these stories is their sense of the Arctic as a hostile and empty wasteland, visited only by a handful of intrepid European and American explorers. What they tend to ignore is the native Inuit of Greenland, Canada and Alaska, and the smaller Yupik population of Siberia and Alaska. It is a lack that has been redressed in more recent Arctic fiction, most notably in Danish writer Peter Hoeg's inspired 1992 novel Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow, with its spunky eponymous half-Greenlander heroine. In Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner - the first ever feature written and acted entirely in Inuktitut and the top-grossing Canadian movie of 2002 - the action is set in the ancient past and retells an Inuit legend where the monster is an ill-willed shaman. So where are today's yearned-for empty spaces? Space itself? Too remote for anyone except Richard Branson. Cyberspace? Too populous, although some people deprived of their internet might possibly feel like Sir John Franklin as ice entombed his ship. Meanwhile, intercontinental airliners hourly criss-cross the continent, mining companies sniff out oil and gas, satellites map every inch and even middle-income tourists can watch the Northern Lights or take their children to pester Santa Claus. But, as American archaeologist Robert McGhee puts it in his 2007 book The Last Imaginary Place: A Human History of the Arctic World: ""The legend of the Arctic as a distant paradise has been with us since the time of Homer, and a myth of such antiquity will not fade away merely because of the ephemeral reports of a few Arctic explorers, or the scanning eyes of satellites."" 'Fortitude' begins on Sky Atlantic on Thursday 29 January at 9pm."

BP CHIEF'S WARNING AFTER Â£645M LOSS,Norway,"BP slumped to a 969 million US dollar (£645 million) loss in the final quarter of 2014 as boss Bob Dudley said the company faced a ""challenging phase of low oil prices"". Mr Dudley said the focus was on ""resetting"" BP for the new reality of lower prices as he slashed investment plans for 2015 by as much as 6 billion US dollars (£4 billion). The replacement cost loss compares with a profit of 1.51 billion US dollars (£1 billion) for the same period last year. On an underlying basis, BP's replacement cost profit for the final three months of 2014 was 2.24 billion US dollars (£1.49 billion). But this was dragged down by a 3.6 billion US dollar (£2.4 billion) charge to account for factors including the ""near-term lower oil price environment"". The price of a barrel of Brent crude has slumped by more than half since last summer and fell to nearly 45 US dollars last month though it has seen a partial rebound in recent days to 55 US dollars. Mr Dudley said: ""We have now entered a new and challenging phase of low oil prices through the near and medium term. ""Our focus must now be on resetting BP: managing and rebalancing our capital programme and cost base for the new reality of lower prices while always maintaining safe, reliable and efficient operations."" mfl Annual replacement cost profit for 2014 was down 66% to 8.07 billion US dollars (£5.37 billion), while on an underlying basis it was down 10% to 12.14 billion US dollars (£8.08 billion). Despite the loss for the latest period, the oil giant - a mainstay of UK pension funds - announced a quarterly dividend of 10 cents (6.7p) per share, to be paid in March. Mr Dudley said: ""Throughout the work to reset BP, the dividend remains the first priority within our financial framework."" The company said it was ""now taking action to respond to the likelihood of oil prices remaining low into the medium term"". Shares responded positively, climbing by 6% on opening. BP said it planned to reduce spending on exploration and postpone projects in its upstream business - which includes oil and natural gas field development, production, storage and processing. It will also mothball some projects in its downstream operations - the part of the business that includes refineries and manufacturing as well as fuel marketing and global oil supply. As a result capital expenditure will total 20 billion US dollars (£13 billion) this year, a fifth lower than previous guidance of 24-26 billion US dollars (£16-17 billion), the group said. BP also said it would continue its divestments, of which it has agreed 4.7 billion (£3.1 billion) since 2013, with the total expected to double to 10 billion US dollars (£6.7 billion) by the end of 2015. It added that total cash costs for last year fell by more than 1 billion US dollars (£670 million) and it was ""in action to deliver further efficiencies in 2015"". The company, which employs 15,000 people in the UK, said last month that it would cut 300 North Sea jobs following a review of its operations. BP's results come a day after US rival Exxon Mobil said fourth quarter earnings fell by 21% due to the sharp slump in oil prices. mfl BP's underlying earnings from Rosneft - the Russian oil firm in which it has a 20% stake - fell by 57% to 470 million US dollars (£313 million). The result was affected by the fall in the oil price though foreign exchange effects had a ""favourable impact"" over a period when the rouble plummeted. Meanwhile, BP was still counting the cost of the blow-out of the Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010 which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, damaging fishing and tourism as well as marine and wildlife habitats. It added another 477 million US dollar (£318 million) charge for the fourth quarter to cover litigation costs, additional business economic loss claims and the ongoing costs of the Gulf Coast Restoration Organisation. BP's total charge to date for the spill is 43.5 billion US dollars (£29 billion). Elsewhere in the sector, exploration firm BG today took an 8.9 billion US dollar (£5.9 billion) hit, mainly driven by the slump in global commodity prices, as it reported a 5.03 billion US dollar (£3.35 billion) loss for the fourth quarter. It is also said that its planned capital expenditure for 2015 would be ""significantly lower"" than last year, falling between 6-7 billion US dollars (£4-£4.7 billion). BG outline its sensitivity to the fluctuating price of oil by revealing that a one US dollar movement had a 60-70 million US dollar (£40-47 million) impact on earnings. The group said new chief executive Helge Lund - hired from Norway's Statoil amid a row over his high pay package - was expected to join shortly. BG was created in 1997 when British Gas demerged into two separately-listed companies, with Centrica having responsibility for the retail side of the business. mfl"

Faroe Islands Takes Nordic Cuisine to the Limits,Norway,"I remember the potato. It had looked so ordinary, its bland familiarity a comforting contrast to the spread of unusual delicacies that greeted me upon my arrival in the Faroe Islands, the remote archipelago between Norway and Iceland. While most of the tourists come for the natural beauty—the windswept vistas, craggy gorges and adorably chubby seabirds—I’d traveled all the way from Tokyo to learn about Faroese cuisine and how it’s transforming into a new style of refined cooking. Three hours after leaving Copenhagen, I found myself on the edge of a cliff overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic, sitting at a table in a small, wooden hut covered with a turf roof. The hut, used for curing meat and fish, belonged to the restaurant Koks, the area’s top fine-dining establishment, located inside the sleek Hotel Føroyar in the capital city of Tórshavn. A whole leg of skerpikjøt—air-dried and fermented lamb—hung from a rod beside the door, along with aged cheese, pilot whale meat and loaf of garnatálg, a rolled sausage made from sheep’s fat and innards. The Koks team had wanted to show me the roots of the islands’ food culture. After explaining the region’s specialties, Johannes Jensen, managing director of the Hotel Føroyar, offered me a platter of waxy new potatoes and instructed me to place one atop a canapé of fermented pilot whale and a square of salt-cured whale blubber the size of a pat of butter. “First the whale meat, then the blubber and last the potato,” he said, layering the ingredients on his plate. The whale meat was the color of onyx, arranged in thin slices that resembled black truffles. The translucent pieces of blubber looked like miniature daikon-radish cakes and gave off a faintly floral aroma. The potato was a potato. “Now, into the mouth,” he said with a chuckle, chewing merrily. “Into the mouth,” I echoed. Living in Japan, I’d encountered whale before in many guises—raw as sashimi (reminiscent of venison), cured as “bacon” (gamy as well as fishy), simmered in dashi broth (persistently metallic) and marinated in soy sauce and sake before being deep-fried (ironically, my least favorite iteration). But I’d never had it prepared in the traditional Faroese way, hung to dry and ferment in the salty sea air until it’s reached the consistency of soft jerky. This technique of preserving fish and meat is unique to the islands (before the 1800s, the Faroes didn’t produce or import much salt), a result of the region’s geographic and climatic conditions as well as the scarcity that has historically defined life on the islands. Within seconds my palate was flooded with a cacophony of intense flavors. High-toned treble notes of herbaceous and floral flavors were followed by deeply funky, musky earthiness. The texture was thick and oily, and the potato had prolonged the act of chewing it. The experience remains firmly fixed in my memory. “It’s an acquired taste,” Jensen shrugged, before adding with a note of concern, “I hope we haven’t shocked you.” Shocked, no. Confounded, yes. But to say that pilot whale was the most unusual thing that I ate during my time on the Faroes would be false. Almost all of the food was unlike anything I’d ever tasted before. There were turnips so sweet that they reminded me of Asian pears; horse mussels the size of my palm, with orange flesh the texture of custard; and langoustine with crystalline meat that tasted of the sea. Faroese fermented foods offered an entirely different spectrum of visceral flavors: dried lamb laced with the tang of blue cheese, and the indescribable pungency of cured whale meat and blubber. Faroese food culture is a culinary distillation of nature’s extremes, a reflection of the contradictions inherent in the environment. On the Faroe Islands, the psychedelic green landscape is veined with streams and waterfalls but nearly devoid of trees. Although the stormy weather regularly turns planes back to Bergen or Copenhagen, the sky can suddenly explode with sunlight, shooting rainbows in every direction. My fascination with the Faroe Islands began two years ago, when my friend Adrien Norwood, an American chef based in Denmark, mentioned that he was going there to do a pop-up cooking event with the avant-garde Scandinavian chefs’ collective NaCL. Thanks in large part to René Redzepi and his restaurant Noma, Nordic cuisine has become a global phenomenon, attracting an unprecedented number of food tourists to Copenhagen and launching offshoots abroad. Noma has even set up shop in Tokyo, albeit temporarily, for a residency at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel from January 9 to February 14. In recent years, New Nordic enthusiasts have started exploring the culinary terrain beyond the Danish capital. Even so, I’d remarked, the Faroe Islands, with its scant population of 50,000 people, seemed like an unlikely destination for gourmets. “The products are amazing,” Norwood replied, describing the giant cod and succulent langoustines. Almost more intriguing, though, were the idiosyncratic dried and fermented foods, which have been made the same way since the 600s. I couldn’t imagine what they tasted like. “It’s a full-on experience,” he told me. “I don’t think you can duplicate a lot of the things on the Faroe Islands outside of the Faroe Islands. You don’t have the same wind blowing, the same saltwater going through the streams under those little wooden shacks.” Faroese preserved foods were born of necessity. Winters on the islands are long and frigid, and even during the temperate summer months, very little grows. According to University of the Faroe Islands professor Jóan Pauli Joensen, who has written a book on the local food culture, prior to the arrival of tubers and root vegetables, edible plants cultivated on the Faroe Islands had been limited to a handful of species, mainly barley and the herb angelica, which was the primary source of vitamin C for early settlers. Sheep, fowl and seafood were the archipelago’s most abundant resources. But without a ready supply of timber, cooking with fire was considered something of a luxury. “Basically, you had drying and fermenting. That’s it,” Joensen said, reminding me that salt was scarce on the islands. The Faroese made “black salt” from dried seaweed, but it wasn’t suitable for preserving food. In light of these challenges, the idea of creating haute cuisine based on Faroese products sounds like a quixotic endeavor, but Leif Sørensen, the region’s most famous culinary personality and former head chef at Koks, has made it his life’s mission for nearly a decade. When I met him in Copenhagen, he was en route back to the Faroes from Greenland, where he’d been researching how to develop the food culture there. Over a couple of beers, he described the uphill battle he had faced on the Faroe Islands. The restaurant scene had been nonexistent until 1992, when the prohibition of alcoholic beverages was repealed, and had consisted mainly of steakhouses using imported ingredients. At his first restaurant, he ran into trouble sourcing fresh local fish because the industry was focused on exports. Procuring meat was equally difficult due to government restrictions. On top of it all, the Faroese guests “didn’t want to come to eat Faroese dishes” because they saw it as “food for poor people.” But Sørensen is an optimist, although a pragmatic one. While he appears somber at first, he has an easy laugh and a deadpan sense of humor. When talking about the history of food on the islands, a lot of Faroese use two phrases to describe the alternating states of scarcity and plenty that have defined the culinary culture: “It was terrible” and “It was a feast.” Those familiar expressions came up as Sørensen recounted funny anecdotes about the monotonous diet he endured as a child: fish, served fresh and then fermented, and then dried, in an endless rotation. Or dried whale meat “so tough it was like leather.” When he helped launch Koks in 2011, he tried to “tell the story of Faroese food in a contemporary way” by incorporating traditional ingredients as accents to the dishes. At the same time, he embarked on a project to classify the edible plants that grow wild on the islands and started cooking with seaweed, which, although plentiful, had not been eaten by the Faroese. In a sense, Sørensen has been doing more than telling the story of Faroese cuisine. He’s been rewriting it—and turning a tale of paucity into one of surprising bounty. Sørensen’s work has paved the way for a new wave of chefs on the islands, including his young protégé, Poul Andrias Ziska, who has helmed the kitchen at Koks since February. When I dined there in late August, the food Ziska served moved through the culinary history of the islands, artfully presenting the region’s staple ingredients. Cubes of beetroot were topped with angelica, while dots of salted fish were piped onto circles of mashed potato. The flavors I’d experienced at the start of my trip made an elegant return: The depth of skerpikjøt was rendered as translucent, feather-light crisps, and a thin layer of garnatálg was roasted over potatoes in a smoky cheese sauce (fermented whale hadn’t made it onto the menu, to my relief). At the end of summer, the focus was on seafood: crab, veiled in thinly sliced turnips and drizzled with a concentrated crab oil, and langoustine, lightly smoked in hay and quickly pan-fried so that it was still rare in the center. A dish of sweet scallops and cauliflower had been dusted with a fine powder of sea tangle seaweed that gave off a flavor and aroma reminiscent of truffles. Before leaving the restaurant, I took one last look at the city of Tórshavn below. With its gently twinkling lights and quiet harbor, the view was so different from the chaotic, neon cityscape I was accustomed to in Tokyo. In the distance lay an island shaped like a whale, and beyond that, the rest of the world. I couldn’t help feeling that I’d landed at the edge of the earth, a place of improbable possibilities. “I’m sure you would like whale meat if you tasted my recipe,” Sørensen later joked. Maybe."

Because thousands of people showed up for 600 jobs on the October morning last year, scores of applicants were forced to wait outside under the blistering sun. Things went from testy to unruly as the temperature neared 32 degrees; Sandals had no choice but to call the cops. The chaos is one face of the ugly downturn sweeping through the Caribbean. Though the global financial crisis technically ended a few years ago, its punishing aftershocks are still being felt—and they're amplified on island states that depend on tourist dollars for support. Countries like the Bahamas and Barbados are marketed as idyllic vacation spots with white sand beaches, but their local economies are anything but serene. In the Bahamas, the unemployment rate was 15.7% at the start of February—higher than in Portugal, one of Europe's worst-hit economies, and well over double Canada's rate. The situation is even worse in Barbados—and arguably even more surprising, since the loyalty of British tourists to “Little England"" had seemed to be bred in the bone. The colonial tie meant little during the financial crisis, and the resulting downturn drove Barbados's debt load to nearly 100% of its gross domestic product. Struggling to pay the bills, the government fired 3,000 public servants last year. It's also gone cap in hand to hotel developers, offering major tax concessions to spur investment—hence the scene at Sandals. Financial institutions are, of course, at the epicentre of this storm. Take the case of Sagicor Financial Corp., a leading regional life insurer, based in Barbados. Because the country's sovereign debt has been downgraded several times, Sagicor's corporate debt rating has also suffered. In January, the company abruptly announced it was relocating its head office outside of Barbados, shocking the island's 290,000 citizens. Canadian lenders have it even worse. Our banks are often praised for sidestepping the U.S. mortgage crisis and for avoiding the ugly economic woes that still wreak havoc in Europe, but the truth is, they've hit trouble in paradise. Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are by far the Caribbean's three largest lenders, dominating both personal and commercial banking. Combined, they've written off more than $1 billion in the region since the Great Recession. To stanch the bleeding, the banks have been restructuring their regional operations by shrinking their footprints and by leaning on specific countries, such as energy-rich Trinidad and Tobago, to drive growth. At first it seemed like a smart plan, but then energy prices plummeted. Some 45% of Trinidad's GDP comes from the energy industry, as do 80% of its exports. Shareholders barely noticed when Canada's banks started suffering from this tropical malaise five years ago. Because the Big Six lenders were on a tear, many of their mistakes were glossed over. Bank CEOs, however, have warned that the bull run is waning. Spooked by spiralling writeoffs, investors repeatedly asked bank chiefs about the region at a major industry conference in January. More than anything, they simply want to know what the hell is happening in the backyard of Canadian banking. CANADA'S COMMERCIAL TIES TO THE CARIBBEAN RUN DEEP. Starting in 1864, the group that founded Merchant's Bank in Halifax financed trade with British-owned islands in the Antilles. Ships leaving Canada packed with timber and flour returned home with sugar, rum and cotton. Scotiabank planted roots in the British West Indies, as they were then known, by opening a branch in Jamaica in 1889. RBC began its Caribbean foray even earlier, in 1882, and CIBC set up shop in Barbados and Jamaica in 1920. Canadians were so enamoured with the region that Prime Minister Robert Borden talked to his British counterpart, David Lloyd George, about taking over some islands in 1919 (or so legend has it). For all that history, our banks are sometimes still chided for being from afar. “Everybody always talks about these ‘foreign banks,' "" says Anya Schnoor, a Jamaican who runs Scotiabank Trinidad. ""I always say to everybody: If you've been in a region 125 years, we've kind of gone beyond"" that line of reasoning. The Canadian banks used to face tough competition from the likes of Barclays and Citibank, but that started to change at the turn of the century. In 2001, CIBC combined its regional operations with Barclays' to form FirstCaribbean International Bank; five years later, CIBC bought out Barclays' remaining stake for just over $1 billion (U.S.). It was the largest deal of CEO Gerry McCaughey's era. While Scotiabank largely opted for organic growth, investing in its local wealth and insurance arms, RBC inked its own acquisition in 2007, buying back Trinidad's RBTT Financial Group for $2.2 billion (U.S.). (RBC originally owned RBTT, but sold it to public shareholders in the late ‘80s.) Each of these investments seemed promising at the time. With tourism booming and energy prices soaring, economic growth was robust—between 2000 and 2007, Trinidad and Tobago's averaged slightly over 8% annually. The region's profit margins were also fat, particularly in lending. By 2008, the three Canadian banks had $42 billion in assets across the English Caribbean—2.5% of their combined total assets, but more than four times those held by the 40-odd locally owned banks. With such a dominant footprint, RBC, Scotiabank and CIBC hardly had to spend to build brand awareness—they could milk money just by being there. In 2007 CIBC FirstCaribbean made $256 million (U.S.), contributing 7% of the bank's total profit. Then the financial crisis hit. At first, the pain wasn't too severe because Brits, Canadians and Americans didn't cancel the vacations they had booked before the crash. But in 2010, Jamaica became the first to blink, turning to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. Almost four years later, Barbados did the same when its central bank nearly ran out of its precious foreign exchange reserves. The government is now working on a restructuring plan with the IMF, which means two of the region's three traditional economic powerhouses can't support themselves. Scotiabank was the first financial institution to acknowledge the pain. As the lead lender to a developer that bought resorts on Cable Beach in the Bahamas, the bank suffered a $75-million hit on its $200-million loan in 2010. Through a complex restructuring, a Chinese bank stepped in to bail out the developer, ultimately financing a project comprising six hotels, a 100,000-square-foot casino, 200,000 square feet of convention facilities and an 18-hole golf course. A year later, CIBC wrote down its investment in FirstCaribbean by $203 million. It was then largely quiet until January, 2014, when RBC shocked its peers with plans to sell its Jamaican operations to Sagicor, incurring a $100-million loss. The year since has been chock full of charges and pullbacks, including another $420-million writedown of FirstCaribbean's goodwill; the closing of RBC's Caribbean wealth management business; and scores of loan-loss provisions from all three lenders. Today, more than half of CIBC's total gross impaired loans—or loans that show any signs of trouble—originate in the Caribbean. At Scotiabank, the equivalent share is 35%. In other words, this tiny cluster of islands has the potential to generate bigger writeoffs than both banks' monstrous Canadian lending portfolios. As for RBC, 11% of its Caribbean lending portfolio is impaired, versus just 0.33% of its equivalent Canadian business. Now we know why Caribbean loan margins were so fat: The outsized returns reflected higher risk. In finance, after all, there is no free lunch. WHAT STARTED AS A CORPORATE LEND-ing problem has morphed into a mortgagemarket meltdown. Consumer credit is also suffering. Just before Christmas, RBC took another $50-million charge related to its Caribbean residential mortgage book, while CIBC has warned that further FirstCaribbean writedowns could come. Before the crisis, foreigners piled into Barbados, buying up properties on the island's west coast. The boom was so fierce that a luxury mall—Limegrove Lifestyle Centre—was built, attracting tenants such as Cartier and Louis Vuitton. Developments like the Port Ferdinand luxury marina, which can house 120 vessels up to 18 metres long each, also sprung up. Today, however, both are surrounded by properties with “For Sale"" signs. The situation is eerily similar in the Bahamas, where it would take more than a decade to unload all the foreclosed properties at the average annual rate of home sales. Much of this mess dates back to practices put in place years ago—in some cases, before the Canadian banks made their Caribbean acquisitions. “The credit adjudication of RBTT left a lot to be desired,"" says Richard Young, the former head of Scotiabank Trinidad, who retired in 2012. “I used to compete with them, so I knew the type of stuff they were doing."" If, for example, a client had a good relationship with a branch manager, he or she could simply call up and get extra credit, regardless of their banking profile. “The customers loved it."" FirstCaribbean, meanwhile, was happy to lend during a property boom. There was a belief in Barbados that real estate prices would go up by 10% a year. Believing the hype was bad enough, but once the bubble popped, CIBC was left holding bad loans tied to houses and land. Although each bank now has its own restructuring plan, the common denominator is the need to lower costs. Since revenues aren't growing, savings have to come from slashing expenses. That's easier said than done. RBC, for example, operates in 18 countries and territories in the region. It is governed by 17 regulators and deals in eight currencies. Negotiating layoffs and centralizing back-office functions is a nightmare. To make matters worse, the Caribbean is an inefficient market. In Trinidad, people joke about waiting years to receive a tax refund. Roads are so bad that getting around a capital like Port of Spain takes a major chunk out of the workday. Such inefficiencies have crept into the banking sector. Mobile banking barely exists in the Caribbean. RBC's branch—or banking hall, in local lingo—in Port of Spain's Independence Square is one of the bank's biggest in the world; it has to be, because West Indians would rather wait in line than pay electronically. The effect on costs is brutal. A recent study of Trinidadian banks found that total operating costs averaged about 6% of total assets; the figure in the European Union was just 2%. Trinidad isn't alone. Until Scotiabank opened a new branch in Montego Bay, Jamaica, last fall, the lineup at its existing branch demonstrated that Jamaicans will wait an hour or more to deposit a cheque. The Canadian way of doing business is also at odds with Caribbean culture. Terrence Farrell is fluent in both worlds. A native Trinidadian who served as deputy governor of the country's central bank, he completed his PhD at the University of Toronto. Many West Indians, he says, will claim “God is a Trini"" or “God is a Bajan""—the slang names for Trinidadians and Barbadians. The meaning: ""We are fortunate; things will always work out for the best."" In Farrell's view, too many people think, “we don't need to make any effort, we don't need to plan, to harness our resources, to work hard."" West Indians also have incredible national pride. Canadians may view the Caribbean as one coherent region, but each island likes to take digs at the other, and in many cases they really don't trust one another. “Bajans operate on two speeds,"" according to a Trinidadian saying. “Slow, and slower."" SUCH CULTURAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE, OF COURSE, DEBAT-able. But bank investors can't ignore the hard facts of the Caribbean's underlying economic woes; nor can they ignore a changing regulatory landscape. For tourism, the Canadian, U.S. and U.K. economies finally look promising—maybe. “The truth is, you can get sun, sea and sand anywhere nowadays,"" warns Pamela Coke Hamilton, an American-educated lawyer who heads the Caribbean Export Development Agency, based in Barbados. It kills her to say it, because she was raised in Jamaica, but the Caribbean is one of the most expensive sun destinations to visit, and a recent IMF study found the region's share of global tourism is falling. Another major problem, Coke Hamilton says, is that the islands mostly offer the same thing, so they simply take tourists from one another. Today the Cayman Islands is a hot destination, siphoning off high-end tourists from Barbados and Bahamas. A few years from now, Cuba could be the sexy spot—especially if U.S. developers pile in. Coke Hamilton argues that each country must develop a unique strategy. Health City Cayman Islands, for instance, opened in 2014, designed to lure North Americans looking to shorten surgery wait times, for a price. On the regulatory front, a recent crackdown on tax evasion, particularly by U.S. lawmakers, has forced banks to abide by new rules. In 2010, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act became law, holding financial institutions to much tougher reporting standards for offshore assets. Barbados and the Cayman Islands had been well known as tax havens, giving Westerners good reason to do business and to own properties there. Globally, regulators are also getting tougher on money laundering—which is done, among other channels, through offshore accounts in the Caribbean—and that's made banks think twice. As for the energy market, prices aren't expected to rebound any time soon—which means Trinidad is in trouble. In January, American and British energy explorers were still chatting over rum punches in Port of Spain's hotel bars, but that could quickly change. The country's lack of economic diversity has a price. “In Canada, you'll have a hit in certain provinces, but [the country] can absorb it a little easier,"" says Reshard Mohammed, chief financial officer of Scotiabank Trinidad. In his country, “a prolonged issue will be more problematic."" Trinidad does have some substantial buffers—its unemployment rate is just 3.2% and its “A"" sovereign debt rating is the highest in the Caribbean. But Farrell, who is a director at Trinidadian lender Republic Bank, warns that the government didn't save much for a rainy day. Norway, he points out, started producing oil in the 1970s, and its sovereign wealth fund is now worth almost $900 billion (U.S.); Trinidad has been producing energy for 100 years, but its equivalent fund is worth just $5 billion. (Of course, Alberta's isn't much better, relatively speaking.) SOME BANKS ARE MORE WILLING TO ADMIT MISSTEPS than others. “It's fair to say that there were some mistakes we made around leadership and the business model,"" says Kirk Dudtschak, RBC's head of Caribbean banking since 2013. When RBC bought RBTT, it had dreams of creating a pan-Caribbean bank, a strategy that entailed eliminating individual country heads in favour of a central command. It took five years before management realized they had lost the pulse of each island, and then reinstalled local leaders, starting in 2013. While not as candid, Scotiabank has also discussed the region's problems for some time—though chief executive Brian Porter, who once ran the lender's international banking arm, joked at the January investor conference that no one cared until now. “The Caribbean has been under a fair degree of stress for seven years and I talked about it,"" he told the audience, but “nobody really asked me any questions."" Because there now are questions, the banks try to calm investors by stressing that the English-speaking Caribbean is on an upswing as tourism levels rebound somewhat. (Puerto Rico, by contrast, is in its eighth year of recession.) Given the region's strong economic ties to the U.S., it also augurs well that the American economy is heating up. The banks can also point to their cost-cutting. Scotiabank is closing branches across the Caribbean; CIBC, which declined to comment for this story because it is working on restructuring plans, has talked about tightening its operation, which is currently spread across 17 islands; and RBC recently installed a Common Caribbean Operating Model to increase efficiency, instituting charges such as a small teller fee to wean customers off in-person banking. Under these initiatives, head counts are falling at all the banks. RBC's Caribbean work force is less then 5,000, compared to 6,500 people two years ago. “Many parts of the region are in a deep or long-term recession,"" Dudtschak says. “Everything we're doing is about repositioning our business within the current economic environment…to ensure our business is sustainable for the long term."" The elephant in the room is whether any lenders will cut and run altogether. RBC, after all, did it once before. The Canadian giant originally owned RBTT but sold it during the 1980s when Trinidad was hit by plunging energy prices. For now, RBC and its peers tell anyone who asks that they have no plans to leave. They say they've been in the region for more than a century and remain deeply committed. After a while, however, their responses sound as rehearsed as an American politician being asked about presidential ambitions. At this point, sources say the chances of a major sale are slim because buyers are hard to come by. Global banks such as HSBC and Citibank are shrinking their footprints. Private equity players may poke around from time to time, but they often get spooked once they start digging through financials, according to a source familiar with the Canadian banks' operations. For instance, some islands don't keep adequate digital records (or any digital records) of their housing appraisals, so anyone trying to assess the banks' loan portfolios must bring in armies of people to dig through file folders. Until buyers materialize with a reasonable offer, the most likely outcome is that the banks will continue to prune. But shrinking is expensive and arduous, involving wrestling with regulators, cancelling property leases and paying severance packages, among other things. If Canada's banks are lucky, the U.S. economy will keep gathering steam. If not, they should find solace knowing they've been here before, and it eventually got better. Trinidad reeled when oil prices crashed in the 1980s; Jamaica is in a perpetual relationship with the IMF; and Barbados has long been at the whim of tourist dollars. However, those facts haven't quelled speculation that one of the Canadian banks could pull the plug—especially when all three have new CEOs. CIBC is considered to have the highest flight risk. Former CEO McCaughey, who doubled down in the region, retired last year, as did former COO Richard Nesbitt, who oversaw the Caribbean operation. The region is now under the watch of retail banking head David Williamson, and he already has his hands full trying to turn around CIBC's Canadian operation. RBC is more of an enigma. The bank is taking its restructuring seriously; that could mean that it wants to run the division long-term, or, like someone who wants to sell a house, is renovating simply in hopes of fetching a better price. Scotiabank, meanwhile, is considered the most likely to stay. It is, after all, Canada's most international bank, and its Caribbean operation is widely regarded as the region's most efficient. Besides, Scotiabank has endured much worse in countries such as Argentina and Venezuela; it remains profitable in the Caribbean. For all these reasons, the place, and its tilting fortunes, may well be woven into the bank's DNA."
"US Navy Deploys Drones Under Arctic Ice, Competes With Russia for Waterways",Norway,"The US Navy has started to deploy underwater drones beneath the arctic ice both to study the deterioration of the ice sheet due to climate change and to help plan for anticipated increases in traffic as previously frozen waterways open up.[http://sputniknews.com/images/] In terms of environmental monitoring, the drones will measure salinity and temperature, for instance, which will help scientists create more accurate models to predict future rates of melting. But the plans are also meant to address the ""security implications"" of the opening up of the Arctic waters, according to the Navy's Arctic Roadmap, updated in 2014 to adapt to changing Arctic conditions. Part of that plan, which spans 2014-2030, is to increase the number of ships in the region, Martin Jeffries, science advisor to the Office of Naval Research, or ONR, told Military​.com. ""Due to the significant retreat of sea ice, previously unreachable areas have started to open for maritime use several weeks each year. The predicted rise in oil and gas development, fishing, tourism, and mineral mining could alter the Regions strategic importance as Arctic and non-Arctic nations make investments,"" the Roadmap says. The two aspects of the are connected, as the rate of melting will determine how many more ships are deployed in the region and how quickly. The drones will focus specifically on what is known as the marginalized zone - where the solid ice shelf meets the ocean - the frontier of the Arctic ice. What weve been seeing in recent years is a much greater retreat of the sea ice cover in the summer time such that in the last eight years, weve seen the eight lowest minimum ice extent values in the arctic in the satellite record going back to 1979, said Jeffries. - J. Patrick Malone (@JPatrickMalone) March 8, 2015 Drone Designers? Talk to DARPA. One underwater drone currently in use has been the Seaglider - a 110-pound, 2.8-meter submersible whose audio sensors can reach a depth of 1,000 meters where they record their precise location with audio ""pings"" and help build an accurate picture of temperature and salinity changes. We can deploy robotic technologies for sustained autonomous observing over many months - to observe the ocean, the ice and the atmosphere. Doing this with high navigation accuracy makes the scientific value of the data much greater, said Jeffries. By the end of the summer in 2014, the science team had deployed over 100 robotic platforms in the ice and the ocean. - IDST (@idst36) March 4, 2015 But the US Defense Department is hoping for much more advanced drone technology in the future and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA recently announced an open call to developers for unmanned vehicles with sensors to monitor the area and alert authorities to potential problems in the region. DARPA has up to $4 million dollars ready for those who might produce unmanned vehicles that meet its needs. The agency wants ""environmentally friendly"" vehicles that both fly and swim and which can go up to 30 days without recharging since access to the electrical grid is restricted in the Arctic. Competition Heats Up as Ice Melts The push into the Arctic is also a reaction against Russian moves to secure their interests in the Arctic and the Russian Navy's similar plans to increase their own presence in the region. Not only will the thawing ice shelf open up shorter, lucrative shipping routes, but also oil and gas reserves of great, though not precisely known, value. Russias revised military doctrine, signed by President Vladimir Putin in December 2014, for the first time ever named the protection of national interests in the Arctic among the main priorities for its armed forces in times of peace. Part of that has been to resume a permanent military presence and Russia has reopened a military base on the Novosibirsk Islands. Though the extent of the natural resources in the Arctic is currently unclear, oil and gas explorers are hoping the new thawing frontier will be a boon to their industries. Estimates are that the Arctic could hold as much as 13% of the world's undiscovered but recoverable oil, with that figure rising to 30% for gas. There have already been disputes about how far a country's influence extends among the five Arctic nations - Canada, Norway, Russia, Denmark through Greenland, and the United States through Alaska. Under international law those countries' Exclusive Economic Zones are limited to 200 nautical miles off their shores. Russia has claimed the ocean floor as an extension of the Siberian continental shelf all the way to the North Pole, where an underwater expedition symbolically dropped a Russian flag on the sea bed in 2007."
Solutions for Alberta's petro-budget woes: Olive,Norway,"Jim Prentice would appear to be a brave man among career politicians. Some time in the next two weeks, the Alberta premier will go to the polls seeking a mandate for one of the most radical budgets in his province’s history. It is an austerity budget that, among other miseries[http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/02/23/alberta-zeros-in-on-public-services-as-oil-price-crashes.html], cuts Alberta Health Services by $286 million in funding and 1,700 jobs. Tabled late last month in response to a drastic 68 per cent plunge in oil-and-gas royalty revenue, Prentice’s budget also calls for almost 60 higher taxes and fees, and a new health tax. Prentice will go to the people tied in the polls with the Wildrose Party. He will have to answer for a Progressive Conservative economic stewardship that now burdens Albertans with a record deficit for 2015-16 estimated by the Prentice government at $7 billion, or $1,707 per Albertan, compared with just $795 per person in Ontario. And that is a rosy forecast, assuming an average world oil price this year of $65 (U.S.), considerably higher than, say, TD Bank’s estimate of $52. Under Tory rule, Alberta has lost its prized debt-free status. And if epic deficits continue, becoming a structural shortfall, borrowing to service debt could turn Alberta into a have-not province by the next fiscal year, TD Bank warns. And Prentice has audaciously blamed Albertans for their fiscal crisis. Albertans have for decades tolerated, if not encouraged, a mismatch of the highest spending on government services of any province (about $1,300 per citizen) and the lowest personal and corporate taxes in the country. Albertans have elected a succession of fiscally irresponsible governments, which have also failed to emulate Norway and Alaska in adequately building a rainy day fund with oil and gas royalties. So Albertans should “look in a mirror,” Prentice said recently, if they want to know why their province is in fiscal straitjacket. Prentice will win the election. Albertans, averse to political change, have kept the Tories in power for 43 years. Wildrose is in disarray, helmed by a neophyte leader and still smarting from the defection last year of 11 of its legislators to the Tories. Prentice is a veteran of Alberta politics who held several cabinet posts in the Harper Government before taking a top-level job in banking. Despite winning leadership just last year, Prentice has already improved his party’s standing with a public disenchanted over the fiasco of the brief Alison Redford premiership. What Prentice likely won’t have time to do in the short space of an election campaign is promote an overdue economic renaissance for his province. With a mandate from Alberta voters, perhaps he will. * Edmonton needs to raise royalties on Alberta’s petroleum wealth, aligning itself with other major oil-producing jurisdictions. That won’t be easy, given the fierce opposition from the Canadian oilpatch to then-premier Ed Stelmach’s 20 per cent increase in royalties in 2007. After a three-year climbdown, royalty rates were effectively back to where they’d been in 2007. Indeed, that controversy helped spur the creation of the ultra-conservative Wildrose Party, which became the Tories’ chief electoral nemesis. Thus Alberta remains at the giveaway end of the global resource royalties spectrum. In 2012, the Alberta-based Parkland Institute calculated that since 1986, the Alberta oilpatch had generated about $260 billion (Cdn.) in pretax profits from the tar sands alone, of which Albertans’ share was less than $25 billion — a sum that disappeared into the government’s general revenues. * Alberta needs to diversify its economy, one already blessed with thriving agriculture and tourism sectors. It is folly to allow GDP to fall hostage to outside forces over which one has no control, a lesson Alberta should have learned[http://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/02/09/alberta-tories-should-have-been-prepared-for-oil-crisis.html] from the prolonged 1980s oil slump. Texas did, transforming itself into a world-leading centre of aerospace and computing technology development. So did Pittsburgh, becoming a medical and environmental R&D; leader after its mainstay steel industry collapsed. Boise has emerged as a thriving high-tech hub generating start-up businesses despite its relatively remote location. There is a great future for substantial Alberta industries in environmental and telecommunications technologies, specialty manufacturing, and medical science R&D; — all of which have already established a base in the province. * Alberta can not continue to fund a significant portion of public services with non-renewable resource revenues. Resource royalties still account for about one-fifth of Alberta government revenues, down from an eye-popping one-third for a nine-year span starting in 1998. Like Norway, Alberta will have to both live within its means and look beyond the fossil-fuel sector to fund the provision of public services. Oil and gas are finite resources, obviously. And Eldar Saetre, head of Norway’s state oil producer Statoil, strikes a sobering note in explaining that the current cutbacks at his enterprise aren’t due solely to the calamitous drop in the world oil price. Statoil, he explains, is in a permanent slimdown phase, because of two factors: World oil supplies are gradually depleting, and fossil fuels are poised for replacement over the next two decades by alternative energy sources. Petro-economies will eventually be a thing of the past. * In the meantime, though, it’s not too late to bulk up the Heritage Fund as a safeguard against volatile economic cycles. Alberta’s sizeable agriculture industry is a cyclical commodities sector, too, after all. With daily oil production of 2.3 million barrels, Alberta produces more oil than Norway (1.9 million per day). But Oslo does not fund government activities with its oil wealth, as Alberta does. Norway’s oil-related receipts are contributed to the 25-year-old Government Pension Fund Global, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund with assets of more than $1.1 trillion (Cdn.). Though it rarely does so, Oslo is legally permitted to tap the fund, but only by 4 per cent of annual income per year, which leaves the principal untouched. Alberta’s last sage premier, Peter Lougheed, created the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund much earlier, in 1976. But Alberta stopped contributing to it just 11 years later. Edmonton also repeatedly raided the fund for special projects and everyday spending. The Heritage Fund thus has a comparatively measly $17 billion in assets. Assets of Alaska’s Permanent Fund, which pays each Alaskan a dividend of between $1,000 and $2,500 a year, now totals almost $68 billion (Cdn.) despite that annual payout. In a province-wide TV address last month, Prentice told Albertans that “one of the great mistakes we have made has been our commitment to let the Heritage Fund lapse.” The remedial steps above have been recommended many times over past decades by, among others, the left-leaning Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) and the right-leaning Fraser Institute. These measures, essential to Alberta’s future prosperity, have met with resistance each time they are broached, chiefly by a petroleum industry that has an outsized influence over the lives of 4.1 million Albertans. It is for Albertans, ultimately, to decide whether Big Oil will run their lives. Or if it is time finally to become, to borrow the apt Quebec motto, maître chez nous — masters of our own destiny."
"Geysers, Mushers and Sled Dogs Vie With Growth",Norway,"PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia -- When Vladislav Revenok, an Orthodox priest, first participated in the obscure Russian version of Alaska's Iditarod, he found himself in places so isolated that he was mobbed by villagers demanding to be baptized. They told him he was the first priest to visit the outback of the already remote Kamchatka Peninsula in about 50 years. ''Only a few small villages see us,'' Mr. Revenok, a veteran musher, said by telephone after finishing the arduous 17-day race in late March. ''When I arrive at the finish line and see all those people waiting -- journalists, the crowd, so many cars -- I feel like I am arriving back on a different planet.'' Kamchatka's very isolation once afforded a measure of protection for its astounding beauty: a crown of 300 volcanoes, including around 25 that are still active; a central valley of erupting geysers; rivers so red and so thick with spawning salmon that walking on water seems distinctly possible; oceans inhabited by crabs the size of turkeys. Even many locals do not know the peninsula that well. About 80 percent of the population lives in three southern cities. But isolation no longer provides the same insurance. Kamchatka is caught between ambitious plans to develop untapped resources like gold and oil, and efforts to preserve its natural splendor. Oil exploration has started in the Sea of Okhotsk, which separates the peninsula from mainland Russia, and the first natural gas wells now operate onshore. Two gold mines are already working, and 10 more are in the planning stages. Local officials want Petropavlovsk to become the main transit harbor for hulking container ships that can deflect ice as they ply the Arctic route between China and Europe. In addition, the government is trying to raise the number of tourists to 300,000 from 40,000 annually. Skeptics worry that the development plans threaten to overwhelm what amounts to a giant nature preserve about 750 miles long and 300 miles across at its widest point. ''The territory is not as big as Alaska,'' said Sergey Rafanov, the director of the World Wildlife Fund's local branch. ''Everything is compact here, and the interests of these various industries conflict. If you want to dog sled or to see volcanoes, will you come if there is a huge iron processing plant on the Pacific shore with two smokestacks?'' The problem, he said, is the lack of a master plan. Since the local government depends solely on federal funds, it is never sure which projects might be funded and hence plans each in isolation. Senior government officials vow to reconcile the competing demands. ''The quality of life of our population depends on the caliber of the protection measures. Why would we cut off the branch on which we are sitting?'' said Vladimir M. Galitsin, the minister of fisheries and the deputy chairman of the Kamchatka government. ''A sensible balance can be reached that both safeguards the natural resources and allows for the exploitation of various deposits.'' Environmentalists have doubts. Populations of the largest bears and big-horned sheep have already been decimated, they said, because trophy hunters from the United States and Europe were unleashed without regulations. A black market for Kamchatka falcons fetches $50,000 per bird in the Persian Gulf nations, Mr. Rafanov said. In Soviet times, Kamchatka was a naval base closed to foreigners. After the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the population gradually ebbed, dropping by around a third, to 300,000. To stem that flow, Kamchatka needs jobs and critical infrastructure, like an independent energy source. Volcanic steam powers a rare geothermal electric plant, but that supplies only 30 percent of local needs. The largest development schemes are likely to be shelved because of federal budget problems after a collapse in global oil prices. Fish, salmon roe and crabs constitute Kamchatka's most famous exports. Strained relations with the West and Japan meant foreign sales were down by a third, to 200,000 metric tons out of nearly 900,000 metric tons produced last year, Mr. Galitsin said. Kamchatkans hope that the Kremlin's retaliatory economic sanctions banning salmon and other fish from places like Norway will increase demand for their products in western Russia. The problem is distance. In the time before planes and trains, it could take a year to reach Kamchatka from Moscow. These days, logistical and bureaucratic hurdles still make it impossible to move fresh fish to western Russia on a regular basis. It has been said that Kamchatka is so far east of Moscow that it is practically west. The nine-hour flight from Moscow lasts almost three times longer than flights from Anchorage. (Those run only in the summer.) It is little wonder, then, that Kamchatkans look to Alaska for inspiration for everything from building a tourism industry to making protective bootees for their sled dogs. ''The land, the nature, the traditions, the dogs, it is all so close. They share the same roots, and you know that Alaska used to be Russia,'' said Alexei Sitnikov, the owner of the Siberian Fang Kennel and an ecotourism company. An eight-foot, arched whale rib leaning against the front of the kennel came from a northern beach littered with them, he said. The annual Beringia dog sled race was conceived 25 years ago as Russia's answer to the Iditarod, but it has never attracted the same international following. The red tape and cost involved in transporting sled dogs to Kamchatka through Moscow is prohibitive, organizers said, and until last year, first prize was only a Russian off-road vehicle. The race was named after a legendary land mass said to have once linked the region to Alaska, allowing indigenous people to travel freely. Kamchatka's indigenous population currently numbers about 15,000. During the Klondike gold rush in the late 19th century, Siberian dogs were cherished for their strength and resilience, despite their small stature, Mr. Sitnikov said. Now, the most valued dogs come the other way. The Soviet Union turned native villages into collective farms and banned their dogs as backward -- appalled not least that the canines were fed salmon, a hard-to-find delicacy in Moscow. In addition, people here long valued dogs for their skills. ''Once I had a dog who could even catch fish,'' said Mr. Sitnikov, who now breeds dogs for speed, like those from Alaska. More Americans probably know Kamchatka as a territory in Risk, the board game, than as an actual place. Kamchatka's effort to attract more foreigners despite the current Cold War-like chill includes a slick new English guidebook brimming with useful information like how to survive a surprise encounter with a bear. ''Stay calm'' is Point 1. The Beringia starts with a one-day exhibition event held on a groomed racetrack near the capital, because the starting point of the main 590-mile race can be difficult to reach. Few roads cross the northern part of the peninsula, and helicopter charters cost more than $5,000 a day. Kamchatka also produces savage, unpredictable weather. After a particularly snowy February, the city manager was fired for not clearing the streets fast enough. Colossal snow banks lined every road. ''We prefer not to mention and not even to think about the weather,'' quipped Mr. Sitnikov when asked for a forecast. The exhibition event included a children's race. One contestant, Ksenia Kasatkina, 16, is raising four sizable dogs in a three-room apartment and dreams of competing in the Beringia after she turns 18. ''It is a good sport in a place where we have snow for about nine months of the year,'' said her mother, Julya Daoudrich. ''Even when it melts in town, in July we can take the dogs and the sleds to the slopes of the volcano.''"
Kerry to visit Arctic amid concern over ice melt,Norway,"Secretary of State John Kerry will visit the Arctic Circle next week for key ministerial talks on climate change amid global concerns about rising seas and accelerating ice melt. Global warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic than elsewhere on the planet and many fear not only devastating impacts of warming but also from an influx of people and industry on the pristine environment, wildlife and Inuit culture. Kerry will attend a meeting of the Arctic Council in the northwestern Canadian town of Iqaluit, on Baffin Island. The United States on April 24 formally takes over the two-year rotating membership of the intergovernmental forum -- comprising countries with territory within the Arctic -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. The body aims to promote cooperation on environmental protection, as well as to help govern oil and mineral exploitation, shipping, tourism and fishing. America's priorities as the incoming chairman of the body ""include addressing the impacts of climate change, Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship and improving economic and living conditions for people in the Arctic,"" said acting State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. The meeting comes only months before December's UN climate talks in Paris aimed at drawing up a new international pact to peg global warming to 2C over pre-industrial levels. It comes amid further bad news for the Arctic after US officials last month said the Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest winter point since satellite observations began in the late 1970s. Among major carbon emitters, the United States, the European Union and Russia have already put their positions on the table for the Paris talks, with the US vowing a reduction of 26-28 percent in its emissions of greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Rising temperatures have boosted international interest in the polar region, as melting ice opens up shipping routes and makes hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. jkb/pst"
Emerging opportunities in Arctic should be jointly used - Russian diplomat,Norway,"POLITICS: ARCTIC-MEETING-RUSSIA Emerging opportunities in Arctic should be jointly used - Russian diplomat MOSCOW, April 20. /TASS/. The opportunities that are emerging in the Arctic should be used jointly for the benefit of the whole region, Russia’s ambassador-at-large and senior official at the Arctic Council, Vladimir Barbin, said on Monday. ""All the member-states of the Arctic Council believe that the opportunities opening there need to be used collectively and for the good of the whole region,"" the Russian diplomat said ahead of the ministerial meeting on April 24-25 in Iqaluit, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. The Russian delegation will be led by Natural Resources Minister Sergey Donskoy. ""The framework plan that is due to be adopted at the ministerial meeting in the sphere of preventing oil pollution should be aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development in the Arctic,"" Barbin said, adding that the document focuses on the need to avoid environmental risks. Speaking on rivalry in the Arctic amid the current political environment, Barbin said that of course, everyone has an interest here. ""However, all the controversial issues in the Arctic should be resolved through negotiations,"" he said. Russia is ready to cooperate on all the issues, the diplomat said. In particular, this concerns the economic cooperation and raising the investment attractiveness of the region. All the projects that are being initiated by the Arctic Council, including tourism and personnel training, will be implemented and ""the contribution of observer states will be only welcome,"" he said. The Arctic Council is a high-level intergovernmental forum that consists of eight Arctic states - Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States, Finland and Sweden."

Elite few turn the tide on exports,Norway,"Our latest research has revealed the small and medium-sized companies with the fastest growing overseas sales. Richard Tyler reports Britain's economy is growing again, but somecompanies are growing faster than others. The 100 small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) with the fastest-growing international sales have raised their turnover byanaverage of73%a year overtwoyears to £705m, the inaugural Sunday Times BT Business SME Export Track 100 reveals. Even though the typical firm has only £13m in total sales and employs just 80 people, they are operating on a global stage,withtheirexportsgeneratingmore than half their collective sales of £1.3bn. America tops the list of main markets for the companies, with Germany, France and China following close behind. With exporters across the country about to take part in the government's Export Week, the companies in our league table are leading by example. Their growth helped to offset a wider fall in Britain's exports during 2014, when they hit the lowest level since 2010. WeakerdemandfromcontinentalEurope played a significant part in this decline, with total exports to the EU falling by £3bn to £147bn. Business groups such as the CBI say thatthestrengtheningpoundhas alsoput pricing pressure on Britain's manufacturers, but 35 have achieved a place in the table. They include hi-tech firms such as liquid repellent specialist P2i (No89), whose coatings protect shoes and elec-trical devices from rain and spilt coffee, and the No1 company, Cobalt Light Systems. It achieved an average annual rise of 328% in its international sales to £8.1m after exceptional demand for its optical instruments fromairports around the world. The SME Export Track 100 firms come from all over Britain, from Swansea's Dr Organic (No32), the toiletries manufacturer, to tea blender Pukka (No93) in Bristolandbikemaker PlanetX(No69) in Rotherham. More than a quarter have their headquarters in London, including all five of the media firms that feature. The oldest company in the table is Wakefield-based Group Rhodes (No29), whichmakesmetal-forming and material handling machines, and was founded in 1824. Its longevity is the exception rather than the rule. More than half the companies were founded after 2000, including luxury watch brand Christopher Ward (No77), which was set up in 2004 and has customers in more than 90 countries. Seventy of the companies remain majority-owned by their founders, with 13 owned by private equity, nine by families and seven by their managements. Companies have adopted different strategies to increase their international sales. Some have even capitalised on celebrity endorsements. For instance, jeweller Monica Vinader (No23) and maternity clothing designer Séraphine (No79) were both able to cope with the additional customer interest when the Duchess of Cambridge was snapped wearing their goods. Morethanathirdhavesetupaphysical presence in foreign markets, whether thatisasalesoffice,shoporfactory,while a fifth cite their online investment as being a critical factor in their success overseas. Examples include online furniture retailer Amara (No11) and recruitment software firm Madgex (No46). Danny Longbottom from BT Business explores belowthe impact of technology on an SME's ability to trade overseas. As the dust settles after the election andthe directionof travel for the country becomes clear, these 100 companies will provide the inspiration for others as they continue to sell British expertise overseas and create wealth at home. 1 COBALT LIGHT SYSTEMS Optical instrument manufacturer 328.42% Security gates at more than 65 international airports, including Amsterdam's Schiphol and Paris's Charles de Gaulle, rely on Cobalt's machines to scan the contents of our drinks bottles and duty-free shopping to check for explosives. The machines use technology developed in 2004 by Cobalt's chief scientific officer, Pavel Matousek, 52, while he was working at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. Using scientific principles discovered 80 years ago, he designed a laser that could identify the chemical composition of materials in sealed and opaque packages. Matousek's research group formed Cobalt in 2008. In 2009 chief executive Paul Loeffen, 48, was recruited to commercialise the technology. He had previously led x-ray instrument firm Oxford Diffraction, which he founded in 2001 and sold for $48m (£32m) in 2008. Cobalt began selling overseas in 2011, and in addition to airport liquid testing, its machines are used by two-thirds of the world's top 20 pharmaceutical firms to check the chemical composition of rawmaterials and manufactured tablets. Exceptional demand from airports in Europe, Australia and North America propelled international sales to £8.1m in 2014, up an average of 328% a year over the last two years. The commercial success of its science and engineering was recognised when it was named the 2014 winner of the MacRobert Award by the Royal Academy of Engineering. This year the company set up its first international outpost, in Washington, to support growth in North and South America. It has also appointed distributors in China and Japan. Fromthe detection of counterfeit foods to the diagnosis of diseases, Loeffen says the range of potential uses for its technology is huge, and the company has made tentative steps into newarenas, including a recent collaboration with University College London to develop scanning techniques for patients with osteoporosis. 2 ACRO AIRCRAFT SEATING Aircraft seat manufacturer 299.99% KLM, Hawaiian Airlines and Royal Air Maroc use this Crawley firm's seats on their planes.

Croatia's plans to allow oil digging in Adriatic Sea splits the newest EU-member nation,Norway,"MEDULIN, Croatia _ Peter Fries has been coming to Croatia for years after falling in love with its pristine coastline, fresh seafood, mellow wine and friendly hosts. With Croatia announcing it will allow oil drilling in the Adriatic sea, the 60-year-old German businessman is having second thoughts about his loyalty to this Mediterranean tourist haven known for glorious sunsets over sparkling seas and white pebble beaches shadowed by thick pine forests. That picture-perfect image, he fears, could soon change with the construction of giant offshore oil rigs on the horizon. ""This is a high-risk problem,'' Fries said in a warm breeze that stirred the sea's mirrored surface. ""No one wants to swim or dive in a sea with pipelines, oil platforms and tankers.'' Despite surging opposition to pumping crude in the waters of one of Europe's fastest-growing summer travel destinations, the Croatian government is determined to boost the state's poor finances by offering several exploration licenses to foreign energy companies. The decision has deeply split the European Union's newest member state of some 4.3 million, a country still scarred by the 1990s Balkans wars and where the untouched beauty of the Adriatic is a matter of national pride. Opponents warn that besides damaging the spectacular scenery, offshore drilling represents a grave environmental hazard, raising the risk of oil spills that could wreck tourism _ the country's main source of income. Supporters say pumping oil could bring billions of dollars to Croatia's troubled economy, which has been in recession for years. They add that drilling could ultimately help Europe reduce its reliance on Russian energy imports. ""This is an existential matter that will bring a better life to Croatian citizens,'' Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told The Associated Press. The latest opinion polls indicate that 45 per cent of Croats are against Adriatic oil drilling, while 40 per cent are for it _ with those in favour living mostly inland and far from the coast. ""The Adriatic is like a jewel that should not be touched,'' said Ivo Lorencin whose main income is renting rooms in a quiet bay in the northern Adriatic during the three-month summer peak season. ""If the sea is destroyed, we all are destroyed.'' Croatia's Adriatic tourism industry was already devastated once _ during the war for independence from former Yugoslavia. The stunning medieval walled town of Dubrovnik was severely damaged by shelling, and broadcasts of warfare beamed around the world kept tourists away years after the conflict subsided. Tourist numbers of about 11 million a year returned to pre-war levels in 2012, only after widespread rebuilding and a worldwide media campaign under the slogan: ""The Mediterranean as it once was.'' The government believes that Croatia's strategic position between Europe's east and west could turn the country into a regional energy powerhouse, like Norway in the North Sea. ""Croatia will then become an energy exporter which will bring security of supplies to the region,'' Vrdoljak said. He said that environmental risks would be minimal because the latest EU safety standards would be applied, and most of the new offshore platforms would not be visible from the main coast. ""All studies say that the (oil) production is a lesser environmental risk than transportation by tankers that we now use to import oil,'' he said, adding that there was no need for a popular referendum demanded by the opposition, and hinted at by the country's prime minister. The initial exploration, which will determine the quantities and profitability of oil production in the Adriatic, is set to start in June and last for five years before commercial pumping eventually begins. There is little doubt that there are oil and gas reserves in the area. In neighbouring Italy, dozens of offshore platforms currently operate, some syphoning crude. There are also 18 rigs on the Croatian side of the Adriatic that extract only gas, which is considered a much smaller environmental risk than oil. Croatia's Greens are unimpressed by government's safety pledges. They have started a petition campaign entitled ""Say NO to oil in the Adriatic, say YES to sustainable growth.'' ""The risks are very high,'' said Mirela Holy, the leader of ORaH, a small Green party that started the campaign. ""Alternatives are renewable energies, especially in the Adriatic, such as solar energy, windmills and small hydro power stations.'' Opponents also say that Croatia's tourist revenue of about 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) a year far exceeds the potential financial benefits of oil exploration, estimated by the government at euros 160 million ($180 million) a year in licenses given to oil companies. ""In case of an accident, this (tourist revenue) will be completely destroyed,'' said Monica Frassoni, co-chair of the European Green Party, attending an environmental conference in Croatia's capital, Zagreb. ""So, why the risk?''"
£16bn to spend - how hard can it be?,Norway,"Meet the man who has billions of Norway’s oil cash to invest in central London property January 13, 2011, started inauspiciously for Karsten Kallevig. The head of property at Norway’s sovereign wealth fund woke up at a hotel in London’s West End ready to sign a £450m deal to buy 25% of Regent Street from the Crown Estate. “I put on the TV, then just read through the contract one last time,” he said. “And on the TV they’re showing there’s a guy who has locked himself in a store on Regent Street, saying he’s got a bomb. I’m sitting there, saying on one hand ‘I’m very glad this came before I signed’. On the other hand, ‘any day he had to pick to lock himself into a store and threaten to blow himself up, it’s today’.” Police soon escorted away the would-be bomber and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) bought the stake. Standing on Regent Street last week, floppy fringe blowing in the wind, Kallevig pointed out how the shopping hub has changed since then. The last few tartan-and-tat tourist shops have gone and flagship stores from retailers such as Coach, J.Crew and Watches of Switzerland have opened. “I must say, I wish we had come into Regent Street way, way before, because I’m sure you remember it from the early 1990s and it looked different, right?” he said. “The Crown Estate, which retains majority ownership and manages the street, has been very, very good at turning it into something unique. And you ask yourself, how can they have done that? Look at Oxford Street. It’s a great street as well, it’s always been a great shopping street, but there’s a very different feel.” Kallevig, 40, speaks with a mixed American and Norwegian accent, the result of a secondary education in Oslo and a career in high finance. He has a cerebral edge, citing The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck as his favourite book and Lost in Translation as his favourite film. Having studied at MIT in Boston, worked briefly at Goldman Sachs and Soros Real Estate, and spent 11 years at the private equity firm Grove International Partners, Kallevig was recruited to oversee NBIM’s push into property in 2010. Norway’s use of its oil riches contrasts with that of Britain. Whereas successive governments here splashed most of the 1980s and 1990s North Sea production boom on tax cuts and public spending, Norway established a sovereign wealth fund in 1990. NBIM received its first wave of cash six years later. Today, the fund holds 6,971bn krone (£573bn) — £115,000 for every person in Norway. About 4% a year is siphoned off to subsidise government spending. The rest is invested in equities, bonds and property. NBIM has become one of the biggest investors in the London stock market, alongside the American fund manager BlackRock. Kalle–vig’s mandate is to crank up the property weighting from 2.3% to 5% in the next few years. That doesn’t seem a big shift, but it means ploughing £16bn more into bricks and mortar in a manageable way. “He has one of the biggest challenges in the industry,” said a senior investment banker. “It sounds like Brewster’s Millions [a film in which a minor league baseball player has to spend $30m in 30 days to win an even bigger inheritance] but it’s not as easy as that.” NBIM wanted a global property portfolio — but, as Kallevig pointed out, “you can’t be everywhere”. “Real estate is a lot of work,” he said, “and when you’re in the unlisted business, nothing’s standardised, nothing’s really liquid, nothing’s transparent, and all of that, so you have to do the work.” His team decided to “mimic” a global portfolio by picking 10 cities with strong economies, growing populations and restricted supply. In London, Regent Street was followed by the purchase of 58% of the Pollen Estate in Mayfair. As time has passed, NBIM has paid relatively higher prices and accepted lower yields. Kallevig seems unconcerned: “I remember in London in 1999, [people were] saying it’s crazy, prices are insane, residential prices clearly can’t go higher . . . And what has happened to residential prices since 1999?” He said there had been “exactly the same conversation” when NBIM bought into Regent Street. “People were telling me, look, you paid way too much for this . . . you’re going to struggle. And they [prices] certainly have increased by a lot more than we expected when we acquired our stake, meaning that, on paper, that’s been a very good investment.” Kallevig acknowledged that London looked expensive on measures such as price per square foot and short-term yields. “There are other cities that are cheaper,” he said. “Now, you can use different metrics. You can say, let me compare the yield on the best properties and compare them to real [interest] rates . . . If you did that — and I’m not saying that’s the way I’m looking at it — then suddenly London probably becomes one of the cheapest cities.” Calling the cycle is a routine occupation for property veterans. Last month, the former Land Securities boss Mike Hussey said Britain was five years into a “phenomenal” 15-year property boom and that London would not see a cyclical downturn for a generation. William Newsom of the estate agent Savills said the market was going through “extraordinary times”, driven by low interest rates and quantitative easing, but it was a “long way” from seeing a return of “silly” lending. In contrast, Mike Prew, an analyst at the investment bank Jefferies, said: “The party isn’t over yet but the slow music is definitely playing.” Kallevig said he was “always surprised” by the industry greats’ perceived ability to predict the future. “We have an allocation that is 5% of the whole fund. That’s a very big number. And there’s no way we can put that amount of capital into real estate and try to time the market and say, now we’re going to get out of London, it’s getting too expensive, let’s sell everything and then in a couple of years we’re going to buy everything and ride the cycle.” Aside from buying 50% of Meadowhall shopping centre near Sheffield, NBIM is focused on just a few square miles of Britain — the area of the capital bordered by Hyde Park to the west, King’s Cross to the north, St Paul’s to the east and the Thames to the south. Would London have lost its sheen under a Labour government, whose proposed policies included a mansion tax? “Er, we usually don’t make investment decisions depending on the current government,” said Kallevig. “Back in 1998 and 1999, there was a real discussion of whether Frankfurt or London would be the new kind of capital leader . . . whether banks should be moving headquarters because Frankfurt could be the new capital of Europe. I don’t think that happened.” He is similarly unmoved by the prospect of an in-out vote on EU membership. “Again, very hard to predict the future. I like London as a city as I used to live here, but the fact that it’s such an international city, it attracts people . . . All of that becomes this self-fulfilling prophecy that just has taken on a life of its own.”"
The eurozone was a dream of unity. Now Europe has turned upon itself,Norway,"Joining the euro club was once a badge of political and economic advancement. Now, if Athens is pushed out, others may choose to follow Finally, the endgame. After weeks of posturing, Greece is running out of time to escape bankruptcy and a forced exit from the European single currency. By Friday, as both sides scrambled to fix up a fresh round of talks for this weekend after the International Monetary Fund’s negotiators flew home in frustration, it appeared that European officials had been discussing how they might manage a Greek default. It’s hard not to be mesmerised by the day-to-day drama of walkouts, public posturing and political intrigue, which may finally reach its conclusion in the coming days. But as Greece hurtles towards the brink, it’s worth asking how we got here. The euro was always meant to be a political project above all – lifting Europe’s stragglers up to the living standards of the rest and, in doing so,k cementing the political ties between Athens and Antwerp, Madrid and Munich. Joining the club was a badge of political sophistication, as well as economic advancement; and clubbing together, it was thought, would help the European economy to act as a counterweight to the might of the dollar and the hegemony of US-style market capitalism. It’s a measure of how far the eurozone has departed from that founding mythology that the IMF, the fountainhead of economic neoliberalism, has sometimes found itself having to act as a moderating force as the bailout talks have dragged on in recent weeks. Greece has contracted by an extraordinary 20% at the behest, and under the supervision, of its eurozone partners It appears to have been the IMF that has insisted on putting the possibility of debt write-offs on the table, for example, when European negotiators were unwilling to countenance it. Since 2010, Europe’s powerful “core” countries – led by Germany – have forced Greece and the other bailed-out countries to swallow a hefty dose of neoliberal orthodoxy: deep spending cuts, deregulation of a string of markets, pension reforms, the dismantling of collective bargaining. Private sector bondholders, many of them German banks who lent hand over fist to Greece in the runup to the crisis, were largely made good; workers have suffered wage cuts as the government struggles to make repayments to its bailout creditors. And all the while, Greece’s plight has continued to worsen. Since the first “rescue” was agreed in May 2010, the Greek economy has contracted by an extraordinary 20% – an economic collapse on a scale unthinkable in an advanced economy since the days of the Great Depression – at the behest, and under the supervision, of its eurozone partners. Meanwhile, unemployment has more than doubled, rising from 12% to 26%. As default looms, a fair observer must admit that neither side in the slow-motion car crash has acquitted itself well. Alexis Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, have spent too much time grandstanding and writing spiky op-eds in the international press (or chatting to Vladimir Putin) when they should have been engaged in the hard graft of technical negotiations. Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, has sometimes seemed more interested in impugning the trustworthiness of his Greek interlocutors than trying to find common ground and cement a deal. It would be quite understandable – though deeply risky – if Athens decides that enough is enough: without some element of debt forgiveness it will be hard to see any deal as financially sustainable, and its “red lines” on politically toxic pension reform appear to be under threat. The sharp devaluation that would follow if the country readopted the drachma would at least give trade and tourism a boost. But even if Greece is snatched from the brink of bankruptcy and kept in the euro in the coming days, the cause of promoting solidarity between eurozone nations has been long forgotten. It would hardly be surprising if the citizens of Greece – and, over time, perhaps those of other hard-pressed eurozone economies – decided they’d rather take their chances in the tough world of global markets alone. ‘Irresponsibility’ is too mild a term: traders did $3tn of damage The rigging of Libor, we now know, took place with alacrity across the City. “I’m like a whore’s drawers,” one trader quipped as he moved interest rates up and down as favours for friends. There were offers of lunch, curries and bottles of champagne for playing along. The same goes for foreign exchange. Traders at various banks discuss trading patterns in chatrooms, calling themselves “the players”, “the 3 musketeers”, “1 team, 1 dream”, and “the A-team”. As Bank of England governor Mark Carney put it last week: “Unethical behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions.” His answer is to put these fixed income, currency and commodities markets – Ficc, as they are known in the Square Mile – under much closer scrutiny. Informal codes of practice that were ignored are to be replaced with far tougher procedures. Tens of thousands of fund managers, traders and interdealer brokers will be brought within the ambit of a new Senior Managers’ Regime, which comes into force next March and make individuals responsible for their actions. A new market standards board will be created to police new, tougher codes of conduct. Criminal offences should be extended to rigging and abusing these Ficc markets (not just stock markets) and jail terms extended from seven to 10 years. But will the prospect of more time behind bars act as a deterrent? Not if convictions remain as rare as they are currently. But Carney spelled out succinctly why the “age of irresponsibility” has to end. He rattled off statistics showing that fines of around $150bn have been imposed on major banks in the seven years since the banking crisis. These fines had resulted in the global economy being deprived of $3tn of potential growth-boosting credit. That is something that the Libor riggers and forex manipulators cannot joke about. Scots are right to wonder where the oil money went The Office for Budget Responsibility dealt a blow to the Scottish National party’s desire for full fiscal autonomy last week. By warning that North Sea oil and gas fields could generate total tax revenues of just £2bn between 2020 and 2041, it sent a signal that Scotland would struggle to go it alone as an independent nation. The economic consequences of these estimates are clear, but observers should beware of making assumptions about the political ones. Voters in Scotland, and the rest of the UK, have every right to ask what has happened to all the money made from the North Sea. Unlike in Norway, there is no oil-backed sovereign wealth fund to pay for infrastructure and rainy days. It has all gone. Supporters of independence might see this mismanagement of a national resource as further evidence for giving Scotland control of its own economic affairs."
"Campaigns to divest from fossil-fuel holdings gain steam; While becoming ""fossil free"" is increasingly popular, opinions are split on the effectiveness of these efforts",Norway,"From Canadian campuses and churches to American foundations and Norway’s parliament, a debate is raging over whether to divest out of fossil-fuel investments. Thirty campuses in Canada have divestment campaigns to move out of fossil-fuel holdings. No university has announced plans to divest, and some, such as the University of Calgary, have ruled that option out. But change is afoot: Concordia University is creating a $5-million fossil-free fund, while faculty and students at the University of British Columbia and University of Victoria have voted in favour of divesting. Several churches have divested. And one Toronto-based foundation this year took its investments out of oil sands and coal and is putting them into renewable energy – including one initiative that converts zoo manure into biogas. Global efforts are gaining momentum. Last year, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund pulled out of fossil-fuel investments, and so did the World Council of Churches. Last month, Oxford University pledged to avoid investments in coal and oil sands firms. This month, Norway’s parliament voted to shed coal-related investments from its $890-billion sovereign-wealth fund, which is the world’s largest. And just last week in Australia, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians said it is divesting from fossil fuels “due to health impacts of climate change.” Stanford University has gotten out of coal and so has French insurer Axa SA. Some draw parallels to a generation ago, when the anti-apartheid movement swelled in campuses, churches and community groups, backing a boycott, divestments and sanctions against the South African regime. (This comparison, too, is subject of debate as the methods and issues differ.) And opinions are split on the effectiveness of these divestment campaigns and the degree to which they’ll actually impact climate change. For Desmond Wilson, director of finance at the $40-million Catherine Donnelly Foundation, the decision to divest in February – just as oil prices were plummeting – wasn’t taken lightly and made only after months of researching financial risks, to better understand carbon bubbles, stranded assets and opportunities in clean energy. “For us as a foundation, deciding to divest is a big deal because our practice in managing our investments – we like to think of ourselves as a socially responsible investor – is to stress the engagement approach. So to divest is a very unique thing to do and not typical at all,” said Mr. Wilson. “But we felt this issue was so important, that this was one way to stimulate a discussion around the important issue of climate change.” It was also an opportunity to re-direct some funds into areas they want to support such as alternative energy, among them solar energy and ZooShare, a co-operative that converts zoo waste and food waste into biogas. “If we’re going to be serious about climate change, we’re going to have to give the supports and encouragement that’s going to see us evolve to a low-carbon economy.” On campuses, Kelsey Mech, a co-ordinator at Fossil Free Canada, estimates this past spring saw more than ten thousand students come out in favour of divestment. The goal of the divestment campaigns is to ultimately spur a shift “to a clean and just energy future,” she said. “When large institutions like universities choose to divest from fossil fuels, it sends a clear message that these industries no longer have the social licence they require to operate.” Within university departments though, views are mixed. At the University of British Columbia’s economics department, two well-regarded professors stand in opposition: Kevin Milligan is not in favour of the divestment campaign; his colleague, David Green, is. “I really question whether this does anything,” said Prof. Milligan. One reason is that if a group of people move out of an asset, all it takes is one deep-pocketed investor to swoop in, taking advantage of a dip in the share price to buy up the stock. So the financial hit to the company is small. (He said divesting is very different from the South African boycott, where groups of, say, tourists refusing to travel really did ramp up the economic pressure.) Another factor, he says, is that making decisions about a fund that is collectively held leads to a moral quagmire – if oil is deemed immoral by some, then what about cars (or cigarettes or dairy) for others? He also questions why pressure is aimed at producers rather than consumers, who continue to drive demand for oil. “If there were not consumers, no one would be digging the oil out of the ground. The only reason it has value is because people want to buy stuff. So I don’t see why all the moral culpability is on the producers side.” He thinks local efforts, such as his university’s move to use more geothermal energy, along with individual decisions on investing, are more effective. In the other camp, Prof. Green says it’s important to “establish the social norm that we are moving to a carbon-free society.” He figures the role of a university is to look for ways to change those norms. “If we don’t ask the big questions about what is really driving our problems and how to get society to change, who will?” UBC’s funds currently have about $100-million invested in fossil-fuel-related firms of its total endowment of about $1.3-billion. The board’s committee will make a recommendation on the divestment proposal this fall. There are other thorny issues. Some energy companies are also growing players in renewable energy. And while becoming “fossil free” is increasingly popular, it is an ambiguous definition, which in some cases still includes large emitters, said Alan Harman, portfolio manager at ScotiaMcLeod who manages socially responsible and fossil-free funds. He is concerned that the focus on divesting may be overshadowing other SRI criteria, such as governance or human rights. More than $50-billion has so far been divested globally, an amount that is climbing, but is still a fraction of the total market cap in the sector, at $4.5-trillion. Another question centres on performance – whether moving out of these investments carries a financial penalty. In fact, an RBC review of the literature shows “socially responsible investing does not result in lower investment returns,” while the FTSE Developed index excluding fossil fuels has outperformed the main developed index in four of the past five years. And analysis by Morgan Stanley has found sustainable equity funds “met or exceeded median returns” for five of the six different equity classes it examined. Concordia University’s foundation, in what appears to be a first among universities in Canada, is creating a new sustainable fund, which will screen out fossil fuels and tobacco. The $5-million fund (of a total $130-million endowment) will start this fall, with scope for it to be expanded over time. “We’re not divesting. We are creating a sustainable investment fund,” said spokeswoman Chris Mota. One motivation, she says, was from students. “It was brewing. You could see it on university campuses. And it was going to come to our campus sooner rather than later.” The discussion has spilled into the United Church of Canada, which has received proposals from congregations to divest out of fossil fuels – some of them from Alberta. The church has about $2-million of its $130-million in these types of holdings and the matter will be voted on in August, said chief financial officer Erik Mathiesen. Some churches in Toronto and Ottawa have already divested. Across the pond, Cambridge University has struck a working group that will take 10 months to investigate what the endowment should be doing on climate change, exploring options from energy efficiency financing to whether to divest from coal and oil sands holdings, said Ellen Quigley, who is part of the working group. One key spur to re-thinking investment strategies landed last week, when G7 leaders including Stephen Harper pledged to phase out fossil fuels by 2100. The G7 announcement means this “certainly is not something that’s avoidable as a discussion any more. Over the longer term, you’re going to have to make a transition at some point, and the question for investors is when, not if,” said Martin Grosskopf, who runs an AGF global sustainable-growth equity fund that doesn’t have fossil-fuel-related firms. While the actual divestment dollars may still seem small, the players moving out are influential, he noted. “With Rockefeller, that’s not a big amount of money. But the impact they had just in terms of lending their name to this issue has been huge. … Sometimes big changes happen with small ripples.” Support for the divestment movement has also sprung from a surprising quarter: Shell’s former chairman Mark Moody-Stuart said this month divestment is a “rational” and that it is “distressing” that industry has not made much progress in addressing the threat of climate change. For Mr. Wilson, at the Toronto foundation, the motivation was both moral and financial. “We see a financial risk in holding these stocks” due to a growing likelihood that some reserves will have to stay in the ground, he said. And though its normal approach is to hold a stock and try to influence corporate behaviour, in this case, “if the business-as-usual model is not challenged, it’s unsustainable. … This seems to be an issue that’s on a different scale.” What’s the word Divestment: The selling of an asset, subsidiary or investment. Divestment is an especially appropriate term when the sale is being made by a corporation because of social goals or a change in corporate strategy. Globe and Mail Update"
Norway's Shift From Oil Stirs Trouble in Fiords,Norway,"VEVRING, Norway--When the government this spring approved a project to mine a pricey pigment from a nearby hill, saying it would create jobs and help diversify the economy, Ingvar Osland immediately saw a darker flip side. After sifting out the valuable whitener, known as rutile, the mine operator would discard millions of tons of waste into a pristine fiord. Scientists at the government-funded Institute of Marine Research warned of ""pollution on a massive scale."" Fish farmers such as Mr. Osland fear the environmental harm could tarnish the reputation of Norwegian salmon. ""We'll have to move,"" he says. ""If the fiord is known for waste and chemicals, we risk losing customers, even if we can document that the quality is good."" Nordic Mining ASA, which is behind the $300 million project, says any environmental impact would be temporary. The government noted that the Norwegian Environment Agency backed the plan, adding that constant monitoring of marine life would help prevent any damage. ""I am very confident that the decision we have made, with very tough requirements, is based on a correct assessment,"" Minister of Trade and Industry Monica Maeland said in an interview. The battle over the rutile pit in Vevring highlights how Norway--despite sitting on the world's biggest wealth fund, with nearly $900 billion in assets--is straining to refashion an economy heavily reliant on oil-and-gas exports. Norway is on a quest to diversify because the sharp drop in crude-oil prices is denting export revenue and, in any case, it anticipates a long-term reduction in oil-related businesses. But four decades of oil bounty have pushed average wages in Norway close to world-record highs--nearly 50% above EU levels--making it difficult for other industries to flourish. Many oil-rich countries are tapping into export revenue in a bid to foster new businesses at home. But the Norwegian government says investing too much government money at home would fuel inflation. It has taken a different approach: plowing the bulk of its oil royalties overseas while trying to create a favorable business climate for private investors. With the sharp rise in some mineral prices--including that of rutile, used to whiten everything from paints to paper and sun cream--mining has emerged as a viable business option in Norway. In Vevring, a town of 300 people, that could mean about 170 jobs and work for half a century, Nordic Mining says. The project first ignited local protests, with fish farmers warning it will harm seafood production, the country's second source of export revenue after oil. It has now become part of a wider, national debate about how Norwegians will keep themselves busy in the future, as many worry that adding mining to oil will leave the country locked in unsustainable industries. ""Yes, Norway needs to create new jobs. But not this kind of jobs,"" Bård Vegar Solhjell, a member of the Socialist Left Party and Norway's former environment minister, said. ""We should not sacrifice the environment and our clean fiords to create jobs."" The rutile deposit was first identified when a road tunnel was drilled in the 1970s, around the same time Norway made major oil discoveries in the North Sea. The hills near Vevring remained untouched as the oil industry sucked in labor and investment. DuPont, the U.S. chemical giant, considered starting the mine in the 1990s but quickly pulled out. People involved in the project at the time cited changes in corporate strategy and concerns about profitability. A company official this month said he was unable to comment because it was too long ago. When Nordic Mining bought rights to the deposit in 2007, the Vevring fish farmers were enthusiastic at first because of the possible new jobs. But the project was delayed by prolonged technical reviews and because of staunch opposition from the Socialist Left Party, then part of a coalition government. That changed in 2013, when right-wing Prime Minister Erna Solberg took the helm, and the Socialists were pushed out of government. The new cabinet approved the rutile plan in April and has also expressed support for a copper mining project in northern Norway. ""We need to strengthen other industries,"" Ms. Maeland, the trade minister, said. Some people in Vevring, like 21-year-old student Ragnhild Underlid, have rallied against Nordic Mining and the government from the start. ""The Foerde fiord is like a part of our family silverware,"" she said during a May 1 protest at the inner end of the fiord. ""We can't risk our most cherished treasure for short-term profit."" Opposition grew as Nordic Mining released more details about how it would discard fine-crushed rock mixed with chemicals into the fiord, with tourist and seafood industry groups, environmental organizations and some politicians joining. On May 26, nearly 1,000 people protested outside Parliament in Oslo. The Institute of Marine Research, one of several agencies and lobby groups that responded to requests for comment, opposed the idea of dumping mining waste in the fiord, said Jan Helge Fossaa, a scientist at the institute. ""We advised against the disposal plan, but of course the government has the final say,"" Mr. Fossaa said. The Norwegian Environment Agency gave the project its backing in February after some initial skepticism, leading some opposition parties to accuse the government of having applied political pressure. The Minister of Climate and Environment dismissed the accusations. Nordic Mining says it understands the skepticism about the dumping, but said Norway has a lot of experience from similar projects. At the Vevring fish farm, Mr. Osland says he isn't looking forward to Nordic Mining moving in. ""I don't think we can be friends,"" he says.

SCANDINAVIA WITHOUT THE WHOPPING BILLS,Norway,"Everyone warns you about how expensive Scandinavia is, but you dont really believe it until youve ordered two small beers in Oslo, done the sums twice and realised youve paid £16. Or until youve snuck a mouldy cheese quiche out of your rucksack in a restaurant because the only thing you can afford on the menu is a starter. My wife Ali and I were fortunate that, when we took five weeks off work to drive around Norway and Sweden, we were able to reduce the cost of our trip in other ways. One of the best things about the Nordic countries "" apart from the scenery, the people, the food, the low crime rate and the widespread use of English "" is the concept of Allemannsretten (everymans rights). Unlike in England, you are allowed to camp almost anywhere, as long as you dont make a nuisance of yourselves. Our 36-year-old campervan was no longer a slow, rusty and unreliable alternative to a Ford Focus. It was a slow, rusty and unreliable kitchen, bedroom and dual aspect sitting room. If we drove past a Norwegian fjord we liked, we had only to pull over and set up a free hotel for the night. The fjords provided mussels and opportunities to wash. Gin we sensibly brought with us from home. Of course, it didnt always go to plan. One of our most beautiful spots turned out to be occupied by territorial seagulls, who showed their displeasure by dive-bombing us all night. Another low point came two weeks into the trip when we ran out of clothes. We found a public washing machine, but not a dryer and so, as the Norwegian heavens opened, we sat in the van surrounded by 20lb of wet clothes. They remained wet for another 48 hours, whereupon we admitted defeat and used all the money wed saved on gin to book a hotel. The lows never lasted long, however. All the cliches about Scandinavia "" the playground of the giants, the land of the midnight sun "" are true. Where else could you start an eight-hour walk at three in the afternoon? Or canoe for four days without seeing another soul? Perhaps most of all, we were just grateful not to be trapped in Denmark. Within ten minutes of arriving in Esbjerg by ferry on our first day, the rear axle broke. And so our first night was spent wild camping on a bustling street, avoiding drunk Scottish oil workers, and waiting for a garage to open the next day. After that experience, every mile of the 3,000 we covered "" from the glaciers of Jostedal to the beaches of southern Sweden, from touristy Bergen to beautiful Stockholm "" was a blessing. And although coming home has been painful, it is at least some small consolation that the vans next MOT should cost only three-and-a-half Norwegian pints. lFor further information on Norway go to visitnorway.com and for Sweden visitsweden.com."
Norwegian Banks Refill ATMs as Greece-Bound Tourists Demand Euros,Norway,"Norwegian banks were busy refilling cash machines with euros and advising travellers to Greece to stock up on euros Monday. Steps by Athens to shut down its banking system until July 7 and impose capital controls to keep money in the country have triggered a rush for euro cash among the many Scandinavian tourists heading to the country's popular island getaways. The airport in Stavanger, home to Norwegian oil giant Statoil ASA, ran out of euros early Sunday morning after hundreds en route to Greece withdrew significantly larger amounts of the common single currency than usual, said Thor-Christian Haugland, spokesman for SpareBank SR-Bank, which runs the ATMs at the country's fourth-biggest airport. ""We've been completely taken aback by the Greek effect,"" Mr. Haugland said. ""Many travelers are worried and are hoarding cash."" Truckloads of euros are now scurrying to airports across the country of 5 million people to help travelers to Greece fill up their pockets with euros, banks said. Even Westerveld, a spokesman for DNB ASA, Norway's largest bank, said it was advising customers to take enough euros in cash to cover their entire stay in Greece, amid fears hotels, restaurants and shops may stop accepting credit cards and the country's cash machines could run out of money. He said the bank had sent an extra delivery of euros to Oslo's main airport Gardermoen Monday but added travelers may be wise to withdraw cash before heading to the airport. Mr. Haugland at SR-Bank advised travelers to pay for hotels, transport and excursions in advance if possible since traveling with large amounts of cash also poses a risk. So far, they said there were no reports of tourists cancelling their vacations to Greece as a result of the crisis, although some were calling to look into the finer details of their travel insurance. -Write to Anna Molin at anna.molin@wsj.com; Twitter: @AnnaWSJ (END) Dow Jones Newswires June 29, 2015 07:55 ET (11:55 GMT)"
Massive cost overruns at Corrib plant led to multimillion tax losses for State; Objections to the Corrib Gas project contributed to a €2.4bn cost overrun and a €600m loss of tax revenue,Norway,"The huge cost overrun on Corrib Gas, the single most expensive energy infrastructure project in Ireland and the largest since the Ardnacrusha hydroelectric scheme on the Shannon in the 1920s, will deprive the Government of an estimated €600 million in tax revenue. The €600 million represents 25 per cent of the project's likely cost overrun of €2.4 billion, much of which was incurred because of changes made to the project since it began. Had this additional €2.4 billion not been spent on development costs, an extra €600 million would have been paid to the exchequer as tax on profit, which for exploration companies is levied at 25 per cent. However, like all companies, Shell Exploration and Production Ireland, which is a partner with Statoil of Norway and Vermilion Energy of Canada, can write off capital development costs against taxation. Separate to the €600 million lost tax, it has also cost the State more than €20 million up to June 2014 to police the protests against the project - €16.4 million on Garda overtime and €3.9 million on normal payroll costs. The €2.4 billion cost overrun is largely as a consequence of opposition to the project, which was stimulated in part by poor management of it at its outset. Poor handling of the project In candid remarks to a Business in the Community conference, and also in an interview with The Irish Times, shortly before his departure earlier this year to a new position within Shell, the company's managing director for Ireland from 2012, Michael Crothers, acknowledged the company's poor handling of the project. ""We underestimated the level of community concern and unrest,"" Crothers said in the interview. ""Inadequate engagement led to decisions that, in hindsight, were too legalistic in approach rather than really understanding what the concerns were, and in spending some extra time working those through. ""What we ended up doing to rebuild relations and trust was what we should have done in the first place - that was having local community people engaged as liaisons, working at the very start of the project to understand what the concerns were, rather than be driven by a project schedule, which is what essentially happened."" Crothers said that while Shell had permits to bring the gas on shore and build a terminal, ""We didn't have what we might have called social licence"". The company focused too much on ""legality and not [enough on] legitimacy"". The company had learned lessons from this, he said, and now focused as much on what he called ""social seismic"" as on actual seismic surveying to find oil and gas. But he felt Ireland too had lessons to learn from the Corrib project if the sort of conflicts and chronic delays that attended it were to be avoided in the future. ""In other countries that I've been to,"" he said, ""there's a process where there's a mediation required, rather than going to court. You are required to come together and sit with the planning body, or the regulator, table your concerns and actually come up with solutions in a mediated process. It's actually time bound and it's a public process."" Crothers's comments about the planning and development process are echoed by Peter Cassells, former general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Cassells now works at the Edward M Kennedy Institute in Maynooth University, where he specialises in conflict resolution. In 2005 he was appointed an independent mediator after the jailing of the Rossport Five, the protesters jailed for contempt of court. Community gain His report, in June 2006, suggested altering the pipeline route away from Rossport and highlighted the need for ""community gain"" in large infrastructure projects. Stemming from that, Shell set up three channels through which funds were given to the community. They were a local grants programme, a third-level scholarships programme and the Erris Development Fund and they have been administered by an independent board comprised of local people. Under the latter, Mayo County Council and the company, at the request of villagers, put in lighting and footpaths in Pullathomas. Development fund support has gone to Erris Tourism, a local initiative; to projects such as river angling enhancement schemes, in partnership with Inland Fisheries Ireland; and to parish outreach groups. More than 80 school-leavers have received annual third-level grants. Many local young people also benefited from paid internships by working for Shell during their holidays. Critics To date, more than €13.5 million has been disbursed by the company into the community. To critics of the project, these grants represent, in effect, community bribes. To recipients, however, they represent a windfall which critics, and a protest- focused media, have not acknowledged. Thirty-one-year-old Reynagh Keane from Erris, a DIT graduate in environmental health, worked on several internships and is now employed full-time by Shell as an operations technician trainee, one of the 175 jobs which Shell says will be in Erris for the life of the Corrib gas field, estimated at 20 years. Keane has just got engaged and what her job means to her, she says, is security. ""I can settle down now and build [a house],"" she says. Bridie Conway, a former housing officer with Sligo County Council and expert in development funding for disadvantaged areas who is community liaison officer with Shell since 2009, says the rule of thumb for her team was to ensure ""maximum benefits to the community and at the same time minimise the construction impacts of the project on local residents"". In an interview for this series, Cassells said a lesson from the Corrib saga should be the need to avoid another protracted row through, at least in part, a system of compulsory mediation. ""Mediation, on a statutory basis, needs to be built into the [planning and development] process early on. For example, it is built in at the moment in the commercial courts,"" he said. Complaints about intimidation Cassells spent months in Erris in 2005 and 2006 listening to local concerns after the jailing of the Rossport Five. He said there were ""many complaints about intimidation"" by opponents but he estimated that 60 to 70 per cent of the people supported the project, even at the height of the protests. Of the remainder, he said he believes many simply had concerns and were not necessarily outright opponents. However, the system had no way of accommodating them. ""When you walk into the room for any planning hearing, including in the case of Corrib, you have the signs which told you the applicant, objectors and then the technical people. So if I wanted to go in and express some concerns, I actually had to sit with the objectors. So immediately the whole thing is set up in that particular way."" Mediation It should be part of any large-scale infrastructure project - EirGrid or a wind farm, for instance - that mediation was part of the pre-planning stage. ""Developers, who can get pre-planning advice from local authority officials, should be made also to talk to local communities,"" he said. ""It should also be part of pre-planning that those who wish to do something have to consider what is the community gain from their project. Sponsoring a few things is fine but development will also have a serious impact on an area, some of it good, some not so good. So there needs to be consideration given to how does this proposal fit into the overall plan for the area?"" As he left Erris, Crothers reflected on what lessons might be learned from the Corrib saga. ""Speaking from experience,"" he said, ""getting it right up front beats trying to recover later."" Getting it right may be elusive, however. Cassells commented: ""The one thing that certainly struck me in terms of Corrib is . . . there doesn't seem to be any way in which we're trying to either capture, or learn, the lessons of what happened.""

Russian press review,Norway,"PRESS-REVIEW Russian press review /TASS World Service/ MOSCOW, July 13. /TASS/. REAL ESTATE OWNERS WILL NOT DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR ASSETS The Federal Security Service (FSB) has proposed to close access to information about real estate owners that is stored in the Unified state register of real estate ownership rights and transactions, according to the draft law published on the official portal. The explanatory note to the draft law says that limiting access of third parties to information about real estate owners is meant to prevent using such data ""for criminal or compromising purposes."" According to RBC daily, data from Register is now available to everyone and can be disclosed on request of any persons. The proposed amendments limit the number of persons who have the right to request information about real estate owners to the owners themselves or their representatives, those whose property is on bail and state authorities. Other people can obtain information only on owner’s official authorization. ""Such information can be compromising only in case of illegal real estate ownership or failure to declare property. This is to the benefit of officials who do not want to state their real income. It is the very opposite to fighting corruption,"" RBC quoted Alexey Kashirsky from Moscow Collegium of Lawyers ""Defense"" as saying. Open real estate ownership is one of main indicators of healthy real estate market, the Vedomosti daily quoted law firm ""Yust"" partner Alexander Bolomatov as saying. Existing architecture of defending someone’s rights in civil proceedings is based on the openness of the Register. Thus, the draft law may change the system of court defense, while limiting access to information my lead to growing corruption on the real estate market. X X X RUSSIA WILL HELP GREECE WITH OIL PRODUCTS - VEDOMOSTI Russia has decided to support Greece and is eyeing the possibility of directly supplying fuel to the country, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. The Energy Ministry plans to reach a corresponding agreement in a few weeks. According to Novak, Russia considers supplying oil products. If needed, gasoline, diesel fuel and other products will be exported in the necessary amount, he noted. ""It is wrong to think that Moscow plans to open some kind of channel of aid to Greece, but, proceeding from our good relations, we are ready to make some steps to support its struggling economy,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Greece will be interested in such a deal only in one case - if it is offered significant discounts, Vygon Consulting chief economist Sergey Ezhov said. This means someone has to pay - either companies (by lowering prices) or the budget (by lowering tariffs). Both these options are very questionable, the expert noted. Peskov did not specify conditions of the possible deal, but stressed that one thing is buying products on the market, and another thing are direct supplies, as the price can be more attractive in the second case. X X X UGANDA PLANS TO BUY $740 MILLION WORTH OF RUSSIAN ARMS - VEDOMOSTI Uganda’s newspaper New Vision reported that the government of this African country has requested parliamentary approval for taking a $740 million loan to purchase Russian military equipment. According to a source in the Russian defense industry, Uganda wants to buy T-72B tanks from the Russian Army, self-propelled and towed artillery pieces, multiple rocket launcher systems, TOS-1A ""Solntsepyok"" heavy flamethrower systems and considerable amount of ammunition. In 2010, Russia’s Rosoboronexport arms exporter signed a similar contract with Uganda worth $700 million. Uganda and Angola are not Rosoboronexport’s only clients in Africa to the south of the Sahara desert. Last year, Nigeria purchased several Russian transport and military helicopters. A source close to Russia’s arms exporter says contracts may soon be signed with such fast growing African countries as Cameroon and Mozambique. X X X AIRLINES CHANGE THEIR MIND ON FOREIGN PILOTS - IZVESTIYA According to the Izvestiya daily, Russian airlines are reluctant to employ foreign pilots. Only 33 foreign specialists were offered jobs last year, though the maximum permitted number of foreign pilots stands at 200. On the one hand, the complicated economic situation in Russia has forced many large and small airlines to lay off its workers, which in turn led to excessive number of Russian pilots on the labor market. On the other hand, foreigners often refuse to work in Russia as the current currency exchange rate is not profitable for them. X X X NOT RIGHT SECTOR - KOMMERSANT A year and a half after ousting President Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian authorities now face a new challenge coming from the most radical force at Euromaidan - the Right Sector organization. The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Right Sector fighters in the town of Mukachyovo provoked several clashes all around the country, including in Kiev. Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko and Verkhovna Rada Vladimir Groysman have called for ""disarming illegal groupings."" According to deputies and experts polled by the Kommersant daily, the decisiveness of the Ukrainian forces signifies the new stage in building Ukrainian statehood which requires Kiev to put an end to nationalist groups that often have ties with criminal circles. If radicals refuse to fulfill Kiev’s orders and continue resistance, the situation may take an unexpected turn. X X X RUSSIA TO INCREASE NUMBER OF STRATEGIC BOMBERS BY THREE TIMES - NEZAVISIMIAYA GAZETA Russia has started modernizing its combat fleet of strategic aviation. The work on assembling Tu-160 strategic bombers (""Black Swan"") has already started. Preparations are underway for constructing new powerful tanker aircraft on the basis of wide-body passenger aircraft Il-96-400. Russian President Vladimir Putin used to fly on a Il-96-400 plane. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said on Saturday that construction of the new tanker aircraft may soon begin at Voronezh Shareholder Aircraft-Building Society (VASO). Il-96-400 is manufactured only at VASO because only this aircraft plant has necessary slipways for these planes. X X X THREE DAYS, TWO SUMMITS, ONE CITY - NOVYE IZVESTIYA On July 10, the summits of BRICS largest emerging economies and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) finished in Ufa. Experts say that both these events have great geopolitical importance that transcends separate interests of participating countries. In particular, BRICS association has launched its first financial institutions that underline the growing influence of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa on global economy. Meanwhile, the SCO summit became a platform for dialogue between traditional rivals. Moreover, the organization admitted new members. However, some experts say that not all expectations were fulfilled at the Ufa’s summits. X X X SOCIAL CUTS - NOVYE EZVESTIYA Russia’s Finance Ministry published a report on July 10 that says more than 50 percent of Russians receive social payments groundlessly. According to the ministry, this part of the population cannot be considered ""in need."" The more budget funds are allocated to the existing system of social support, the more social inequality develops, the finance ministry noted. The report draws attention to the urgent need to find additional funds in the conditions of continuing economic downturn. The Novye Izvestiya daily reminded that the ministry already proposed in June to save around 2.36 trillion rubles on decreasing indexation of pensions and other social payments in 2016-2018. X X X NORTHERN WIND - ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Russia has opened a tourist office in Helsinki. The ""Visit Russia"" company will cover all Scandinavian counties - Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Russia also plans to open tourist offices in Beijing, Berlin and Rome this year. In 2016, affiliates will also start working in Madrid, Paris and Milan. X X X RUSSIANS PREFER VACATIONING IN GREECE - MOSKOVSKY KOMSOMOLETS Russian statistics service Rosstat has announced data on foreign tourism in the first half of 2015. The number of Russians going abroad for vacation has decreased by 40 percent, to a total of slightly more than 2 million trips. ""From January to June, we saw a decline in the number of Russians who go abroad for tourism by 40 percent,"" Rosturizm head Oleg Safronov said. ""Along with that, the number of people who came to Russia for tourism, has grown by 16 percent. The structure of incoming tourism has changed. Less tourists come from Europe and US, and more tourists arrive from the Asia-Pacific,"" he added. The summer season has started rather optimistically, despite a drastic fall in the beginning of the year. Popular tourist destinations - Turkey, Egypt, Greece - welcomed the same number of tourist from Russia as in last year. Despite a financial crisis in Greece, Russian companies note the growing number of Russian tourists planning to go to the Hellenic Republic for vacation.

NOIRWAY,Norway,"What makes Oslo tick? Mark Medley is on the case, exploring the city through the eyes of homegrown crime writer Jo Nesbo On the last afternoon in May, I found myself walking down a side street in downtown Oslo, on the way to a crime scene. The small group with me was composed of an equally morbid bunch, including a mother and her young daughter. They appeared excited to be here. It had been raining off and on throughout the day, and the sidewalk was mostly empty. Although we were just a few blocks south off the Norwegian capital's main strip, Karl Johans gate, which begins at the Royal Palace and drifts southeast past shops and restaurants toward Oslo's usually bustling central train station, I felt like I was in a different city altogether. “It's about seeing Oslo from a new angle,"" explained our tour guide, Mari Atlanta Lunde, perhaps sensing my uncertainty. Truth be told, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see the city formerly known as Kristiania from this angle. I knew from the map that we were only a few blocks from the staggering Oslo Opera House, which opened to great fanfare in 2008, a white marble- and granite-clad edifice that, from a distance, looks to be sliding into the chilly waters of the Oslofjorden like a giant into a bath. This is what visitors come to see! Lunde, though, was leading us through a part of town unlikely to be promoted by the tourism bureau. This was the realm of sadistic serial killers and corrupt cops, of brutal violence and rampant crime. In books, at least. I was in the middle of a Harry Hole walking tour. Harry, for those whose literary tastes don't include crime fiction, is the detective (anti-) hero of 10 wildly successful novels written by Oslo's own Jo Nesbo, described last year as Norway's “first international pop-culture star"" by The New Yorker. His books, which include several stand-alone novels (including Blood on Snow, which was released in Canada in April) and a series for middle-grade readers (Doctor Proctor's Fart Powder), have sold more than 20 million copies combined and appeared in almost 50 languages around the world. Nesbo, one of the country's main cultural exports, is also responsible for a slew of imports, namely tourists eager to see the real-life haunts of their favourite fictional detective, even if they aren't always particularly exciting. Walking east on Tollbugata, we arrived at a yellowing four-storey building called the Sentrum Pensjonat, the real-life inspiration for a fictional hostel where Harry stays in the ninth novel, Phantom. The hostel is “among the cheapest places you can stay in Oslo,"" said Lunde, which was actually good to know considering the city consistently ranks among the world's most expensive. “I've heard of a few people who've stayed here because they're Harry Hole fans."" She led us inside, up a winding staircase, and over to a bemused receptionist, who agreed to hand over the key to Room 301, where Harry bunks down. “Oh, I've never been in here,"" she told us excitedly after unlocking the door, as if we were inside a cordoned-off room in the Royal Palace and not a dreary room filled with four beds, a bar fridge and a small wooden table. Lunde, an affable 65-year-old schoolteacher who conducts this tour on a weekly basis, was dressed in a black T-shirt dripping with (fake) blood with the word “Politi"" printed across its chest – the Norwegian title of the most recent entry in the series, 2013's Police. She was also wearing a pair of snowman earrings, a nod to Nesbo's grisly 2010 novel of the same name. Later, leading the tour through Gronland, a vibrant and heavily multicultural neighbourhood in the city's east end, Lunde admitted that, when she founded the tour in 2011, she had never read one of Nesbo's books; she has now read them all multiple times. (“My husband's very jealous of him,"" she said, though I wasn't sure if she meant Nesbo or Harry.) In any case, she was having a blast guiding the group on the two-hour tour of the city, which ranged from a scenic walk along the Akerselva River that snakes through town – a perfect place to dump a body – to the police headquarters where Harry plies his trade. You don't have to have read the Harry Hole novels to enjoy the tour, which mostly attracts guests from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, as it focuses on Oslo and its history as much as the fictional detective. When, the following night, I mentioned to Nesbo that I had taken the tour – while Lunde obtained his approval, he doesn't profit from it – he seemed slightly embarrassed, though also a bit curious: “How was it?"" he asked. We were picking away at plates of sashimi at a sushi joint near his home, just across the street from Frogner Park and the Vigelandsparken, which, even at this hour, was filled with tourists taking selfies with artist Gustav Vigeland's bronze statues. With more than a million visitors a year, it's one of the city's most popular attractions, even though it can be rendered creepy in Nesbo's work. “I certainly don't try to portray Oslo in a realistic way,"" said Nesbo, 55, who was born here, moved away at a young age, and returned for good in 1986. “That was never my goal. But I use the real Oslo because it's convenient, because it's easy, and it gives authenticity to the story that you can't really make up. Then again, it's a bit more twisted."" If anything, the fact that Oslo is now fertile ground for a series of bestselling crime novels is something to be celebrated. His latest book, Blood on Snow, a taut thriller about a hit man who falls in love with one of his targets, is set in the 1970s, “back when Oslo was a really small city. It's not that it's grown much, but it has opened up to the world. Back then, it was a village on the outskirts of Europe, really. Nothing really happened here. … Norway was one of the three poorest countries in Europe. The city and the country and the people have transformed ever since we found oil – actually, the Americans found oil – in the late sixties. “It became a much more interesting city."" With an equally interesting literary scene. Nesbo is one of several Norwegian writers who have recently achieved success on the international stage – Karl Ove Knausgaard, Per Petterson, Karin Fossum, Erlend Loe, Anne Holt, Thomas Enger and others – which is especially impressive considering the country boasts a population similar to that of Costa Rica. “Norway is, by some people outside Norway, presumed to be the capital of Sweden or something,"" Andreas Wise, the executive director of Norway's House of Literature, said over lunch in the building's ground-floor restaurant, which doubles as a bookstore. (The litteraturhuset – the largest such building in Europe – is a tourist attraction in its own right; opened in 2007 and located across the street from the Royal Palace, it's the sun around which the country's literary community revolves, hosting more than 1,500 events each year, and providing work spaces for dozens of writers, free of charge.) “The identity of a small country is hard to raise awareness about. So, we have skiing and we have books. And, together, we're an Arctic skiing country with an incredible amount of very brilliant writers, which is a good image to have. It would be sad if they thought we were a bunch of illiterates who only went skiing."" Leaving the litteraturhuset, if you cut south across the gardens of the Royal Palace – you can watch the changing of the guards each day at 1:30 p.m., or, if you have more time, take a one-hour guided tour – you'll end up at the Ibsen Museum, a shrine, of sorts, to the country's best-known writer, playwright Henrik Ibsen, the second-most popular playwright in the world (only the plays of William Shakespeare are performed more). The museum is housed in the apartment where he lived from 1895 until his death in 1906. (His last words were “On the contrary,"" said after his wife, Suzannah, told a visitor that her recently ill husband was feeling better.) The museum features a tour of his apartment, which has been partly restored to its former glory, as well as exhibitions devoted to Ibsen's life and work. (Turn right when leaving the museum and follow the quotes carved into the sidewalk down to the Grand Hotel Oslo and its historic Grand Café, opened in 1874, where Ibsen lunched each day.) Head north on Akersgata from the Grand Café and you'll soon wind up at the Deichmanske bibliotek, the city library. Margaret Atwood was in town the same week as me, dropping off Scribbler Moon, the first instalment in the Future Library project: Each year, a different writer will submit a manuscript that will not be read until 2114. The entire collection is to be housed in a purposebuilt room in the new Deichman library, scheduled to open on the waterfront in 2018, next to the Opera House, where a new Munchmuseet, devoted to the work of Norway's most famous painter, will be built, too. Meaning that there will still be reason for book lovers to visit Oslo a century from now. Mark Medley is The Globe and Mail's Books editor.

From $237 (1,495 Norwegian Krone); radissonblu.no/plazahotell-oslo . WHERE TO EAT If you want to combine dinner with a little sightseeing, check out Nodee Asian Cooking (Middelthuns gate 25), a stellar East Asian fusion restaurant (with a patio to match) just across the street from Frogner Park. If you're on the Harry Hole diet, try to grab a table at Schroder (Waldemar Thranes gate 8), a traditional Norwegian restaurant (opened circa 1925) that doubles as one of Harry's favourite haunts. WHAT TO READ If you haven't read any of Nesbo's books, I recommend starting with The Son, a standalone thriller that doesn't feature Harry Hole. Stop by Tronsmo Bokhandel (Kristian Augusts gate 19), which features an eclectic array of Norwegian and English-language titles. It's around the corner from the National Gallery. WHAT TO DO Once you've read all the Harry Hole novels, take the walking tour.

Ruble follows oil price down,Norway,"Russia's currency has dropped considerably along with the price of crude oil. It's a reminder of the Russian economy's extraordinary level of dependency on fossil fuel exports, pundits say. Foreign exchange traders in Moscow on Monday saw the ruble sink 2.3 percent to a new low for the year. At one point during the day's trading it took 71.2 rubles to buy a dollar (81.6 rubles bought a euro). Russia's currency has lost more than 20 percent against the dollar in the past two months - and has declined in value against the euro by nearly half since May. Speaking to the press at the weekend, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev acknowledged the cause of the ruble's slide: The currency's close linkage to the global oil price. ""The most important thing in this sort of situation is not to get nervous, and to avoid making hasty decisions,"" he said. China stalls, oil falls, ruble follows Oil prices fell 4 percent to their lowest level since six and a half years ago. The proximate cause: Chinese stock markets saw their biggest one-day drop since the global financial crisis, increasing worries that a major economic slowdown could ensue in China that would bring a reduction in global oil demand in tow. The ruble most closely tracks the price of ""Brent crude"" - oil of the type produced in the North Sea off Britain and Norway. The price of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $44.20 in trading on Monday, the lowest level since March 2009. Russia's dollar-denominated RTS stock index fell nearly 4.5 percent by 11 AM GMT on Monday, and the ruble-denominated Micex index dropped 1.76 percent before recovering slightly in afternoon trade. The woes of a single-commodity-driven economy A low ruble means higher prices for imported goods, and so Russia has a high consumer price inflation rate. The average annualised rate in 2015 stands at 16 percent. Interest rates set by the Russian central bank are correspondingly high, with the key rate currently at 11 percent. Russians are also taking fewer holidays abroad in view of their currency's reduced purchasing power, which has dampened tourism business in European destinations favored by Russians, such as the Mediterranian island of Cyprus. The net result of low oil and gas prices: Russia is in recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 4.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier. Russian authorities have projected that the country's GDP will contract by 2.8 percent this year, before picking up again next year. But any turnaround will be contingent on a sustained recovery in oil prices. nz / hg (dpa, AFP, Reuters)"
"Letters, Aug. 24",Norway,"Revenge of the twits I'm a proud left-wing twit who doesn't tweet, but can recognize a right-wing boob like letter-writer Cal Paul (Tweeters a bunch of twits, Letters, Aug. 20). The naive are those who believe Stephen Harper isn't up to his neck in the Conservative fraud trial of Mike Duffy. Meanwhile, letter-writer Terry Meindl is naive to believe Harper is an employer (Harper's responsibility questioned, Letters, Aug. 20). It's the Canadian taxpayer who is the employer – Harper is nothing more than a Conservative party representative whom they chose as their leader, and by the misfortunes of our misguided election process is prime minister over a majority of Canadians who did not vote for or want him. Sorry for being such a twit. Don Halligan Winnipeg It's wonderful that Cal Paul enjoys reading the letters to the editor in the Free Press and yes, it's a great forum to have readers express their opinions, leading to debate on serious issues. But it seems he only enjoys those letters that conform to his point of view; when they don't, he resorts to name-calling. But then, the prime minister's supporters who appear at his rallies have set the example for name-calling – is this the kind of thoughtful debate to which Paul was referring? Marjorey Dwornick Winnipeg Nationalize oil and gas industry Recent letters, the latest being from Edward Katz, skate around the problem of gasoline prices (Reducing the sting of gas hike, Letters, Aug. 19). The solution is to nationalize the oil and gas industry – to bring it into public ownership so prices can be investigated and regulated by the government. All profits from Canadian oil and gas would then be for the benefit of Canadian citizens, not privately owned corporations. Norway has done it, and now has a massive oil fund and the highest standard of living in the world. Compare that to the meagre return Canada's oil has given Canadians, whose standard of living is sinking fast. Ray Kathwaroon Winnipeg Hunting for justice The article Hunting critical to conservation (Aug. 19) by Manitoba Wildlife Federation managing director Rob Olson is simplistic. According to Olson, we should kill animals in order to save them. If this is the position of the Manitoba Wildlife Federation I am deeply disappointed, and his organization will not receive any donations from me. Paul Turenne, executive director of the Manitoba Lodges and Outfitters Association, is obviously not an objective observer – he makes a living by arranging for the killing of animals (Debate impossible in face of rage, Aug.19). Many people are enraged by the trophy hunting of the American dentist Walter Palmer, who reportedly spent $50,000 in order to arrange the killing of Cecil the lion. Get used to the rage, Mr. Turenne – you are going to experience a lot more in future. The world has changed. Is the hunting in Africa of lions, elephants and other wild animals really necessary? Why don't they organize more sightseeing safaris, events that would allow tourists to shoot lions and other wild creatures with cameras rather than rifles? The Churchill polar bear tour is a prime example of what can be done; the bears are not shot, beheaded and mounted in homes and businesses.

Canadian agency deciding Shell’s offshore drilling includes ex-Shell official,Norway,"News of Tory-appointed official follows on Environment Minister granting Shell up to 21 days to stop underwater oil spills The agency tasked with giving approval for Shell’s deep-water drilling off Canada’s east coast includes a Tory-appointed official who worked for Shell for decades, it has emerged. Shell’s billion-dollar plans for exploratory drilling 200 km from Nova Scotia’s southern shore have been green-lighted by Canada’s Environment Minister, but they await a final review this fall by the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board. The Petroleum Board includes as a board member Douglas Gregory, who spent three decades working for Shell Canada and Royal Dutch Shell. Gregory opened Shell Canada’s exploration office in Nova Scotia and oversaw early deep-water seismic exploration off the coast before retiring in 2003. He was appointed to the Petroleum Board by the federal Conservative government in 2007. The conflict-of-interest revelations will provoke anger over an already controversial project that has been criticized by fishermen, First Nations and environmental organizations. In June, Conservative Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaqsparked[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/shell-gets-ok-to-take-21-days-to-cap-blowouts-off-nova-scotia-coast-1.3179496] an outcry by approving a plan that would allow Shell up to 21 days to cap any oil blowouts. In contrast the United States requires Shell to have capping equipment on-site in Alaska within 24 hours. Shell plans to save money by not keeping the equipment on standby in Nova Scotia, instead shipping it when necessary by boat from Norway. An underwater oil spill off the coast could do irreparable damage to marine life and the fishing and tourism industries vital to the economy of eastern Canada. The Conservative government has been widely criticized for overhauling Canada’s environmental laws to make it easier to win quick approval for such resource projects. Federal environmental reviews of the sort conducted for Shell’s drilling plans now happen with shortened timelines and drastically restricted public participation, and only for projects determined by the federal government. The Harper government has cut 40 percent of the budget of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and fired hundreds of scientists who contributed to environmental reviews. “The Canadian system of environmental oversight wasn’t very effective to start with, but the current government has made it much worse. They’ve sidelined departments with an ecological perspective or gutted their scientific capacity, and are moving toward making captive agencies like the Petroleum Board solely responsible for environmental assessments. At this rate, Nova Scotians may be watching in horror as an oil spill continues for weeks,” said Mark Butler, policy director of the Ecology Action Centre. Since its election in 2006, the Conservative government has appointed dozens of former industry insiders or government officials with no environmental expertise to the agencies that oversee offshore oil and gas exploration. In what Butler decries as yet further erosion of environment protections, the Conservative government introduced legislation last month that will strip the federal environment assessment agency of its power to continue reviews of oil and gas projects around Nova Scotia and hand authority to the Petroleum Board. Former Nova Scotia premier and provincial Progressive Conservative party leader Rodney MacDonald was another recent Conservative appointment to the Petroleum Board. Gregory was a voting member until last year and has since become an alternate, voting when other members are unavailable, while also chairing the Health, Safety and Environment Advisory Committee. He worked for thirty years as a manager and geophysicist and also did a stint with Canada’s largest oil lobby group. A communications advisor for the Petroleum Board said Gregory has never voted on an issue that had to do with Shell but could not say if he has formally recused himself from all discussions around the drilling plan. “Anything related to a conflict-of interest matter would have to be asked of the federal government,” the advisor said. The federal government referred questions to the Petroleum Board. A petition calling[http://action.sumofus.org/a/shell-21-day-blowout/?sub=tw] on the Board to refuse approval of Shell’s drilling plans has gathered more than 50,000 Canadian signatures. Shell’s efforts[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/shell-gets-final-clearance-to-begin-drilling-for-oil-in-the-arctic] to drill for oil further north in the Arctic have faced a global campaign, with US Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton recently adding her voice to the opposition. * Martin Lukacs writes for the Guardian: @Martin_Lukacs[http://www.twitter.com/Martin_Lukacs] Tim Groves is a freelance investigative journalist: @TimMGroves[http://www.twitter.com/TimMGroves]"
Nature's last refuge: climate change threatens our most fragile ecosystem,Norway,"An Arctic voyage through the awe-inspiring Northwest Passage shows that, with oil drilling in the far north on the way, rapid action is needed to protect the region The Northwest Passage is not an obvious choice for a holiday cruise. It is, after all, one of the most notorious ocean routes. Many hundreds of sailors died in opening up the seaway, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via the Canadian Arctic, before it was conquered just over a century ago. But the Arctic today is changing. Global warming is altering it at a rate that is unmatched anywhere else on Earth, and a journey once considered grotesquely dangerous has become a voyage now feasible for the inquiring traveller. Today you can sail through the Northwest Passage, as I did last week, on a ship that offers hot-tubs, bars and restaurants, albeit with armed protection against polar bears and kit for keeping out the cold. Related: Journey through the Northwest Passage – in pictures[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/aug/30/journey-through-the-northwest-passage-in-pictures] By contrast, in 1845 John Franklin’s expedition to find the Northwest Passage was utterly defeated by the Arctic, even though his ships, the Erebus and Terror, were equipped with steam-powered engines, tinned food and other wonders of 19th-century technology. Trapped in the ice for several years, all 129 men on board died, many resorting to cannibalism as the end neared. But 170 years on, ships have strengthened hulls, global positioning receivers, radar and powerful engines. Hence the ease with which our liner – the Akademik Sergey Vavilov research vessel, operated by One Ocean Expeditions[http://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/] – made its 12-day, 1,945-nautical-mile journey from Kangerlussuaq in Western Greenland, across Baffin Bay, on to desolate Beechey Island (where some of Franklin’s men are buried), down through the Bellot Strait and past King William Island – near where the wreck of the Erebus was discovered last year – and into the little port of Cambridge Bay. Most of the voyage was made on seas generally free of ice and which were as calm as mill ponds, revealing some of the world’s most bleakly beautiful landscapes: mist-shrouded cliffs, ice floes that stretch to the horizon, and aboriginal settlements, some of them thousands of years old. However, there is another factor that made this journey possible, one that reveals the darker side of humanity’s scientific might and which provides the most intriguing aspect of any Arctic visit. Every year our factories and cars pump billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and emissions continue to rise remorselessly. As a result, our planet is heating at a worrying rate, with the Arctic bearing the brunt of temperature rises[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/17/antarctica-sea-ice-record-high-arctic-sixth-lowest-extent]. Every year the melting of sea ice in the far north starts earlier and earlier and it is now vanishing at a rate of about 13% per decade. As a result, the Arctic’s sea ice cap has shrunk by nearly a third since 1979, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre[http://nsidc.org/]. Finding enough ice in which to get trapped is becoming the Arctic’s real problem. That erosion of ice is likely only to worsen, scientists warn. Ice reflects radiation. But if it disappears, and reveals below it the Arctic’s dark waters, which are much better than ice at absorbing heat, less and less solar radiation will be reflected back into space and the Arctic will warm up even more. Indeed, many scientists now believe the Arctic could be free of sea ice in summer within a few decades. It is difficult to assess what will be the consequences. Most experts believe they will be profoundly damaging. As Eric Solomon, director of Arctic programmes for the Vancouver Aquarium, puts it: “Sea ice is the foundation for life here.” In removing that foundation, humanity is carrying out a highly dangerous experiment – on a colossal scale. Consider the simple issue of algae. It grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals. Take away the bottom rung of this food chain and all sorts of unintended consequences could be realised. Then there are the narwhals. These tusked whales – sometimes called the unicorns of the sea – are prized by Inuits who use their blubber and skin to make a traditional, extraordinarily chewy meal called muktuk. (It’s an acquired taste, I discovered.) Narwhals can hide, safely, in sea ice and so avoid their natural predator, the killer whale. Robbed of that protection, narwhal numbers could dwindle dangerously, marine biologists warn. Polar bears are also likely to suffer. These creatures are magnificent hunters. They can smell their favourite prey, ringed seals, from more than a kilometre, even though the seals may be hiding under snow. It is thought there are about 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic, made up of separate populations in 20 different regions. Unfortunately there have been few long-term studies of Ursus maritimus and half of these different populations are simply rated as being in an uncertain status. However, in well-studied populations, such as those around the town of Churchill, on the Hudson Bay, research indicates that the body sizes of polar bears – and their birthrates – are declining as the climate warms. “This does not bode well,” says Canadian naturalist Franco Mariotti. Then there is the impact on humans. For Inuits, sea ice not only helps protect the local food chain, it acts as a highway on which they can ride their skiddoos and dog sleds to hunt and to visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of local communities and limits the ability of people to hunt. This problem is only likely to get worse as the region is opened for mining and oil drilling. This month Barack Obama gave final approval for Shell to drill into potential oil reserves beneath the sea floor of the Arctic Ocean[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/shell-gets-final-clearance-to-begin-drilling-for-oil-in-the-arctic]. The move was denounced as “potentially catastrophic” by Greenpeace, while Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, a US environmental organisation, said the decision “goes against science, the will of the people and common sense”. Concerns have been raised over Shell’s ability to clean up a spill, should one occur, in an area covered by sea ice for much of the year. If one considers the example of the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico,[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/02/bp-will-pay-largest-environmental-fine-in-us-history-for-gulf-oil-spill] it took 87 days to cap, even though it happened in a fairly accessible region. In the Arctic, which is virtually impenetrable in winter, a similar gusher would be far more difficult to tackle. More to the point, the region’s ecology is about the most fragile on the planet and would be far more vulnerable to the impact of a major spill. Take the landscape on the south shore of Devon Island. At 74° north, it is swept by ferocious, freezing gales which, in winter, send temperatures plunging to minus 50C. The island has a polar desert climate with hardly any precipitation. Yet life clings to this bleak wilderness. My walk there a few days ago revealed an astonishing array of plants hugging the ground to survive: willows, which grow as trees in the UK but which, up here, shrink up to the size of twigs to keep out of the gales. In addition, the Arctic campion, or lantern flower, provides unique protection for its seeds, housed in a minuscule globe that acts like a greenhouse. These adaptations are vivid illustrations of life’s extraordinary resilience, though they would be quite incapable of withstanding any major environmental disaster. Related: Can Shell afford Arctic oil? | Karl Mathiesen[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/can-shell-afford-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic] Across Lancaster Sound, the lowering cliffs of Prince Leopold Island provide another demonstration of the vulnerability of the region’s wildlife. The steep cliffs of this Unesco world heritage site provide refuge for thousands of black-legged kittiwakes, fulmars, black guillemots and thick-billed murre, creating a vast, mist-shrouded citadel of screaming, winged wildlife. The island is one of the world’s most important refuges for migratory birds and again is highly vulnerable, as so many other areas of the Arctic, to ecological mishap. It is not just the risk that oil drilling poses to the Arctic that causes consternation, however. It is the extraordinary notion that it is a good idea to take advantage of a problem that has been caused by our over-dependence on fossil fuels – by drilling for even more fossil fuel. Hence Friends of the Earth’s furious denunciation of the decision to let the Arctic’s pristine Chukchi Sea[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/can-shell-afford-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic] “become an energy sacrifice zone [that will only] worsen climate disruption”. The real problem that faces the Arctic is its uncertain political status, a point that is clearly demonstrated by comparing the region with its southerly counterpart, the Antarctic. The latter is controlled by the Antarctic Treaty, which bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military. It also strictly controls all environmental hazards. By contrast, the Arctic is owned by a ragbag of nations – Russia, Canada, the US, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark (through its dependency, Greenland) – which have very different ideas about how to run the place and which have shown no inclination to outlaw mining or oil drilling or impose cast-iron environmental controls. Apart from the environmental risks that they pose, increasing mining and drilling operations will have many other consequences. Ships will end up crisscrossing the region for increasing numbers of days. The Inuits’ icy highways will be broken up even more while the region’s bowhead, blue and beluga whales face the prospect of their underwater communications being disrupted or blocked in these once quiet waters. Rubbish is also a problem. In Antarctica, every piece of waste is removed from the continent. In the Arctic, no such rule is invoked, as is demonstrated by the container vessels of washing machines and other household goods that arrive in summer as the ice melts and ports like Kangerlussuaq and Sisimuit in Greenland and Port Inlet in Canada open up. These once-a-year imports, booked online months in advance, provide local householders with the means to modernise their homes. Crucially, the containers that brought them return empty. No attempt is made to ship away the old household goods that have been replaced. They are simply left to rust in the air. In short, what arrives in the north, stays in the north: a small but significant demonstration of the casual indifference that is adopted when dealing with environmental issues in the region. The Arctic remains a place of extraordinary beauty that is inhabited by some of the planet’s most remarkable animals. But time is running out. The region needs protection on the scale that has been meted out to the Antarctic, an idea recently backed by a House of Lords report on the Arctic[http://www.parliament.uk/arcticcom]. As peers remarked, current approaches to protecting the Arctic are far too hesitant and cautious. In this, they are almost certainly correct. Whether we have time to bring meaningful improvements is a different matter. Change is sweeping the far north. Time is not on its side. Pressure points Global warming is bringing major changes. Mining The Arctic contains large quantities of iron ore, copper and nickel and new mines are being planned and constructed to exploit these, raising worries about pollution. Proposals to drill for oil have also triggered concerns about threats to the region’s delicate ecology. Tourism Cruise expeditions into the Arctic are expected to expand significantly, bringing in more and more tourists while placing strain on the environment and the region’s few, small towns. Politics Control of the region and its transport routes is hotly disputed by the eight Arctic nations. Canada, for example, claims the North west Passage as national sovereign waters. The US says it is an international waterway."

Here’s a smaller-scale indicator of how the tenor of things up north appears to be changing. When I went to the North Pole[http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/science/20030513_NORTH/] in the spring of 2003, the only activity on the floating, shifting sea ice other than the research being conducted[http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/science/20030513_NORTH/] by the team I accompanied was polar-style tourism centered at a Russian base camp[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/28/international/28POLE.html] variously called Barneo[http://www.icetrek.com/barneo-ice-camp.html] and Borneo[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14614977]. There was a Russian millionaire snowboarding behind a skimobile, a parasailing Belgian adventurer, a Moscow beauty pageant contestant dancing with Father Christmas[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlq3ggZtGsQ]. Last year, 50 or so Russian paratroopers[http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/2014/04/russian-paratroopers-conquer-north-pole-10-04]dropped to the sea ice[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w32kaOYb7lo#t=31] near the polar camp. This spring, scientists conducting polar ice and ocean research told me they were unnerved to see a Russian military encampment nearby for the first time. Their observations came right around the time Dmitri O. Rogozin, a Russian deputy prime minister fond of tweaking the West[http://www.rt.com/politics/251209-russia-rogozin-svalbard-ministry/], visited the North Pole camp, posting “The Arctic is Russian Mecca[https://twitter.com/DRogozin/status/590025163166613504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]” on Twitter. Such issues won’t be on the table as Air Force One wings its way west and north, even though the president’s first appearance will come Monday at an ambitiously titled Anchorage event — the Conference on Global Leadership in the Arctic: Cooperation, Innovation, Engagement and Resilience[http://www.state.gov.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/e/oes/glacier/index.htm]. While the United States this year rotated into its two-year stint leading the eight-nation Arctic Council[http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/about-us/arctic-council/canadian-chairmanship], this meeting is an unrelated informal session, organized by the State Department and other agencies around a distinctly uncontroversial agenda, ranging from basic science to energy-efficient cold-weather design tips: – The Arctic’s Unique Role in Influencing the Global Climate – Building the Resilience of Arctic Coastal Communities in the Face of Climate Change – Strengthening International Preparedness and Cooperation for Emergency Response – Focus Session on Climate Resilience and Adaptation Planning – Protecting Communities and the Environment through Climate and Air Quality Projects – Preventing Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean – Strengthening Arctic Cooperation and Coordination on Ocean Stewardship, Environmental Protection, and Support to Local Communities – Healthy Arctic Homes: Designing Cold Climate Structures for the 21st Century (Addressing Health, Efficiency, & Resiliency through Innovative Housing Technologies) – Strengthening Observation Networks A New Cold War? The low-key tone of Obama’s Alaskan tour is appropriate. Behind the Russian bluster, the Arctic geopolitical temperature hasn’t changed that much. Resources and shipping routes have long been the source of disputes. Even the United States and Canada have had diplomatic tussles, particularly over whether the fabled Northwest Passage through Canada’s mazelike Arctic archipelago is an international navigation route or subject to Canadian control. The 1969 Northwest Passage transit by the SS Manhattan[http://sunshiporg.homestead.com/manhattan.html], an American supertanker refitted with an icebreaker’s bow by Humble Oil, was mostly depicted as a gutsy effort to test ways to get newly discovered North Slope oil to markets. A public relations firm even created a mock Northwest Passage board game[http://www.games-collector.com/boardgame/n/northwest-passage-1969.html] for Humble Oil to promote the Manhattan’s achievement. But freedom of navigation was a subtext. As described in American University’s Inventory of Conflict and Environment,[http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/northwest-passage.htm] the tanker’s owner, Humble Oil, “cooperating closely with the U.S. government, deliberately opted to neglect requests made by the Canadian government to seek its approval before traveling through the Canadian Arctic to the new oil fields on the Alaskan North Slope.” In 1970, Canadian politicians expressed alarm that the United States was going to bolster its icebreaker fleet, presumably to aid American ships in such transits. Another test of the right to navigate the Northwest Passage came in 1985. As The Times reported[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/01/world/us-ship-s-arctic-voyage-draws-heat-in-canada.html]: Without asking permission, the United States notified Canada in May that the heavy icebreaker Polar Sea would sail from Greenland to Alaska along the Arctic waterway that explorers once thought to be a way to Asia. Washington considers the Northwest Passage an international strait open to shipping. Ottawa says the route, which passes among islands claimed by Canada, lies within its territory. Still, such Arctic tussles have been resolved through negotiation and compromise. Maybe things tend to get worked out better in the Arctic because of the harshness of conditions and the distance from bureaucracies. As I found on my 2003 sea ice trip, when three scientists with advanced degrees crouched on the sea ice[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/13/science/doing-science-at-the-top-of-the-world.html] in 20-below temperatures (Fahrenheit) to fix a broken winch, you have to work things out on your own up there. You’ll find a long list of stories when you search the Web for “New Cold War[https://www-google-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/search?q=cold+war+new&oq;=cold+war+new+&aqs;=chrome..69i57j0l5.2479j0j4&sourceid;=chrome&es;_sm=119&ie;=UTF-8#q=%22new+cold+war%22+arctic+russia],” but I wouldn’t count on things overheating any time soon. The best argument for why this is the case was made in 2010 in Foreign Policy by Lawson W. Brigham[https://www.uaf.edu/snre/faculty/brigham/], a former Coast Guard icebreaker captain and leader of a major study of Arctic shipping trends who is now Distinguished Professor of Geography & Arctic Policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. As he wrote[http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/08/06/think-again-the-arctic/]: Today’s Arctic is governed by eight developed states that arguably cooperate more than they have at any other period in history. International collaboration in scientific research, for instance, is at record levels in the Arctic today. The looming Arctic resource boom doesn’t threaten this stability — it reinforces it. States such as Norway and Russia have much to lose economically from Arctic conflict, as do the many non-Arctic countries and multinational corporations that will be among the eventual investors in, and consumers of, future Arctic ventures…. A Bloomberg News story on Friday[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-28/arctic-nations-joust-but-north-pole-payoff-may-be-decades-away] built on Brigham’s thesis, noting other reasons why the Arctic rush (that was the title of a 2005 Discovery Times Channel documentary[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVTZg8JRRY8] I worked on) will be a relatively slow affair: Falling commodity prices are discouraging exploration for Arctic oil and gas, while new trade routes across the top of the world are falling short of expectations. “Arctic development is a lot slower than people thought,” says Malte Humpert, executive director of the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based policy group. “The hype is wearing off. It’ll be many, many years before we see the development people have been talking about.” On this front, I also encourage you to read “The truth about politics and cartography: mapping claims to the Arctic seabed[https://theconversation.com/the-truth-about-politics-and-cartography-mapping-claims-to-the-arctic-seabed-46043],” an illuminating recent piece by Philip Steinberg, the director of the Center for Borders Research at Britain’s Durham University. He says: In short, little is actually happening on the international seabed – in the Arctic or elsewhere – other than states using science to claim the limited economic rights that are reserved for them by international law. These filings should therefore be celebrated as reaffirmations of the will toward peace and stability, rather than feared as unilateral acts of aggression. Here’s a map from his research group showing how little Russia’s claim has changed since 2001: Oil and Alaska On the main domestic issue, balancing oil needs and environmental concerns, there’ll be no simple answers up north. Alaska defies simple stereotypes, with its indigenous communities as divided as the United States more broadly over the risks and merits of oil extraction. Kirk Johnson’s fine curtain raiser on the trip[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/us/in-alaska-obama-will-be-in-middle-of-oil-and-climate-change-battle.html] in The Times has a section illustrating this divide: “It’s a battle for humanity,” said Ryan Joe, 26, an Alaska Native college student who was helping plan an anti-Arctic-drilling rally for Monday in downtown Anchorage, led by Greenpeace and other groups. “How is drilling somewhere going to make it better for the world?” Mr. Joe said…. An Alaska Native tribal group with investments in Arctic leases also began a statewide television advertising campaign[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUZOwUa56TQ&feature;=youtu.be] this week to coincide with the president’s visit. The tribe asserts that, contrary to the idea that drilling threatens native life, energy development is crucial to paying for the services that tribes depend on in remote places. The Arctic “is not a pristine snow globe that deserves to be tucked away and preserved,” said Tara Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, based in Barrow, in a telephone interview. Obama used his Saturday recorded message[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/08/29/weekly-address-meeting-global-threat-climate-change] to stress the need for action to cut emissions of greenhouse gases while recognizing that oil will continue to be needed for many years to come and, in his judgement, is best gotten domestically, with rigorous oversight. “The bottom line is, safety has been and will continue to be my administration’s top priority when it comes to oil and gas exploration off America’s precious coasts – even as we push our economy and the world to ultimately transition off of fossil fuels,” Obama said in his message on Saturday. Connecting Americans with their Arctic Perhaps the best thing about the trip will simply be to remind Americans in the contiguous states that this country has an Arctic Ocean coastline and that Arctic change — both climatic and geopolitical — resonates everywhere. It’s a challenge sustaining this kind of awareness, similar to that of Brazil engaging its southern urban residents with its vast Amazon rain forest. But it’s well worth doing. One thing is certain. Obama’s visit to Alaskan glaciers this week, aimed at connecting with his administration’s global warming policies, won’t include one of the diversions staged for President Warren G. Harding[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/warren_g_harding/index.html] on his Alaska voyage in 1923. Read the marvelous piece on that trip by George E. Condon, Jr., in the National Journal to get the idea. Here’s the opener: As President Obama embarks on the most ambitious presidential exploration of Alaska in U.S. history, he hopes to call attention to the threats facing that state’s precious and majestic glaciers, attending a State Department-sponsored conference on glaciers and meeting with locals concerned about their melting. That probably means he won’t do what the last president to spend a lot of time in Alaska did: have the Navy bombard a glacier for his amusement. That was part of the entertainment for President Harding during his historic tour of Alaska in July 1923. With the president aboard the USS Henderson going from Juneau to Skagway, the ship’s gunners fired several rounds of 5-inch shells into the wall of the Taku Glacier “so that Harding could watch the flashing ice avalanche,” according to Harding’s biographer, Francis Russell. What Harding saw is called “calving,” when huge chunks of ice “calv,” or break off, a glacier. “It is very dramatic. I’m sure President Harding liked that,” joked Michael Hawfield, an expert on Alaska history and an associate professor at the Kachemak Bay campus of Kenai Peninsula College in the University of Alaska system. [ Please read the rest.[http://www.nationaljournal.com/white-house/obama-heads-to-alaska-to-highlight-glaciers-not-blow-them-up-20150828]] Update, Aug. 30, 8:17 p.m. | I forgot to include a link to the transcript of a press call with a senior State Department official[http://www.state.gov.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/08/246429.htm] discussing the trip. Here’s my question and the reply: QUESTION: Thanks for hosting the call, and it’s kind of neat that the President will be above the Arctic Circle; it’s important. Two questions. One is about – there’s some environmental groups that are complaining about Arctic drilling approvals that the President has made seem to be in contrast with his concerns about global warming and the statements and recent videos related to the trip. And the other is about the Law of the Sea. Russia has been pushing harder; they had a military presence on the sea ice near the North Pole for the first time this spring and they’ve filed a new claim at the UN, and the U.S. has still not – even though Republican and Democratic presidents have pushed for it – gone ahead with the Law of the Sea ratification. So is that going to be part of his message? SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Thank you, Andrew. It’s good to hear from you. Let me address the drilling situation first. What I would say in response to that is yes, there are people who are protesting against the drilling; there are people that are upset and believe that the President has gone too far in terms of opening up the Arctic. There is an equal number of people who believe that the – it has not been opened up enough. And I’m not talking about the oil companies; I’m talking about the citizens of Alaska, and in particular, Alaskan natives. The people of Alaska want sustainable development that also protects the environment. There has to be a balance; the Administration has been taking a balanced approach to this. The Administration has been looking at alternate energy sources, renewable energy sources. But at the same time, in a very pragmatic approach, we understand that we’re going to need the petroleum products at least for the foreseeable future, and certain segments of the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea have been opened up for leases, and the companies that are up there have been doing things under a legal process and with strict review by the Department of Interior and the United States Coast Guard, and that is proceeding. So while not everybody’s happy, I think there has been a very balanced approach and Alaskans are interested in development and in fact, for some of them, they don’t think things are moving along fast enough. So as I said, it’s been a balanced approach by the Administration and the fact that we probably have parties on both sides of the issue that are not completely satisfied is probably an indicator that we’re on a fairly safe course here. As far as the Law of the Sea and Russian claims, I’ve been articulating this for the last month or so since the Russians have submitted their most recent claim: They are doing things entirely under the process of the Law of the Sea Treaty. They – and in fact, this is not the first time they’ve submitted a claim. They submitted a claim before and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf told them to go back and provide better science documenting their extended continental shelf claim. Much has been made over the fact that their claim includes the North Pole; not much of a fuss was made when Denmark made a similar claim. In fact, their claim encompasses the North Pole and a large section of the Arctic Ocean as well. And I’ve had preliminary looks at what Canada might submit as their claim; it also claims the North Pole and a rather large portion of the Arctic Ocean. So for me, it comes as no surprise that the Russians’ claim is so large; they have half the coastline of the Arctic Ocean and they have devoted a lot of science to documenting their claim, and they’re going through the proper process within the Law of the Sea Treaty. And my only regret is that the United States is not able to have standing under that treaty because we have not acceded to it yet. And we at the State Department and the Administration remain hopeful that at some point in the future the Senate will ratify that treaty so that we can become a party in that as well. Thank you. Update, Aug. 31, 12:05 p.m. | I moved the update that was here to a new post on how the public tends to focus on political and entertainment angles[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/amid-attacks-over-mountain-names-and-arctic-oil-leases-obama-seeks-alaska-survival-tips-from-bear-grylls/]."
Melting Ice Isn’t Opening Arctic to Oil Bonanza,Norway,"TERIBERKA, Russia — The warming Arctic[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/arctic_regions/index.html?inline=nyt-geo] should already have transformed this impoverished fishing village on the coast of the Barents Sea. The Kremlin spent billions in the last decade in hopes of turning it into a northern hub of its global energy powerhouse, Gazprom. It was once the most ambitious project planned in the Arctic Ocean, but now there is little to show for it aside from a shuttered headquarters and an enormous gravel road carved out of the windblown coastline like a scar. “There are plans,” said Viktor A. Turchaninov, the village’s mayor, “but the facts — the realities of life — suggest the opposite.” The dream of an Arctic Klondike, made possible by the rapid warming of once-icebound waters, has been at the core of Russia’s national ambitions[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/business/global/16arctic.html] and those of the world’s biggest energy companies for more than a decade. But even as Royal Dutch Shell began drilling an exploratory well[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/us/way-cleared-for-shell-to-start-drilling-in-arctic-ocean.html] this summer off the north coast of Alaska, Russia[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/russiaandtheformersovietunion/index.html?inline=nyt-geo]’s experiences here have become a cautionary tale, one that illustrates the challenges facing those imagining that a changing Arctic will produce oil[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier] and gas riches. Tectonic shifts in the global energy economy, fierce opposition from environmentalists who oppose tampering with the ecologically fragile waters, and formidable logistical obstacles have tempered enthusiasm that only a few years ago seemed boundless. After years of planning and delays, Shell’s drilling project in the stormy waters of the Chukchi Sea is now being watched by the industry, officials, residents and critics as a make-or-break test of the viability of production in the Arctic. “From an economic point of view, I’m not sure going offshore Arctic is very rational,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive and president of Total, the French oil company, which once also planned to drill off Alaska’s northern coast. Shell has already spent $7 billion and this summer has faced tribulations like those that marred an ill-fated exploration three years ago, including dogged protests, harsh weather and an accident in July that gouged a hole in one of its ships after it struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutian Islands. Only seven years ago, Shell and other companies — ConocoPhillips, Statoil of Norway, Repsol of Spain and Eni of Italy — together paid $2.7 billion for leases for the fields off Alaska[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/business/07oil.html]. The price of oil at the time climbed to nearly $150 a barrel, and the accelerated reduction of ice that once choked the Arctic Ocean seemed to make exploration easier. Then the market changed. The world today is awash in oil and natural gas[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/natural-gas/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], largely because of the shale revolution in the United States and the advent of hydraulic fracturing[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/natural-gas/index.html?8a], which has so increased production that the United States has slashed imports. Saudi Arabia and other states around the Persian Gulf are producing at maximum levels, and if the nuclear agreement with Iran [http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-is-reached-after-long-negotiations.html]gets final approval and economic sanctions are lifted, Iran’s reserves could soon flood the market. In the last year alone, the price of oil has plummeted to less than $50 a barrel. Across the Arctic, from Russia to Norway to Canada, offshore projects have already proved disappointing. After drilling eight exploratory wells off Greenland in 2011 and 2012, Cairn Energy, a Scottish company, abandoned them. Chevron shelved exploration[http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/12/17/business/17reuters-chevron-canada-artic.html] in the Canadian waters of the Beaufort Sea last December, followed in June by a consortium including ExxonMobil and BP. American sanctions[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/business/energy-environment/new-sanctions-to-stall-exxons-arctic-oil-plans.html] imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea last year forced ExxonMobil to withdraw from a joint venture in the Kara Sea with the state-owned oil giant Rosneft, which has had to suspend its drilling plans there as it searches for new partners. “When we look at Arctic opportunities, they are always the opportunities that are 10 years away,” said Kenneth B. Medlock III, director of the Center for Energy Studies[http://bakerinstitute.org/center-for-energy-studies/] at Rice University. The difficulties of getting oil and gas out of the Arctic are daunting. Winters are long and dark, and the Arctic seas, despite reductions in the permanent ice pack[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/science/earth/arctic-sea-ice-stops-melting-but-new-record-low-is-set.html], are still clogged with floes and icebergs, while intensifying storms have threatened ships or oil rigs even during the summer. Marshy tundra onshore complicates the construction of pipelines and support facilities. So do coastal erosion and melting permafrost. There are few roads or airports, or people for that matter, near the areas to be drilled, requiring workers and equipment to be shipped long distances. Despite agreements by the Arctic Council[http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/], an international organization that includes the United States, Russia and six other Arctic countries, few resources are available for search and rescue or the cleanup of oil in icy conditions. That, along with strict requirements imposed by the Obama administration, forced Shell to send a flotilla of more than two dozen ships to the Chukchi Sea this summer. “The entire cost structure up there is three to five times more expensive than onshore lower 48,” said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a Texas-based oil company. Two years ago, his company gave up on a field projected to contain 100 million barrels of oil in the Beaufort Sea — drilled from a man-made island and connected by an eight-mile pipeline to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska — in order to invest more in Texas shale fields. “One-hundred-million-barrel-type discoveries will not be economical in a $100-a-barrel oil environment, and they certainly won’t be economical today,” Mr. Sheffield said. Even optimistic projections suggest the Arctic might not prove to be as transformative as once imagined. According to Rystad Energy, a global consultancy based in Norway, production from offshore fields in or near the Arctic could double between 2015 and 2025 to 1.4 million barrels a day, which would still be less than 2 percent of current global production. “When people say the Arctic is the next frontier and there is great resource potential, of course there is the risk that it is hype,” said Jon Marsh Duesund, a Rystad senior project manager. High Hopes in Disrepair Teriberka, a village of 1,000 people on the Barents Sea, is where Gazprom’s offshore ambitions collided with the harsh realities of the Arctic. It was a thriving fishing village in Soviet times, with fish-processing factories and even a farm for harvesting the pelts of snow foxes, but it fell into decline in the 1970s with the advent of industrial fishing. The population dropped from more than 6,000; wooden piers crumbled; and fishing boats that once brought back cod were scuttled in the bay where the Teriberka River flows into the sea. Like people in Alaska and other places who look to the changing Arctic for economic development and jobs, the village’s residents welcomed Gazprom’s plans to tap an enormous gas field, called the Shtokman, that was discovered in 1988 about 370 miles offshore. Under the control of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Gazprom emerged as an energy giant controlled by the state, and for much of the 2000s, the Shtokman was its biggest prize, a project that Russia dangled before eager foreign investors. After reaching deals with Total and Statoil, Gazprom began construction of the road in Teriberka where it hoped to build terminals for processing and shipping the gas in liquefied form — all at a cost estimated to rise to $20 billion. After years of work, however, Russia’s plans for the project came under pressure from enormous technical challenges, the changing energy market and finally the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Russia, as the world’s largest producer of natural gas, found itself struggling to compete against alternative supplies to countries in Europe eager to reduce their dependence on Mr. Putin’s government, even as prices dropped significantly. “Monopolies do not have strategic vision,” said Vladimir Chuprov, an energy expert for Greenpeace Russia[http://www.greenpeace.org/russia/en/] who opposes offshore exploration in the Arctic. “The decisions are very political, and the economic background is not a factor.” Statoil pulled out in 2012, writing off more than $335 million in costs. Total wrote off $350 million last year and, according to Russian news accounts, returned its 25 percent share of the project to Gazprom in June. The Arctic is at the core of the nationalist ambitions of Mr. Putin, who once said that tapping the region’s resources was as natural as hunting and harvesting berries and mushrooms. Russia already operates the first offshore production platform above the Arctic Circle, called Prirazlomnoye[http://www.gazprom-neft.com/company/business/exploration-and-production/new-projects/prirazlomnoe/], which began pumping the first commercial shipments from the Kara Sea in late 2013 and reached a modest two million barrels last year. The figures, however, are a fraction of the more accessible gas and oil reserves onshore, including the Yamal Peninsula in northern Siberia 900 miles east. Plans for more offshore projects have stalled, and Russia has shifted its focus onshore, especially following American sanctions that targeted offshore Arctic projects. The Shtokman field, Mr. Putin has boasted, remains a prospect, but one for the next generation. “As soon as they speak of the next generation, it means something is wrong,” Mr. Chuprov, of Greenpeace Russia, said. “In this country — in Soviet times, in czarist times — nobody thinks about the next generation.” Despite Gazprom’s promises to resume drilling — in 2014, then in 2016 or 2019 — residents in Teriberka have become resigned about the boom that never was. The contractors who arrived in droves have departed, and the enormous embankment where Gazprom built a gravel road, encroaching on the village’s cemetery, comes to a dead end at a rocky cliff. Teriberka is better known now as the location of the Oscar-nominated “Leviathan[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/world/europe/leviathan-arussian-movie-gets-applause-in-hollywood-but-scorn-at-home.html],” a bleak film that depicts one man’s struggle against a venal bureaucrat who wants to seize his beloved house on the bay. “They built the road,” Igor Abanosimov said when a neighbor lamented that the project had changed little. Mr. Abanosimov owns a series of floating cottages that he rents out, dreaming, perhaps improbably, of developing a yacht club and other amenities that might attract tourists instead of energy companies. The Arctic, he said, had its own soul. “Those it wants to accept, it accepts,” he explained. “Those it wants to banish, it banishes.” Shell’s Many Mishaps In late August, a ferocious storm[http://www.adn.com/article/20150827/high-winds-cause-flooding-barrow-prompt-shell-pause-oil-drilling] whipping through the Chukchi Sea forced Shell to suspend its drilling operations only a month after one of its two floating rigs drove a drill bit into the seafloor. The company resumed operations after the weather cleared. It was just the latest distraction in Shell’s long effort to tap one of the last remaining untouched giant oil reserves. Three years ago, the company came close to reaching oil, but its plans for two exploratory wells in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas died after a series of bizarre accidents. One of the two drill ships, the Noble Discoverer, nearly ran aground on a sandy beach in the Aleutians. An Arctic containment dome was crushed during a vital test. And a tow line on the second drill ship, the Kulluk, snapped, setting it adrift on the high seas[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/magazine/the-wreck-of-the-kulluk.html]. To environmentalists, the accidents bolstered their arguments that exploration in the Arctic is simply too risky. Shell did not give up, though. The company replaced its senior Arctic leadership team and devised another plan to overcome the natural and regulatory hurdles. And still it has struggled. A private Finnish icebreaker it contracted, the Fennica, struck an uncharted shoal in the Aleutians in July. With no adequate facilities in Alaska, the Fennica had to go to Portland, Ore[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/13/us/ap-us-arctic-offshore-drilling.html].[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/13/us/ap-us-arctic-offshore-drilling.html], for repairs. When the ship tried to head back north, protesters tried to block the vessel[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/30/us/ap-us-arctic-offshore-drilling.html] with kayaks and then suspended themselves from a bridge over the Willamette River, obstructing safe passage. A court then threatened Greenpeace with fines of $2,500 an hour if the protesters did not clear the way. The Obama administration has set strict limits on how Shell can operate. It prohibited the company from simultaneously drilling two wells, as planned. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service[http://www.fws.gov/] ruled that marine wildlife protections required a 15-mile buffer zone between simultaneous drillings, while the company had planned for a nine-mile buffer. Workers on Shell’s ships also have to keep watch and avoid crossing the migratory paths of whales and other marine mammals. “Most of the natives up here in the north are concerned with the marine mammals,” said James Pakotak, a resident of Barrow, Alaska, where the airport serves as a hub for many of Shell’s workers. The storms that battered Shell’s flotilla also hammered the town. “What if there’s an oil spill[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/gulf_of_mexico_2010/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]?

They cite efforts to drill there in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as a study[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3049/fs2008-3049.pdf] by the United States Geological Survey in 2008 that estimated that 13 percent of the world’s untapped oil and 30 percent of its natural gas lay in the Arctic. The National Petroleum Council, in a report[http://www.npcarcticpotentialreport.org/] commissioned by the Department of Energy and released this year, said the technology and expertise already existed to extract oil and natural gas safely in icy conditions, replacing declining supplies on Alaska’s North Slope. Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, said in a conference call last month that the company’s stake could ultimately be “multiple times” more bountiful than in the vast Gulf of Mexico. “Alaska is a long-term play,” he said. “That is the way you have to look at it.

""Moving forward, headline inflation is expected to peak in early 2016 and it will moderate for the remainder of the year.""

Russia-Owned Sanctioned Shipyard Hopes for Icebreaker Zeal in Arctic,Norway,"HELSINKI - On a sunny day on the Helsinki seafront, sparks fly from steel welding at the bustling Arctech shipyard, which seems insulated from Finland's economic recession as it strives to meet an order book that stretches into 2017. The world's biggest manufacturer of icebreakers, or ships that can navigate ice-covered waters, Arctech is poised to benefit from an expected flurry of activity in the Arctic, which is being reinforced by U.S. President Barack Obama's Arctic push. As climate change is melting sea ice and opening the Arctic to more shipping, mining and oil drilling, icebreakers will forge waterways for other ships, carry out rescue missions and do stand-by duties for oil platforms in the region. ""We are getting inquiries from several countries who have Arctic regions, or companies from such countries,"" said Esko Mustamaki, Arctech's managing director, sitting in his office at the vast shipyard as workers nearby still wearing helmets cycle off for lunch breaks on the compound. The yard is currently building six vessels, four for Russian state-owned shipping company Sovcomflot and one each for the Russian and Finnish transport ministries. One will be for Arctic use and Mustamaki expects demand to grow. ""It is very possible that in the coming decades, there will be a lot of activity in the [Arctic] region,"" Mustamaki said. That should be good for business, but there is a cloud on the horizon: The yard is now owned by Russia's state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC), which was added to a list of U.S. sanctions against Russia last year in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine. The shipyard was once owned by Norwegian companies Kvaerner and Aker Yards, and later by Korea's STX, whose financial problems eventually prompted the deal with Russia, completed last year. So far Arctech has weathered the impact of sanctions but they are making business more difficult. Nordea, the Nordic region's biggest bank, closed Arctech's account last year due to U.S. sanctions. Mustamaki said the shipyard has opened new bank accounts, declining to name the banks. But accessing finance now takes more time. ""Banks have compliance rules that require more checks for us now, so anything where we need banks takes time. But so far, it hasn't affected our order intake,"" Mustamaki said. ""That could happen if a client would not want to do business with us for that reason."" Shipping sources have said that U.S. and EU sanctions against the company's Russian clients could complicate their orders in the future. As the Arctic opens to tourism and oil drilling and spurs more maritime traffic, the United States lags Russia's resources in the region and President Obama said this month that it needs to quickly acquire at least one new icebreaker. While Russia has 40 icebreakers and another 11 planned or under construction, the U.S. Coast Guard has three, only one of which is a heavy duty vessel, the White House has said. For Arctech, sanctions alone would rule out any business with the U.S. government, putting potentially some of the industry's most lucrative contracts in the next few years out of reach. Mustamaki, however, is sanguine, arguing that even without sanctions, his company probably wouldn't win any U.S. orders because the U.S. Jones Act requires that basically all American vessels must be built in local shipyards - a law that he says will force the United States to pay sky-high prices for icebreakers. A Congressional research service report has put the cost of a new U.S. icebreaker at about $1 billion. ""That sounds like quite a lot. We are currently building an icebreaker for the state of Finland for 123 million euros [$139 million],"" said Mustamaki. The Helsinki yard, founded in 1865 and renamed Arctech in 2010, has built 60 percent of all icebreakers operating in the world - most used by Russia, including for offshore energy production. While standard shipbuilding has largely moved to Asia, Arctech is one of a few niche shipyards left in Europe. Its competitors include Germany's Nordic Yards, Norway's Vard and the Netherlands-based Damen. The Finnish company is currently building more energy-efficient ships able to operate in minus 35 degrees Celsius and navigate through 1.5 meters of ice. Its icebreaker under construction for the Finnish transport ministry will be the world's first to use liquefied natural gas as fuel, rather than relying on more polluting diesel. ""There are lots of details but no concrete list for building an Arctic vessel, it's more about tacit knowledge,"" Mustamaki said."

""Bank Finance and Credit took liabilities to support the bank's liquidity thanks to sale of non-profile assets of the shareholder and observe the level of mandatory reserves and other requirements… When the shareholder did not fulfill its liabilities, we reacted quickly. Today, the bank was declared insolvent and transferred to the fund [the Individuals' Deposit Guarantee Fund],"" reads the report, citing NBU Governor Valeriya Gontareva. NBU said that 93.2% (234,000 people) of all depositors in the bank would receive their deposits in full, as their deposits do not exceed the sum guaranteed by the Deposit Guarantee Fund of UAH 200,000. Gontareva said that NBU had been working on the financial readjustment program both with top managers of the bank and its majority shareholder – Zhevaho. She said that the bank had problems for seven months, and during the whole period the shareholder observed all the recommendations of the NBU. However, these measures was not enough, and the shareholder failed to fulfill its written liabilities to support liquidity and requirements in the agreed terms, in particular, for reserves, regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity, the regulator said. ""When it was time to pay debts and sell assets, the shareholder did not do this in the proposed term. I want to say that this bank is not systemic, and placing it to the category of insolvent banks brings no threat to stability of the country's banking sector,"" Gontareva said. She said that a lion's share of the bank's assets was linked to crediting of business of the majority shareholder. Bank Finance and Credit was founded in 1990. The ultimate beneficiary of the bank is Ukrainian businessman and MP Kostiantyn Zhevaho, a majority shareholder and CEO in Ferrexpo, a major iron ore pellet producer and exporter.

NBU had to declare Bank National Investment insolvent when facts of non-reflecting documents of clients which were not settled in the term set in Ukraine law in the bank's accounting documents were established. ""NBU monitors transactions of banks with non-transparent structure of ownership.

On the Nordic Trail in Scotland,Norway,"“Sving til venstre.” Jurgen issued instructions in his pleasingly Nordic voice, firm but encouraging. From behind the wheel, David nodded his head, and turned the car to the left. We were only a mile outside Edinburgh[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/scotland/edinburgh/overview.html?inline=nyt-geo], but thanks to David, my Norwegian-American boyfriend, and Jurgen, the Norwegian speaker on David’s GPS, I already felt deep into Viking territory. Scotland[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/scotland/overview.html?inline=nyt-geo] is perhaps not the most obvious place to look for traces of Nordic culture. But in the months leading up to the nation’s vote on independence from England last September, there was talk of it everywhere. Although it had been six centuries since any part of Scotland was in Norse hands, many nationalists were suggesting that Viking heritage formed part of the separate identity that lay behind an independence bid, which, although it failed at the polls, has grown stronger since the referendum. And it wasn’t all historic either: The Scottish Nationalist Party assured voters that Scotland’s similarities to its Scandinavian neighbors — its small size, its environmental awareness and its Norwegian-style oil reserves — would guarantee prosperity. And perhaps even justify membership in the Nordic Council, an intergovernmental body that fosters political, economic and cultural cooperation among the five Nordic nations and three autonomous regions. As a recent transplant to Denmark, I was still trying to figure out Scandinavian identity myself, so this claim intrigued me. What did it take, besides a penchant for bicycles, brooding television series and salted licorice, to become Nordic? To find out, David and I would start in the capital, then drive as far into Scotland’s formerly Viking lands as we could. We began at the National Museum of Scotland[http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland] in Edinburgh. The first Viking invasions into the British Isles were recorded in the late eighth century; monks’ chronicles make frequent, terrified references to northerly marauders who raped and pillaged their way through the Highlands. But at the museum, the image of those rampaging Norsemen was changing: Not only were they not all raiding, bloodthirsty warriors, but they also weren’t even all men. Tools, jewelry and a reconstructed burial site on display all testified to the gentler side of Viking life, and proved that the Norse (male and female) set down roots in Scotland, engaging in agriculture, trade and family life. “Relations with local people,” read the optimistic text on one case, “weren’t always hostile.” On that day last August, they were rather the opposite. Near a barbershop full of men whose lumberjack beards marked them as either Scandinavian or Brooklynite, we found Timberyard[http://www.timberyard.co/]. With its rough wooden floors and jars of fermenting vegetables on display, the restaurant would have fit as easily onto a lonely, windswept expanse of the Stockholm peninsula as it did in the Scottish capital. The food, too, was identifiably Nordic, from the chewy sourdough served with house-made butter and lovage salt that started the meal, to the foraged woodruff tea that ended it. In between came delicate dishes strewn with local herbs and flowers: nearly raw scallops shaved thin and adorned with wild garlic petals; mackerel grilled so that the char cut through the fish’s oiliness, served with yogurt and juicy nasturtium leaves. “It’s hard not to be influenced by it,” Ben Radford, the chef, said of the northerly elements in what he calls his “modern Scottish” cuisine. “Culturally, we’re very similar. And we’re working with the same ingredients, letting them shine through, so that each flavor is apparent, crisp and clean.” In Glasgow, two recent graduates take the affinity even further. Through their consulting firm Lateral North, Graham Hogg and Alex Hobday help towns in the upper reaches of Scotland develop their Nordic potential as transportation and green energy hubs. “We have the same climate, the same landscape, even the same dark sense of humor, so we can take the Nordic countries as a model for economic development,” Mr. Hogg said. “We’re trying to get people to think of Scotland not as the end of Europe, but as the gateway to the North.” It was time to head toward that gate. There are a number of Viking-related spots in the Western Highlands. But Mr. Hogg had said we would find the most striking examples of Scandinavian-style Scotland in Orkney and Shetland, so we fired up the GPS and headed north. “Rett frem,” Jurgen said, directing us straight ahead with what I interpreted as approval. Several hours later, Norway appeared on the horizon. In truth, it wasn’t really Norway, just a series of Nordic-style houses — pointy, clean-lined and painted in bright, saturated colors that stood out against the churning North Sea — that wouldn’t have been out of place in Bergen. We had reached John O’Groats, the purportedly northernmost (there is some contention) point of mainland Scotland. It consists of little more than a few souvenir shops and a parking lot big enough for all those tour buses to turn around in. But Natural Retreats, a hotel development company, has made the place much more appealing by taking a Gothic-style inn and adding several Nordic-style wooden houses onto the side. Each building is called a toft, a Norse-derived word for farmhouse or homestead. The tofts are painted different colors and contain apartments, which comprise the accommodations. The rooms are spare and tasteful, with the streaming light and clean lines that are the hallmarks of Scandinavian design. “It’s quite straightforward,” said Adam Gough, Natural Retreats[https://www.naturalretreats.com/uk/destinations/scotland/john-ogroats]’ head of technical services, when asked about Nordic style. “There is a lot of history and strong links with Scandinavia.” But neither Scandi chic, nor the newer, kinder version of the Vikings had made it to the nearby town of Wick, which gets its name from the Old Norse word for bay. Asked why the hotel where she worked was called the Norseman, the receptionist admitted that she wasn’t sure. “Because they came here raping and rampaging through the hills?” she asked. “You know, doing Viking things.” It wasn’t hard to see why she persisted in that image. Wick[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_059], which Robert Louis Stevenson once referred to as “the meanest of mean towns,” has little in the way of tourist attractions except for a ruined castle that was probably built in the 12th century, presumably by the Norse earl, Harald Maddadson. One of the oldest and best preserved in Scotland, the castle’s tower still reaches four stories up, and its defensive ditches and perilous cliffs keep it cut off from the mainland. It is a stirring place, desolate and imposing, and not at all hard to imagine as the kind of stronghold from which one might have set out marauding. Did people in this part of Scotland feel Viking? As we stood on the ferry to the Orkney Islands[http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/britain/scotland/orkney-islands/overview.html?inline=nyt-geo], watching mainland Britain disappear, we pondered the question. “What I can’t tell,” David said, “is whether they actually identify with their Nordic past, or if it’s just a marketing ploy.” We had our first answer of a sort after landing at St. Margaret’s Hope, a pretty, stone-clad town that was a welcoming entry to Orkney’s main island. Rebooting Jurgen after his stay in the ship’s hold, we drove to Highland Park distillery in the market town of Kirkwall, the Orcadian capital. The northernmost whiskey distillery in Britain (there would be many claims to the northernmost on this trip), Highland Park makes a line of high-end Scotch whiskies named after Vikings real and imagined: Eibar, Thor, Loki. “We’re steeped in Viking history, with all its fantastic stories, and if you have a story you can sell more,” said Patricia Retson, Highland Park’s brand heritage manager, after we had toured the distillery’s dankly atmospheric cellar and sleek tasting room. “But we’re also trying to make a real connection, and if it’s going to work, it has to be authentic.” To that end, the distillery’s Loki gets its mischievousness from an aroma that is all sweet apples, but turns to smoke and wood on the palate. Its Leif Erikssonis aged in 100 percent American oak barrels. Yet in downtown Kirkwall, where the Romanesque cathedral, built of sandstone, houses the relics of St. Magnus Erlendsson, the Norse-descended Earl of Orkney who was martyred after an unsuccessful battle with a rival chieftain in the early 12th century, and where miniature Viking ships still cap the post office lintel, Donna Heddle had no doubt the connection went considerably deeper than mere marketing. As the director of the Center for Nordic Studies, Dr. Heddle sees evidence of Norseness almost everywhere: in the Orkney dialect that puts its prepositions at the end of sentences; in a concept of social justice that emphasizes egalitarianism and spurns status or rank; in the fact, she said, that 66 percent of Orcadians’ DNA is Norwegian. And just as the Nordic presence helps explain the separate sense of identity that Scots feel from the English, so too does it explain the separate identity that Orcadians feel from mainland Scots. “Vikings are very sexy now,” she said. “But for us it’s more than that. You can see it in our knitting patterns and our sailing skills and in the can-do attitude. This is a living legacy.” Living, but also dead. After Kirkwall, we drove across windswept hills and muddy farmlands, before arriving at Orphir and the archaeological remains of Earl’s Bu[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertydetail.htm?PropID=PL_116]. According to the medieval Orkneyinga saga, the nearly 1,000-year-old site was home not only to a round church built by Magnus’s murderous cousin Hakon, but also to a grand drinking hall, or bu. Like most Viking drinking halls, it was the scene of quite a lot of violence (proximity to a church came in handy; the brawlers could slip next door to repent of their drunken behavior, and, consciences cleansed, get back to guzzling mead). Maybe it was the film in the modest visitor center that recounted how one drunken slight had unleashed a massacre at the hall, or perhaps we had watched too much of “Game of Thrones,” but as David and I walked about the lonely ruins of the stone church (a third of its curved walls still standing), I suddenly found myself charging him with an imaginary battle ax. After a brief but virtual bloody fight, we collapsed on the grass in giggles. All that Viking history will do that to you. There are similar archaeological sites all over Orkney, so we had plenty of opportunities to perfect our re-enactment skills. At Maeshowe[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_205&PropName;=Maeshowe%20Chambered%20Cairn], a grass-covered mound that encases a Neolithic tomb marked up with 12th-century Norse Runes, the sheep that stood between us and the burial chamber fell to our raiding swords. At the Brough of Birsay[http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyoverview.htm?PropID=PL_042], accessible only by foot during the few hours when the tides recede, we sweated in the chamber marked the Viking sauna. But there was no fantasy involved at the nearby Barony Mill, where Brian Johnston, the miller, grinds bere, a landrace barley, with a flavor more pronounced than wheat. “Many people think the Vikings brought it here,” Mr. Johnston said as he showed us around the 19th-century mill, which is powered by a water wheel. “And the only other place it grows is in Norway.” There would be more culinary connections on the Shetland Islands. We landed early in the morning on the main island after an overnight ferry. Waiting for a cafe to open, we prowled the industrial-looking buildings and still-closed sweater shops in Lerwick, the capital and Shetland’s only real town. Once suitably caffeinated, we returned to Jurgen and headed south. Shetland is almost entirely treeless, with a terrain that veers mainly between the barren and the bleak, but is adorably dotted with the tiny ponies that take their name from the place. Rocky soil and near constant wind explain why the local diet is almost entirely lacking in fresh fruit and vegetables. But even that lack can only partly explain the peculiar dish known as reestit mutton. “No, you wouldn’t expect to find this in a restaurant,” said Marian Armitage, the author of “Shetland Food and Cooking,” as she sawed off a few rocklike chunks of a fossilized slab of meat in her kitchen, where we had come to learn about the local cuisine. “Unless they were trying to do something quirky.” Through the windows of her enclosed porch, I could just make out the ruined walls of Jarlshof, another Norse settlement, in the distance. Ms. Armitage fried a bit of the mutton in a pan, and explained the process for making it: Raw meat was salted in brine, then hung from the rafters of the house, preferably over a peat fire, so that the smoke seasoned the meat. I put a bite in my mouth: Quirky was definitely one word for it. The mutton was fatty, salty and tasted, well, rotten. “Just what you want,” David said, “after a long day at sea.” Still, I was thrilled to eat it. A couple of years earlier, I had tried something similar in the Faroe Islands, an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean, about halfway between Norway and Iceland, where they make raest, which is raw mutton hung to air-dry in open huts for months, without the benefit of smoke or salt. Surely, I asked Armitage, raest and reestit were versions of the same dish, and evidence of a Nordic connection? “Ah no,” she said. “For that you’d be wanting vivda.” It turns out that Shetlanders once ate the exact same preparation — and called it by the Norse word for leg meat— until salt became more widespread in the islands. After lunch, we turned around (“Snu rundt,” Jurgen said) and headed back north. We passed helpful signs that translated the islands’ Old Norse geographic names into English (“Tingwall, Field of the Parliament”) and stopped, incongruously enough, at a fjord-side food truck for pulled pork sandwiches. It required two more ferries, but we finally arrived in Unst, the northernmost of the Shetland Islands, and hence, the northernmost in Scotland. Unst has a higher density of rural Viking sites than any place else in the world, including Scandinavia, with 60 longhouses on a 46-square-mile island. For our first stop, at Hamar, we skirted some curious sheep and a watchful bull to walk among the low, grass-carpeted walls of one (David was saved from another re-enacted vanquishing only because the preponderance of dung at our feet made things especially messy.) From what would have been the front door, I gazed down the length of the shimmering fjord, before I looked down to find the fragments of a broken beer bottle. The idea that local teenagers might use this ancient home as a hangout for drinking, flirting and communing with their Viking past pleased me. But at the Skidbladner, a reconstructed Viking ship up the road, the volunteer who showed visitors around had a much more prosaic explanation for how past and present came together: economic necessity. Clad in a woolen dress fastened with brooches that approximated what a Viking woman would have worn once she was back on dry land, the volunteer divided her time between welcoming visitors to the site and doing a bit of nalebinding, a Nordic form of needlework that predates knitting. As she showed us around the Skidbladner, a full-size replica of a ship found in a Norwegian Viking burial mound in the 19th century, she told us about the Royal Air Force base that once formed the basis of Unst’s economy. “But they shut that down some years back, and that left a terrible hole,” she said. “Viking tourism is meant to fill it.” We were back to the same question, with little of Scottish territory left. Luckily, just as we neared Shetland’s northern edge, we spied Valhalla. It looked more like a warehouse than the Norse god Odin’s grand hall for fallen warriors, but that may have been because on Unst at least, Valhalla is a craft brewery. The name wasn’t the founder Sonny Priest’s idea. “The Viking thing has been done to death, so I was dead against it,” he said, but more prescient minds on the regional council prevailed. These days, Mr. Priest sells his Old Scatness (named after a Shetland Viking settlement) and Simmer Din (from the Shetland phrase for summer’s long twilight) ales as far as Glasgow and Oslo. He wasn’t sure what to make of his ancestors’ past. “When I was a kid, the ties to the Norse felt stronger,” he said as he stopped to stick his nose in a bag of hops. “There were all these words we used, and the whalers would take our men because they knew our seafaring skills went back to them. Now sometimes I think it’s just for the tourists. But everybody in Shetland is still proud of their Viking heritage.” In the end, neither its Viking past nor its imagined Nordic future would be strong enough to sever Scotland from England. But at our final stop, David and I could see why it came close. After hiking through the heather at Saxa Vord, we arrived at the northernmost cliff on Shetland’s most northerly inhabited island. To the east, some 200 miles in the distance, was Norway; to the north, past the rocky outcrop of Muckle Flugga, was the Arctic. We watched the sun set, then got back in the car. “Reisen slutt,” Jurgen said. It was, as he said, journey’s end.

FTSE CLOSE: Footsie drops as US stocks post sharp opening falls on caution ahead of Yellen speech,Norway,"17.25: The FTSE 100 closed down 70.75 points at 5961.49 as nerves set in ahead of a keenly awaited speech by Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen. Investors will be listening out for clues to her stance on the timing of a US interest rate rise, after markets were surprised by a no-change decision at this month's Fed meeting. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both shed 2 per cent of their value today, while the US Dow Jones fell 178.21 to 16,101.68 in early trading. 'Fears over global growth are once again rattling equity markets and this has resulted in another day of losses for the FTSE100,' said Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct. 'Some well-worn mining stocks are carrying the worst of the downside with Glencore off by another 9 per cent as we run into the close but news that Caterpillar in the US is planning layoffs is the sort of data point that is setting the tone with regard to what this means for global consumption. 'Read across is perhaps most notably hitting Rolls Royce which is off around 5 per cent despite having been selected to supply £25million worth of kit for the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point, and that bumper performance we saw from IAG yesterday – again a barometer for the global economy – is being called into question, too. 'If we need any confirmation of the scale of the uncertainty that’s facing markets right now, it has to be the fact that precious metals specialists Randgold and Fresnillo are both charging to the top of the FTSE leaderboard. Gold prices have soared off the back of the worsening situation.' Sharply lower oil prices sent heavily weighted BP and Royal Dutch Shell into the red. BP dropped 2 per cent or 6.6p to 322.9p, while Shell was 36p lower at 1539.5p. Sainsbury's was also lower ahead of its trading update next week, with shares hit by a downbeat broker note from HSBC which cut profit forecasts for the chain. Shares fell 5p at 223.7p. Engineer Smiths Group was another faller, giving back some of the gains seen on Wednesday after full-year results showed higher profits but falling sales. Shares fell 64p at 975p. Lloyds Banking Group was one of the biggest blue chip risers after reports that a leading fund manager expects the lender to become a big dividend payer within two years. Shares in the bank rose 0.89p at 73.8p. High street retailer Next was also among the top gainers, ahead 40p to 7535p after a price upgrade from broker Nomura. In the FTSE 250, Thomas Cook climbed almost 3 per cent or 3.1p to 119p after saying it made good progress over the summer despite 'external shocks' including the deadly terror attack in Tunisia. With the North African country effectively shut down to tourists, it saw a surge in bookings to Greece and Egypt. Long-haul and own-brand sales were also doing well. Rival TUI had enjoyed a bounce after the Thomas Cook cheer, but later lost gains due to the wider market falls, down 29p to 1179p. Discount retailer Poundland was a big faller on the FTSE 250 after warning over half-year profits as it also revealed takeover target 99p Stores was in weaker financial health than previously thought. The news emerged as Poundland announced details of a £50million share placing to fund the £55million takeover. Shares fell more than 13 per cent or 41.6p to 268p. The pound was higher against the US dollar, at just under $1.53, as jittery traders waited to hear Yellen's speech tonight. Sterling was a cent lower against the euro at just over €1.35. The biggest risers in the FTSE 100 were Randgold Resources up 206p at 3946p, Fresnillo up 20.5p at 621p, Imperial Tobacco up 66p at 3465p and Lloyds Banking Group up 0.89p at 73.8p. The biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 were Glencore down 10.5p at 98.6p, Smiths Group down 64p at 975p, Anglo American down 33.5p at 624.6p and Rolls-Royce down 29p at 650.5p. 17.01: The FTSE 100 closed down 70.75 points at 5961.49. More to come. 15:00: The Footsie sunk over 1 per cent to session lows in late afternoon trade as US stocks also started with big falls with investors nervously awaiting a speech tonight from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, the first since the US central bank left interest rates on hold last week. With an hour and a half of trading to go in London, the FTSE 100 index was down 62.1 points, or 1 per cent at 5,970.1, just off the session low of 5,959.90, having reversed from the day’s peak of 6,055.64. In early trade on Wall Street, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 203.1 points to 16,076.8, while the broader S&P; 500 index shed 21.5 points to 1,917.3, and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite lost 56.1 points at 4,696.6. Investors were cautious with Yellen to deliver a lecture on inflation dynamics and monetary policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst at 10pm London time. Investors will be searching for any comments about last week’s Fed policy meeting and the decision to leave interest rates on hold. Today’s US data was mostly upbeat, with new homes sales at 552,000 in August, the highest level since early 2008, and well above forecast for sales of 515,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. Sales for July were also revised up to a 522,000 rate, from an initial forecast of 507,000. As the Fed winds up to a US interest rate hike, Norway’s central bank today cut its key interest rate to 0.75 per cent from 1,00 per cent, with officials saying lower oil prices are taking a toll on the economy, and that rates may need to move lower still. European markets were also under pressure as the escalating Volkswagen emissions scandal dragged on carmakers, with France’s CAC 40 index losing 1.7 per cent, while Germany’s Dax 30 index dropping 1.8 per cent. 14.00: The Footsie held near session lows in early afternoon trade, with some mixed US data adding to expectations for opening falls on Wall Street as investors await a speech tonight from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, the first since the US central bank left interest rates on hold last week. With half an hour to go until Wall Street’s open, the FTSE 100 index was down 41.2 points, or 0.7 per cent at 5,991.0, just above the session low of 5,982.85, having dropped from the day’s peak of 6,055.64. European markets were under even more pressure, with France’s CAC 40 index losing 1.7 per cent, while Germany’s Dax 30 index dropped 1.8 per cent amid the escalating Volkswagen emissions scandal. Autos peer BMW dropped 9 per cent after a German magazine said some of its diesel cars were found to exceed emissions standards. US stock futures extended their earlier falls, now signalling a 150 point drop by the Dow Jones Industrial Average on caution ahead of the Yellen speech and after some mixed data. US initial jobless claims inched up by just 3,000 to 267,000 in the week ended September 19, less than the 275,000 forecast, with claims having fallen by 17,000 in the previous two weeks. The average of new claims over the past month, meanwhile, edged down by 750 to a seasonally adjusted 271,750, the lowest level in a month. Meanwhile US durable orders fell a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent in August, in line with the drop forecast by economists. Minus transportation, orders were flat, the Commerce Department said. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: ‘Today’s weak durable goods figures are perhaps a sign that Fed chair Janet Yellen was right to sit on her hands with regard to the interest rate rise. ‘Though it’s no fault of her own, the air of anticipation and uncertainty of when the increase will happen is keeping investors guessing, much of the reason for the underwhelming figures. ‘However, it will be interesting to see how the furore around German autos this week affects the US durable goods data in the coming months. Yellen will now be hoping to see positive GDP results on Friday to keep her ambition to raise rates on track.’ 12.30: The Footsie sunk lower at lunchtime, reversing a modest mid morning rally, on expectations for opening falls on Wall Street as investors turn cautious ahead of a keynote speech from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, the first since the US central bank left interest rates on hold last week. By mid session, the FTSE 100 index was down 40.2 points, or 0.7 per cent at 5,999.92, just above the session low of 5,982.85, having dropped from the day’s peak of 6,055.64 as this week’s volatile performances continue. European markets fell even further back, with France’s CAC 40 index losing 1.6 per cent, while Germany’s Dax 30 index dropped 2.0 per cent with the escalating Volkswagen emissions scandal returning to the fore after the group admitted its cars were also affected across Europe. David Madden, market analyst at IG said: ‘Ever since Black Monday dealers have been extremely careful not to rush in and buy the market without good reason, and even when they do the buying tends to taper off fairly quickly. ‘We have had two days of serious declines in the last month and there is a feeling that some traders are scared to back into the water.’ He added: ‘We are expecting the Dow Jones to open 40 points lower, at 16,240, and the speech from Janet Yellen that is expected today is already taking its toll on the equity market. ‘Now that the September question has been put to bed the focus is now on December, and the latest Fed update wasn’t dovish enough to rule out at rate hike at the end of the year. ‘The full extent of the Chinese economic slowdown and the devaluation of the yuan has yet to play out, but the US unemployment and housing data are strong which is keeping dealers divided over a December interest rate hike.’ Yellen will speak at the University of Massachusetts in a lecture after the US markets close and investors will be searching for any vague hint on the timing of the first US rate hike in almost a decade. Before that though, a batch of US data will be in focus, including the latest weekly jobless claims and durable goods orders at 1.30pm London time, and new home sales at 3pm. US durable goods orders are forecast to show a 2.3 per cent drop in August, compared to a 2.2 per cent increase a month earlier. In London, sharply lower oil prices sent heavily-weighted energy majors into the red, with BP dropping 2 per cent or 6.3p to 323.2p, while Shell was 22.5p lower at 1,553p. Sainsbury's was also lower ahead of a trading update next week, with shares hit by a downbeat broker note from HSBC which cut profit forecasts for the chain. Shares lost 3.2p at 225.5p. Engineer Smiths Group was another faller, giving back some of the gains seen on Wednesday after full-year results showed higher profits but falling sales. Shares fell 36.5p to 1002.5p. But Lloyds Banking Group was one of the biggest blue chip risers after reports that a leading fund manager expects the lender to become a big dividend payer within two years. Shares in the part-taxpayer-owned bank rose 1.2p to 74.1p. And high street retailer Next was also among the top flight gainers, ahead 67.5p to 7,562.5p after a rating upgrade from broker Nomura. In the FTSE 250, Thomas Cook climbed 2 per cent or 1.9p to 117.8p after saying it made good progress over the summer despite ‘external shocks’ including the deadly terror attack in Tunisia. With the North African country effectively shut down to tourists, it saw a surge in bookings to Greece and Egypt. Long-haul and own-brand sales were also doing well. But discount retailer Poundland was a big mid cap faller after warning over half-year profits as it also revealed takeover target 99p Stores was in weaker financial health than previously thought. The news emerged as Poundland announced details of a £50million share placing to fund the £55million takeover. Shares fell 7 per cent, or 22.7p, to 286.9p. 10.00: The Footsie recovered from opening falls as the morning session progressed, pushing modestly higher as hard-pressed mining stocks steadied and travel shares advanced, although the overall mood remained cautious ahead of a speech tonight from Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen. By mid morning, the FTSE 100 was 4.0 points, or 0.1 per cent higher at 6,036.2, off the session peak of 6,055.64 but above the early low of 6,001.62, having put in a volatile performance so far this week. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said: ‘It’s as though a straitjacket has been applied to the markets. We’re seeing the occasional struggle but ultimately the energy that was helping sustain markets at the elevated levels earlier this year is being drained.' He added: 'With so many markets in correction territory now I’m sure we’ll soon break free from this and I think that would have happened last week had the Fed hiked rates. ‘In the meantime though, we may see it persist a little longer which means more downside may yet be to come.’ European markets were also modestly higher, with France’s CAC 40 index up 0.1 per cent, while Germany’s Dax 30 index gained 0.2 per cent helped by news that German business sentiment ticked up in September. The closely-watched Ifo Institute Index of German Business Executive Confidence rose to 108.5 in September, well ahead of economist forecasts for a reading of 107.9, and a touch higher than last month's 108.3 reading. But although current and future business confidence beat expectations, the current business climate was lower than expected, coming in at 114.0, compared with expectations of 114.7, raising concerns about the next survey when the VW emissions scandal feeds through. Today’s only UK data showed British banks approved the highest number of mortgages for house purchase last month since February 2014, while net mortgage lending hit a five-year high. The British Bankers' Association said its members approved 46,473 home loans in August, up from 46,315 in July and 40,454 a year ago. Net mortgage lending was £1.955billion in cash terms, up from £1.701billion in July and a level last exceeded in August 2010. The data further illustrated the buoyant state of the UK housing market which could be a trigger for the Bank of England when considering raising UK interest rates, although comments by a one of the UK central bank’s deputy governors today dampened down any expectations for a hike in the near future. Ben Broadbent told Reuters that he has not been on the brink of voting for higher interest rates, unlike some of his colleagues, and labour costs in Britain need to grow quite a lot faster to get inflation back to the bank's target. Among equities, travel firms enjoyed a strong session today after a well-received trading update from mid cap Thomas Cook sent its shares 4 per cent higher, with top-flight rival TUI Group and low-cost airline easyJet also enjoying a bounce. FTSE 250-listed Thomas Cook climbed after saying it had made good progress over the summer despite ‘external shocks’ including the deadly terror attack in Tunisia. With the North African country effectively shut down to tourists, it saw a surge in bookings to Greece and Egypt. Long-haul and own-brand sales were also doing well. Shares rose 5p to 120.8p Blue chip TUI, which issued its own well-received trading update yesterday, added another 10p to 1,218p, while easyJet rose 24p to 1,783p. Leading the FTSE 100 fallers was engineer Smiths Group, which made gains on Wednesday after full-year results showed higher profits but falling sales. Its shares fell 36.5p to 1,002.5p. Discount retailer Poundland was a big faller on the FTSE 250 after announcing a £50million share placing to fund its £55million takeover of rival 99p Stores. It also warned that 99p Stores' financial position had ‘weakened somewhat’ since its original look at the company's books ahead of the deal. Poundland shares fell 6 per cent, or 17.8p, to 291.8p. 08.50: The Footsie eased back in early deals, retreating after rallying yesterday following Tuesday’s slump, with investors cautious ahead of a speech tonight from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, one week after the US central bank kept rates on hold due to concerns over global growth. After around an hour of trading, the FTSE 100 was 11.2 points, or 0.1 per cent lower at 6,021.0, having closed 96.40 points, or 1.6 per cent higher yesterday, recouping around half of the previous session’s near 3 per cent drop. European markets were mixed, with Germany’s Dax 30 index up 0.1 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 index lost 0.4 per cent, uncertain after less dovish than expected messages from European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi in testimony yesterday. Angus Campbell, Senior Analyst at FxPro, said: ‘ Investors continue to rely heavily on cues from central bankers and in a speech yesterday Mario Draghi kept his cards close to his chest saying it was too early to make a call on whether the ECB’s QE program will be intensified which gave the single currency a little support. ‘Later today and a week on from the Fed’s decision to keep rates on hold Janet Yellen will be giving a speech at the University of Massachusetts. Designed to be a lecture on inflation and monetary policy, it is likely to be used as an opportunity by the Fed Chair to help clarify where they stand on the path of interest rates following the convoluted messages in last week’s FOMC press conference.’ Wall Street lost ground overnight, dragged down by economic reports portraying US factory growth as tepid and with China seeing its worst manufacturing contraction since the global financial crisis. Asian shares were mostly lower today, with Japan's Nikkei average, opening for the first time since Friday after a string of national holidays, tumbling 2.2 per cent as shares of Japanese automakers sagged in a delayed reaction to the Volkswagen emissions scandal. But Shanghai shares managed to recover 0.5 per cent of recent gains, although earlier gains were trimmed reflecting how investor confidence in the country remains wobbly. On currency markets, the pound managed to recover some recent lost ground versus the dollar, gaining 0.2 per cent at $1.5271, but was a touch lower against the euro at €1.3612 with UK rate hike thoughts fading further. Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent has said he has not been on the brink of voting for higher interest rates, unlike some of his colleagues, and labour costs in Britain need to grow quite a lot faster to get inflation back to the bank's target. Broadbent told Reuters that the BoE had to balance ‘fairly robust’ growth at home against a slowdown in emerging economies and he was not surprised financial markets had pushed back bets on when the central bank would start to raise rates. Stocks in focus today include: THOMAS COOK – Shares in the travel firm jump 4 per cent higher, up 4.7p to 12.6p after it says summer holiday sales were in line with expectations and that it has had an encouraging start to winter trading, leaving its guidance for full-year earnings unchanged. NEXT – Shares in the blue chip retailer gain as broker Nomura upgrades its rating to buy from neutral with an increased target price of 8,000p, up from 7,600p. OLD MUTUAL – The fund manager tops the FTSE 100 fallers list, down 5.6p at 186.6p as its stock trades without entitlement to its latest dividend payment, the only blue chip share to do so this week. WOLSELEY – Shares in the plumbing supplies firm lose 45p at 4.169p as broker Morgan Stanley cuts its rating to underweight from equal-weight. POUNDLAND – The discount retailer’s shares drop 4.4 per cent, or 13.6p to 296.0p as it says it will raise £50million through a placing of new shares in order to fund its acquisition of 99p Stores. The group also says it expects core full year pretax profit to meet market expectations, although it will be weighted towards the second half. DAILY MAIL & GENERAL TRUST – The newspaper group reiterates its full-year guidance, and says its adjusted results are expected to be in line with market expectations. DMGT shares add 7p at 758p. EUROMONEY – The publisher and events company – in which DMGT owns a stake – says it expects to report a fall in full year pretax profit and a 5 per cent decline in revenue for its fourth quarter, as challenging market conditions showed no signs of improvement. Euromoney shares flat at 1,064p. WS ATKINS – The design, engineering and project management consultancy said its first half performance is set to be in line with its expectations and said its outlook for the full year remains optimistic. Shares ease 8p lower to 1,384p. UBM – The media group confirms that it is in ‘highly preliminary discussions with a number of parties’ about the possible sale of PR Newswire. After gains yesterday on the disposal rumours, UBM shares slip 8.5p lower to 490.6p. TATE & LYLE – Shares in the food ingredients firm add 10.5p at 562.0p as broker Liberum Capital double upgrades its rating to buy from sell. ASOS – Shares in the online fashion retailer gain 12p at 2,546p as Liberum Capital ups its stance to buy from hold with a 3,300p target price. PREMIER FARNELL – Shares in the FTSE 250-listed electronics distributor shed 6 per cent, or 6.75p to 101.50p as broker Citigroup cuts its rating to sell from hold. 07.55: The Footsie is expected to start around 16 points lower this morning, retreating after a rally yesterday following Tuesday’s slump, with investors cautious ahead of a speech tonight from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, one week after the US central bank kept rates on hold. The FTSE 100 closed 96.40 points, or 1.6 per cent higher yesterday, recouping around half of the previous session’s near 3 per cent drop as commodity stocks rallied despite more worrying data from China’s factories. But Wall Street lost ground overnight, dragged down by economic reports portraying US factory growth as tepid and with China seeing its worst manufacturing contraction since the global financial crisis. Asian shares were also largely lower today, with Japan's Nikkei average, opening for the first time since Friday after a string of national holidays, tumbling 2.2 per cent as shares of Japanese automakers sagged in a delayed reaction to the Volkswagen emissions scandal. But Shanghai shares managed to recover 0.5 per cent of recent losses, although earlier gains were trimmed reflecting how investor confidence in the country remains wobbly. Mic Mills, head of Client Services at Capital Index said: ‘The European open looks pretty flat from yesterday and with no major economic news on the horizon concerns over Volkswagen and whether that is likely to filter through to other manufacturers, continuing Greek uncertainty together with the refugee crisis will likely weigh heavily today and even Draghi’s surprisingly hawkish comments yesterday are unlikely to be able to bring many Bulls to the party.’ ‘In the US Fed chair Yellen is due to speak and many will hope that she will shed some light on the likelihood of US tightening this year, however if previous speeches are anything of a benchmark we will be as uncertain afterwards as we are now.’ No important UK economic data is due for release today, aside from the latest BBA lending figures. Corporate news is also thin on the ground again, with just trading updates from travel firm Thomas Cook, and publisher DMGT of real interest. UK company news scheduled today includes: Trading updates: Thomas Cook, Daily Mail and General Trust, Euromoney International, WS Atkins Interims: Good Energy, 32Red, Air Partner, Dolphin Capital, SciSys, SVG Capital, Brainjuicer, Mission Marketing, Science in Sport, Mortgage Advice Bureau Ex-dividend factors to clip 0.5 points off FTSE 100 (Old Mutual) Economic news scheduled today includes: BBA mortgage approvals at 9.30am German Ifo business climate index at 9am US weekly jobless claims at 1.30pm US durable goods orders at 1.30pm US new home sales at 3pm"
"Welcome to 'Norway', Texas: where Norwegians think 'crazy' is normal",Norway,"Nearly half of the population of Clifton – the ‘Norwegian Capital of Texas’ – is Norwegian. Tom Dart visited and asked residents how they feel about the fact the word ‘texas’ is slang for ‘wild and crazy’ in their home country Put it down to polite Scandinavian reticence, perhaps. But though Norwegians have been using “texas” as slang for “wild and crazy” for decades, as Texas Monthly[http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/yall-norwegians-use-the-word-texas-as-slang-to-mean-crazy/] reported last week, apparently no one told the residents of the Norwegian Capital of Texas – and yes, there is one. An estimated 30-40% of residents in Clifton[http://www.cityofclifton.org/], population 3,500, can trace their heritage back to the land of fjords, social progressivism and $15 beers. Thousands of tourists have visited in recent years to see the Norwegian historical sights and festivals. Yet, “texas” as this might sound, the linguistic quirk is news to the locals. “I’d never heard that before,” said Trudy Sheffield, an estate agent. “First time I’ve heard of it,” said George Larson, director of the county museum. They saw the story on the internet last week: it went viral after a Texas Monthly article noted that “texas” is Norwegian slang for a crazy atmosphere – as in “Det var helt texas” – “It was totally nuts!” Sheffield does not entirely disagree. “Texas is kind of wild and crazy,” she said. “The slogan is ‘everything is bigger in Texas’, so that kind of works.” Like many quiet rural towns, Clifton was searching for a unique selling point to drive tourism a couple of decades ago. And like many small towns in central Texas, where large numbers of Czech and German immigrants settled in the 1800s, it has a rich European heritage. Sheffield (who is not of Norwegian descent) had a brainwave: “We’ve got all these doggone Norwegians – what can we do with that?” So the town redoubled its marketing, advertising “A day in Norway, Texas” tours to attract coachloads of seniors from Dallas and Houston. “I’d get on the bus in my Bunad[http://mylittlenorway.com/2009/05/bunad-norwegian-traditional-costumes/],” said Sheffield. In 1997, Clifton secured an official designation from the state legislature as Norwegian Capital of Texas. Settlers arrived in 1854 and established the southwest’s biggest Norwegian colony, led by Cleng Peerson[http://clengpeersoncabin.com], dubbed the father of Norwegian immigration to America. Sheffield had a brainwave: ""We’ve got all these doggone Norwegians – what can we do with that?” Fascinating though that is, Sheffield said that the hosts have realised their European visitors are generally more interested in eating barbecue, dancing the two-step and being taught how to rope a steer by cowboys. Next month brings the 67th annual Smorgasbord. December’s events include The Uprooting (a play about Norwegian immigration), a Norwegian Country Christmas Tour and a Lutefisk Dinner[http://www.smithsonianmag.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/people-places/scandinavians-strange-holiday-lutefisk-tradition-2218218/?no-ist]. Every day is a Norwegian day at the Bosque Museum in Clifton[http://www.bosquemuseum.org/], which claims to have the south and southwest’s largest collection of Norwegian artefacts, and may well boast the region’s biggest stock of viking helmets in its gift shop. “In my visits with Norwegians they certainly think of Texans as being, shall we say, frontier, wild west, whatever; that mystique is often present,” said Larson, the director. The oil booms in Norway and Texas led to a fresh wave of immigration in recent decades. Houston and Stavanger were even connected with a direct commercial flight until low crude prices[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/norwegian-oil-town-stavanger-texas-flights-cancelled] caused its demise last week. The Houston-area branch of the Norwegian Society of Texas has about 150 members, said its president, Belinda Klovning, and there is a Norwegian Seaman’s Church. Klovning, a 43-year-old, has lived in Texas for 14 years. She suspects “texas” entered the language when her parents’ generation learnt about the Wild West from movies and books. “Coming here and seeing here people wearing cowboy hats and boots, I was like wow, that’s cool, they’re wearing it for real!” she said. “My kids don’t use [the word] and I don’t think they’ve even heard it because they’ve lived in Texas for so long.” Klovning said it was akin to phrases such as “Det er helt gresk for meg” (It’s all Greek to me) or “Herliga London!” (Woah, that’s so cool!). “It’s just kind of in our vocabulary if things get a little wild, it’s like ‘Oh my gosh, that’s so texas!’ I still say it, I honestly do. Nothing bad about it – it’s just a little wilder than everyday life.”"
Norse play: skiing first tracks in Norway,Norway,"When Arnie Wilson disembarks the first plane of the season to ski in Geilo and Hemsedal, he discovers a rich history of snowsports, reliable snow cover and novel solutions to the “long Scandinavian nights” issue Quite a crowd greeted our charter flight’s arrival at the airport serving the small Norwegian[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/10457650/Where-to-ski-in-Scandinavia.html#nf] town of Fagernes (population 1,801) – local press, a choir, one person in a giant snowman outfit and another in a giant bear costume. The enthusiastic welcome, accompanied by almond croissants and plastic cups of glühwein, was all because we were the first plane-load of people to arrive for the start of the new winter season – always good news for the local tourism industry. The next morning’s headlines were already being written: I går kveld landet sesongens første charterfly på Fagernes (Last night the season’s first charter flight landed at Fagernes). All this excitement, despite the fact that weekly Sunday charter flights from Gatwick have been arriving here for almost 20 years, and tour operator Crystal has seen the potential too. This coming winter will be the company’s third season in a row here, with its first flight arriving this season on December 13. Norway’s largest resort is Trysil, close to the Swedish[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/10457473/Skiing-in-Sweden-Chilled-chic-and-effortlessly-cool.html] border in the west, with 26 lifts. But the advantage of Fagernes airport, 190km north of Oslo, is that it has short transfers to three smaller Norwegian resorts all offered by Crystal. Geilo is less than 100km away; Hemsedal (represented by the snowman, Valle) is just 75km away; and Beitøstolen, the smallest of the trio (from where the bear had come), is a mere 40km away. Although the Beitøstolen bear’s talk of dedicated children’s areas and activities such as snow rafting was compelling, we’d have to save that for another trip as we were going to Geilo and Hemsedal. • Where to ski in Scandinavia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/10457650/Where-to-ski-in-Scandinavia.html] Our first destination was Geilo. Since 2009, it has increased its pisted runs by about 25 per cent. Today’s 35km of runs – nine easy, 25 intermediate and five difficult (with the longest covering 2km) – served by 20 lifts, shared between both sides of the valley, may not sound overly generous, but the area is so varied it provided more than enough entertainment. That’s the thing about Norway – the resorts are not large (nor are they linked, as they often are in the Alps) and, in Geilo’s case, the mountains are not as striking nor as high as most peaks in the Alps, but there’s still much to recommend the experience. Geilo is referred to as great for beginners but there are certainly some challenges here. As we were to discover, for tree runs[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/picture-galleries/11180125/The-worlds-best-tree-ski-runs.html] in powder[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/skiguides/10411478/The-best-ski-resorts-for-powder.html#nf], this is the place to come, because there are plenty of widely spaced birches to weave around, and the resort’s three terrain parks keep freestyle riders happy too. For tree runs in powder, this is the place to come Geilo is arranged either side of a frozen lake. On the north shore is the old village, which grew up around the Oslo to Bergen railway line at the beginning of the 20th century. To the south is Geilolia, where ski school, rentals and our accommodation, the Vestlia Resort Hotel, are located at the foot of the slopes. The Vestlia could hardly have felt more cosy and friendly. Lit by a galaxy of candles, it has an appropriately Scandinavian feel, and these also make the long winter nights much cosier. But when I opened the curtains just before breakfast, around 8.15am, to let some light in and investigate the weather prospects, it was still pitch black. A silvery moon dominated the pre-breakfast sky, and the sun didn’t rise fully until after 9am, before setting around 3pm. But it’s a myth that the days are dark throughout the Norwegian winter and beyond. Days are certainly short in mid-winter but, as spring begins, Scandinavian resorts edge towards longer daylight hours than their Alpine counterparts. What the late-rising sun eventually revealed that December morning was a blizzard, in which we revelled, as we did in another heavy snowfall that evening. Norway’s snow record is arguably its most persuasive allure. Even when Alpine Europe is suffering, the snow is reliable, thanks to storms coming in from the Arctic Ocean and low ambient temperatures maintained by the country’s northerly latitude. Up here near the Arctic Circle the relatively low altitudes – Geilo is at 800m, with slopes up to 1,109m – are not a negative factor. Just in case blizzards do not come, the vast majority of Norwegian resorts have impressive snowmaking[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/features/11526193/Skiing-on-sewage-resorts-use-treated-wastewater-for-snow-cannons.html] infrastructure too – 50 per cent of Geilo’s slopes are covered. But it certainly wasn’t required during our visit. Less than an hour’s taxi ride north from Geilo – through an area where moose are often seen wandering – Hemsedal is one of Europe’s premier training centres for ski race teams. They come because of the consistent snow cover and good conditions, especially early in the season (in the last decade, Hemsedal has opened as early as November 1 and no later than November 28). On several days a week from just before Christmas until mid-March, the floodlights that line eight of the resort’s 52 pistes are switched on to illuminate pistes from 9am until 7pm, so very little slope time is lost to bad light. Plus, there’s night skiing from 6pm to 10pm on Fridays. The great Norwegian explorer, champion skier and Nobel Peace Prizewinner Fridtjof Nansen was one of the earliest tourists in Hemsedal, in 1898, a decade after he made the first crossing of the Greenland icecap. It’s safe to say he did not stay at Skarsnuten Hotel – the steel and glass example of cool, modern Scandinavian design, which has a convenient ski-in, ski-out location on the mountain – and was where our group lodged. Many of those working there were Swedish it transpired. Prior to the country drilling for oil in the North Sea Norwegians, with their strong work ethic, sometimes had three jobs – milking cows on the farms that dot both sides of the valley, operating ski lifts and running a taxi service after hours. Now, Norway’s ultra-strong, oil-rich economy attracts many Swedish workers. There’s even a local joke that if a British visitor wants to know the difference between these Scandinavian neighbours, visit a bar. The person pouring the drinks is Swedish; the one getting drunk is Norwegian. Hemsedal unlike Geilo, has some splendid peaks Despite being at a low 640m, Hemsedal, unlike Geilo, has some splendid peaks, which wouldn’t look out of place in the Alps. The slopes are a short bus ride from the resort town (Sentrum) although most of the accommodation is either on-mountain or at the lift base. In bounds, most of Hemsedal’s highest slopes are on the Tinden peak (1,444m) and tend to be wide open and easier than the runs through the trees on the lower slopes above the base area, which are steeper. The resort’s second, smaller, mountain, the pointed peak of Røgjin (1,370m) is optimistically referred to as the “Little Matterhorn” by locals and is where visitors can escape the busier slopes. We tackled some not too difficult runs with gusto – blue 14, and tougher reds 13 and 15 – from the top of Røgjin. Taking the Roniheisen chair back up, we spent a happy hour lapping the steep bowl. Hemsedal has challenging off-piste too, including some of the best backcountry[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/snowandski/features/11520105/Off-piste-skiing-confessions-of-a-backcountry-virgin.html#nf] in Norway over a steep ridge at the back of the resort. Those who do attempt it are strongly advised to take a guide as these runs can be dangerous. Straying from the recommended routes can lead to steep ravines, tight trees and sheer cliffs. Last winter Hemsedal finally created a piste to the centre of Sentrum. The 4km descent starts from Totten, the resort’s highest point at 1,497m, and it’s also accessible from mid-mountain. The new run will encourage the expansion of accommodation in the town as well, even though visitors staying there still need to take the ski bus to the lift base (Skisenter) at the beginning of each day. Sentrumsloypa, the new blue run, is more than just a useful route back into town; it’s an exciting, fast descent in its own right, with a 1,200m vertical drop and views over the picturesque resort town on the banks of the River Hemsila – zooming all the way down it made a glorious end to our trip. Counting the cost of Krone It’s hard to escape the fact that Norway is an expensive country, with costly meals and après drinks (a beer is around £10), so self-catering can help keep costs down. An appealing, and very Scandinavian, style of accommodation, is three- and four-star wooden cabins, found in all main resorts. How very cosy to self-cater in a traditional log cabin in the forest with a wood-burning fire and a private sauna, but still within a short walk to the slopes. After dark Geilo has night skiing on Wednesdays and Fridays, while Hemsedal offers it on Fridays during high season. But how about night dog-sledding? In Hemsedal, 22 Alaskan huskies, divided into four teams, took us skimming across the snow. The dog teams had starred in Nobody Wants The Night, a 2015 film starring Juliette Binoche. The activity, lasting between 90 minutes and two hours depending on the dogs’ speed, can be booked through Crystal: costing £111 for adults, £56 for children. Need to know A one-week trip with Crystal Ski Holidays (020 8939 0726; crystalski.co.uk[http://www.crystalski.co.uk/#nf] ), departing on January 10 2016, costs from £829 per person staying half board at the four-star Vestlia Resort in Geilo, or from £1,078 per person staying half board at the four-star Skarsnuten Hotel in Hemsedal. Both prices are based on two sharing, and include flights from Gatwick and transfers. A week’s self-catering in a four-star three-bedroom Forest Cabin in Geilo costs from £1,587 for a family of four, including flights from Gatwick and transfers."
"Getting emigrants home key to Irish economic recovery, Kenny tells forum; Diaspora has critical role, Taoiseach tells fourth Global Irish Economic Forum",Norway,"Attracting Irish emigrants back to Ireland will be key to sustaining our economic recovery, Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said. Opening the fourth Global Irish Economic Forum at Dublin Castle, Mr Kenny said the economic crisis had led to a resurgence in emigration, which ""has had a significant impact on our country, as we lost talent and energy"". ""As Ireland recovers, we need these people to come home, to their families and with their families, to share their experiences and take up good jobs."" Next year would be the first since 2008 that the number of Irish people returning from abroad would outnumber those leaving , Mr Kenny said. Almost 300 members of the Global Irish Network working in 29 countries are taking part in the two-day think-in in Dublin, which is focusing on sustaining the economic recovery. Different place Mr Kenny said Ireland was ""in a very different place"" to where it was when the first global forum met in 2009, thanks to ""the resilience and the patience of the Irish people"" and the assistance of the Irish diaspora. While more than 1,000 jobs were being created every week and the country was on track for a balanced budget by 2018, the recovery was ""still fragile and must be nurtured"". The ""advice, insight and support"" of the Irish diaspora would continue to be invaluable. ""You still have a critical role to play as we work to keep the recovery going,"" he said. Mr Kenny said many great ideas arising out of previous global forums had been implemented with huge success. Among the most noteworthy were the Gathering, a year-long tourism initiative that resulted in a 14 per cent growth in visitors from the US alone in 2013, and the Year of Irish Design 2015, a programme of international events showcasing Irish design talent. Inviting more ideas from delegates at this year's forum, he said he was particularly interested to hear their perspectives on the possible UK exit from the EU, which he described as a ""major strategic risk for this country"". Speaking about the 2016 commemorations next year, Mr Kenny said the Irish diaspora would play a vital role. ""2016 will belong to everyone on this island and to you, our friends and families overseas. It will belong to you regardless of political or family history simply because of who you are - you are part of our story."" Tánaiste Joan Burton said she was glad to see more female and young voices at the forum this year. ""I want to see more women leaders across all sections of society. I particularly want to see more women entrepreneurs, and the Government will do everything we can to support this,"" she said. London-based Irish tech entrepreneur Mary McKenna, who sits on the board of the Irish International Business Network, agreed, saying particular efforts needed to be made to invest in female-led start-ups, as only 7 per cent of venture capital funding goes to women. London-based Irish comedian Dara Ó Briain said Ireland should focus on what it could do for the diaspora, as well as what the diaspora could do for it. Referring to his encounter with a homeless person in Dublin, he said ""not all economic indicators are on the up"" here. Economist David McWilliams also stressed how diaspora engagement should be a two- way street, with benefits for the community abroad as well as Ireland. He said Ireland should protect itself against the cyclical nature of economic boom and bust by ensuring that wealth remained a constant. Ireland could do this by radically changing its relationship with the multinationals located here, by becoming a shareholder in these companies, which would remove the threat of them leaving Ireland. ""We could create a sovereign wealth fund for our citizens. Norway has a sovereign wealth fund based on oil, but we could have one based on brains."""
Notes from a wounded city; FT BIG READ: PARIS ATTACKS,Norway,"Even as ordinary Parisians struggle to process the horror of the assaults, politicians and pundits are spouting certainty and talking tough. As Simon Kuper argues, much of the rhetoric of the past week has been ill-considered - and perhaps dangerous. A homeless Guyanese man living outside on my street is extremely upset about the attacks here in Paris . He told me that while walking around last Friday evening, he turned a corner and suddenly saw men in black shooting at ""children"" - his word for the beautiful young people in the cafés. He says he hid under a car, and lay there fearing that the terrorists had seen him. I cannot be sure his account is true. But I do know that he has asked the best question about the attacks. At the moment he saw the terrorists, he thought: ""With what perception must I perceive this?"" It is the question we should all still be asking. Here in eastern Paris, where most of the attacks took place, this is a time of mood swings and confusion. Yet turn on the televisions and you see politicians and pundits spouting certainty. However ignorant they may be about Paris and France, they profess to know exactly what our problem is and how to solve it. This ignorance is not merely irritating. As we saw in the American response after September 11, it will also probably prove dangerous. Outwardly, Parisian life is returning to normal. As cafés fill up again (albeit with far fewer tourists ), I keep hearing that Parisians are ""resilient"" or ""heroes"". But these are distorting simplifications. More accurately, we are only starting to process the horror. My doctor, whose office is a kilometre from the Bataclan concert hall, says that on Monday she had expected to see patients complaining of stress or depression. It didn't happen. However, she adds, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January it took weeks before people cracked. Initially, adrenalin and communal support sustained them. Parisian children are beginning to deal with events too. On Monday, in the playground of my children's primary school some kids boasted of having heard shots from their homes. Maybe they did. On our walk to school on Thursday, my children explained to me the worldview and theories of the afterlife of suicide bombers. Now my nine-year-old daughter is preparing to give a class talk on jihadi terrorism. She has drawn her information from the children's newspaper Le Petit Quotidien, whose blanket coverage of the attacks includes a helpful page headed, ""Des mots pour comprendre le terrorisme islamiste"", or words to understand Islamist terrorism. (The French don't spend much time shielding kids from reality.) Familiar script If ordinary Parisians are struggling to come to terms with events, most politicians have achieved certainty. We have seen this film before: after 14 years of jihadi attacks on western cities, we know the script. The stricken country's leader - George W Bush in 2001, French president François Hollande now - comes up with a quick, tough, emotionally satisfying response. Mr Hollande proclaimed that ""we are at war"" and ordered bombing of Isis territory. The French parliament has suspended democracy, enacting a three-month state of emergency . The pundits, too, have already made their diagnoses. Whatever a commentator's views, the attacks proved them right. Rightwing hawks see a ""war of civilisations"", want the west to turn away the refugees and call for war in the Middle East - all curious echoes of Isis's views. Meanwhile, many leftists describe the attacks as retribution for the west's wars in Muslim countries. The outbreak of certainty is predictable. Politicians want to show instant leadership. (The last thing I wanted to hear after the bloodbath was Donald Trump's take on our situation, but I got it anyway.) Pundits operate in a thriving ideas economy where the prizes are big speaking fees, TV contracts and book deals. The people with the clearest messages win. Think how many careers in media, politics and the security industry were made by Osama bin Laden. Now Isis is doing the same. Any commentator still asking, ""With what perception must I perceive this?"" will not make the big bucks. As the misguided US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq taught us, the emotional days after an attack are the worst time for quick decisions - especially since there is no simple, satisfying solution to Isis. The reality of Paris is also more complicated than the grand theories being unleashed upon us. The cliché is that terrorism in France - the western country that has suffered the most attacks - is the logical outcome of the French failure to integrate their ""Muslim community"". This argument is dubious. True, many French Muslims live on poor housing estates in grim suburbs. But it is unclear whether the sociology explains the terrorism. London, with its booming economy and pretty good ethnic integration, also produces jihadi terrorists. So does the Islamic oil state Saudi Arabia. Even if France somehow created economic nirvana, it would probably still produce terrorists. Norway does. Both right and left also oversimplify France's ethnic situation. The right depicts jihadis fighting a war of civilisation, whereas the left sees a multicultural paradise. In fact Paris has both those things. It also has many unhappy poor, alienated people of Muslim origin who would not dream of shooting anyone; they just dream of office jobs. Then there is the banal reality of millions of people simply trying to live their daily lives. "" Métro, boulot, dodo "" (subway, job, sleep) doesn't leave enough free time to fight wars of religion. The well-known solution On Wednesday, I stood on the touchline at my children's football club watching kids and coaches from the big three monotheistic religions have fun together. Depictions of a ""Paris intifada"" that unites all Muslims would not survive 10 minutes' contact with local reality. Just ask Grégory Reibenberg, Jewish father of a girl who was at my daughter's crèche: his Muslim wife, Djamila Houd, was killed in his café, the Belle Equipe. Or ask the family of two Muslim sisters murdered alongside Houd. One of their brothers, Abdallah Saadi, his face trembling as he struggled not to cry, told French TV channel iTéle: ""We have always worked. We are the antithesis of what thousands of weak-minded people might think of - of everything and whatever, really. We are just citizens like everyone. My parents are in absolute distress."" The massacre killed people of all religions and none. Since 9/11 we have learnt so much about jihadist terrorism, and we have ended up less certain than when we began. Anyone assembling a view needs to absorb what Erik Bleich, an expert on France and race at Middlebury College in Vermont, calls ""seemingly conflicting bits of information"". For instance, Mr Bleich says: ""Muslims did this in the name of Islam, but most Muslims don't accept these acts."" The refugee issue is irritatingly complicated too. Isis might indeed have slipped one of the stadium bombers into the stream of refugees from Syria. Moreover, he may not have been alone. No one can guarantee that every refugee who has arrived in Europe this year is peaceful. On the other hand, the refugees' suffering is great; Isis hopes we will shut them out; they can help our economies, and the risk they represent is comparatively small. Americans terrified of Syrian refugees ought to study the figures compiled by Charles Kurzman, sociologist at the University of North Carolina: since 9/11 the US has suffered more than 200,000 murders, of which Muslim-American terrorists committed 50. Randall Hansen, political scientist at the University of Toronto, asks a pertinent question. ""Would the Paris attacks have occurred without refugee involvement? Of course: Isis has plenty of recruits in Europe. And if we leave hundreds of thousands of young men rotting in refugee camps or urban centres in the global south, with no education, no hope, no future, then we will greatly magnify the security threat."" Still, that seems to be the west's game plan. When the debate turns to military action, more certainties come pouring out. HL Mencken, the late American satirist, warned: ""There is always a well-known solution to every human problem - neat, plausible and wrong."" The well-known solution today - the one preferred by both western hawks and Isis - is to go to war with Isis. The parallel cited is the war against Nazi Germany. But Germany was a state. Isis has a faux-state that the west could flatten next week, but Isis is above all a global idea. As we have discovered since 9/11, you cannot bomb away an idea. Bombing Isis territory will kill lots of Isis members and the civilians they brutalise, yet might not reduce terrorism. ""I think [bombing] is going to get rid of Isis,"" says Jytte Klausen, counterterrorism expert at Brandeis University, but she adds that bombs will not get rid of terrorism. ""We need to prepare ourselves for a far worse wave of terrorist attacks once we push [Isis] out,"" she says. ""Those terrorists are going to have to go somewhere - where are they going to go?"" In any case, as the Paris attacks showed, many of them are already here. To compare Isis to Nazi Germany is to give the outfit undue importance. A better comparison might be with the Northern Irish, German, Italian and Basque terrorist movements that peaked in the 1970s. Cumulatively, they killed thousands of people. They never surrendered. A few of them are still fighting. Arguably, we never defeated them - but we learnt to curb them and to live with them, and eventually they went out of fashion. (Diplomacy worked in Northern Ireland, but doesn't seem well suited to Isis.) That kind of slow waning may be the best outcome on offer. This is unsatisfying, but then we will never attain zero risk. An inward cheer There are some things we can do. Perhaps the most important is better information sharing between western intelligence agencies. It is scandalous that Abdelhamid Abaaoud, Belgian puppet master of the attacks , was not arrested in Greece in January, after raids by security forces in Belgium disrupted his previous plot. He appears to have travelled freely between Syria and Europe for years, says Ms Klausen. Meanwhile, to avoid giving in to fear, we need to put the danger from Isis into perspective. Even in this deadliest of years in greater Paris, the murder rate will probably end up lower here than in America's ""safest big city"", New York. But as a friend says: ""Tell that to your brain."" Terrorism is a kind of violent branch of the advertising industry: it creates unforgettable images. Then we journalists disseminate the images. I plead guilty: I have spent the week writing about the attacks. My excuse is that I live in eastern Paris. This is my local story. However, I am hoping the work will tail off now and each time another of my foreign colleagues leaves Paris, I cheer inwardly. The attacks need to be covered, but to make them the world's lead news story for weeks is to join Isis's PR wing. The blanket coverage of Paris also reveals the reality that in the global media black lives may matter, but western white lives matter more. Terror attacks in Kenya, Lebanon, Turkey, Nigeria and now Mali get relatively little international attention - one reason why Isis hit the world's most visited city. Since the Charlie Hebdo attacks, Parisians have been getting used to terrorism. The sound of sirens has become our background music. My children now hardly notice the policemen with machine guns on their school's street. My daughter remarked that since she had lived through two terrorist attacks in her own neighbourhood, I at my age must have been through dozens. Not so, I told her. I have no idea whether growing up like this will damage my children. We may only find out when they are grown up, by which time - although we'll always have Paris - we may still be fighting jihadi terrorism."
"Quebec is facing its own ‘dirty’ energy export problem; Environmentalists are calling for Barack Obama to deny a permit to a cross-border infrastructure project aimed at importing “dirty” energy from Canada, but this time it’s not oil",Norway,"MONTREAL -- Well, this sounds familiar. Environmentalists are calling for U.S. President Barack Obama to deny a permit to a cross-border infrastructure project aimed at importing “dirty” energy from Canada. This time, however, the target of environmentalist ire is not Alberta oil but hydroelectricity from Quebec, the very power source Premier Philippe Couillard insists is the key to “rebranding” Canada as a clean energy superpower that looks more like Norway than Saudi Arabia. The Sierra Club of New Hampshire begs to differ. The conservationist group is one of a growing list of opponents dead set against a proposed $1.6-billion (U.S.) transmission line that would carry hydro power from Quebec through New Hampshire, mostly to consumers in Massachusetts and Connecticut. They say that branding Quebec power as “clean” amounts to greenwashing. The 1,090-megawatt Northern Pass (http://www.northernpass.us/index.htm[http://www.northernpass.us/index.htm]) transmission line that New England utility Eversource Energy wants to build is the most advanced of several infrastructure projects that would vastly increase the quantity of power Hydro-Québec could export to the United States. But Mr. Couillard, who has been ambivalent toward TransCanada Corp.’s Energy East oil pipeline given opposition among Quebec environmentalists, now has to counter “dirty” energy charges of his own. “Why are we allowing [Eversource] to slice our state in half for an unnecessary transmission superhighway carrying dirty power from a foreign country through our state?” Sierra Club of New Hampshire chairman Jerry Curran and state director Catherine Corkery wrote (http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/19219682-95/our-turn-state-doesnt-need-northern-pass[http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/19219682-95/our-turn-state-doesnt-need-northern-pass]) last month. The “dirty” label comes from the carbon released in the flooding of vast swaths of boreal forest to build new hydro dams, such as the 1,550 MW Romaine River project now nearing completion, and ongoing disputes with the Innu First Nations whose territories are most affected by the project. Hydro-Québec “strongly objects” to the Sierra Club’s characterization of its power. The Quebec utility maintains that over a 100-year life cycle – the normal lifespan of a large hydroelectricity project – the amount of greenhouse gases generated is comparable to wind power and five times less than the quantity generated by a solar project, whose panels would need to be replaced several times over. The industrial processes and mining of rare earth metals used in making photovoltaic panels remains a little-mentioned black spot on solar’s sunny image. Still, Mr. Couillard has encountered a chilly reception on recent road shows in New England. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker is a strong advocate of importing hydro power from Quebec to meet the state’s targets for reducing greenhouse gases. But utilities that serve the region argue that a Baker-backed bill now before the state Senate, which would smooth the way for long-term contracts for up to 2,400 MW of Canadian hydro power, would drive up electricity rates and undermine local renewable power projects. The chief executives of six major U.S. utilities have called (http://nepga.org/2015/09/letter-from-six-ceos-on-ma-hydro-legislation/[http://nepga.org/2015/09/letter-from-six-ceos-on-ma-hydro-legislation/]) the Senate bill a government “intrusion into the competitive electricity market” that would increase power costs by $777-million (U.S.) above market rates every year, or almost $20-billion over the life of the contracts. The biggest obstacle to the realization of Mr. Couillard’s grand plan to increase Quebec’s hydro exports, however, remains opposition to Northern Pass. The project is to New Hampshire what the Keystone XL pipeline has been to Nebraska – a political hot potato, embroiled in legal challenges, that risks becoming entangled in presidential politics. This month, Mr. Obama denied Keystone a permit and could deal a similar fate to Northern Pass if the U.S. Department of Energy makes a final recommendation on the project before he leaves office. Otherwise, it will fall to his successor to approve the project, or not. Eversource has agreed to bury about 100 kilometres (up from 13 kilometres in its original proposal) of the 300-kilometre Northern Pass underground to ease concerns about the line’s impact on the environment and tourism in and around the scenic White Mountain National Forest. But burying the entire line, as some have called for, would be uneconomical. Most U.S. politicians have refused to back Northern Pass, which also requires Hydro-Québec to spend about $500-million (Canadian) on new lines in Quebec and interconnections with New Hampshire. New Hampshire’s four-member congressional delegation – which includes two Democrats and two Republicans – has called for the federal Energy Department to take “ample” time to hear out opponents. Northern Pass is sure to be on the agenda when Republican presidential candidates appear at a New Hampshire debate just three days before the state’s February primary. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has already had to tiptoe around Northern Pass, saying that “protecting the beauty” of New Hampshire “should be given great weight” in any decision. If he doesn’t want to jinx his chances, Mr. Couillard should refrain from calling Northern Pass a “no-brainer.” Globe and Mail Update"
"Norway mulls medical heroin, as it grapples with Western Europe's highest overdose rate",Norway,"BERGEN, Norway _ The pale, zombie-like addicts staggering through concrete underpasses make an unlikely scene in wealthy Norway's picturesque second city. As a gateway to the fjords which zigzag the oil-rich nation's long coastline, Bergen is the last stop on a global drug route that gives it one of the worst heroin problems in Europe. Now with a change in local government here and in the capital, Oslo, there is an appetite to use radical policies to curb the alarming number of Norwegians who die from heroin overdoses each year. Alongside traditional replacement therapies, such as methadone, the new left-wing local leaders want to use a medical form of injectable heroin to treat the most at-risk users. The official goal is to wean them off the drug entirely, but even the most ardent supporters admit the most achievable target is to bring them within a safer environment, while helping to tackle the crime associated with heavy drug use. ""We can't go on criminalizing our drug users. We need the trust between us and the health professionals,'' said Kim Arnetvedt, an addict and member of the Association for a Humane Drug Policy, a campaign group. Norway has the worst heroin mortality rate in Western Europe with 70 drug deaths per million inhabitants in 2013, according to the EU's drugs watchdog, the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drugs Addiction. In the continent as a whole, Norway trails only Estonia, with 127 deaths per million. The average is 16. Like most of Bergen's estimated 1,100 regular users, Arnetvedt spends much of his time near the city-run Straxhuset needle exchange centre between the housing projects and the industrialized western edge of the city where addicts can get clean needles, medical help and a hot meal. He reluctantly dips in and out of medical rehabilitation programs run out of centres like this, but is highly suspicious of a health system that he says is too close to the police and makes ""every day of addiction miserable.'' He is treated with methadone and anti-depressants, but says he can't imagine ever shaking his addiction to heroin. Outside the needle exchange there is a more-or-less open drug market. Dozens of users and dealers cut deals unmolested by police. Last year a crack-down on heroin users in the notorious Nygaards Park in the centre of town drove them into the tourist-heavy city-centre. Straxhuset leader Hugo Torjussen says the unofficial policy is to allow them to congregate here instead. The proximity of health professionals makes it safer in case of overdose, and the new local government has cut through political deadlock to sanction a safe injecting room for users to shoot up their own gear inside. Even so, a small number of addicts are either too suspicious or immune to the methadone to start treatment at all. Ola Joesendal, deputy director of Bergen's Haukeland Hospital, said more than 90 per cent of the city's heroin addicts receive methadone treatment. ""But for a very small amount of addicted people it is not possible to establish contact through the (methadone) maintenance program,'' he said. ""If we have the opportunity to reach them through heroin, then they can be reached.'' Otherwise, their isolation from health professionals means they are the users most likely to die, he says. Some are skeptical. Anti-drug campaigner Mina Gerhardsen says free heroin therapy would put too much strain on many of the vulnerable users it is intended to reach. ""They won't be able to use this because you need to show up at the same place and time several times a day,'' she said. ""Many of these people are not capable of that.'' Gerhardsen also said the publicly-funded medical heroin programs would be too expensive. The cost of the treatment can reach some $22,000 per year, compared with an upper level of $3,800 per year for methadone, according to the EU drugs watchdog. First synthesized from opium poppies in 1898, and marketed as ""Heroin'' by the German pharmaceuticals giant Bayer, diamorphine was initially prescribed as pain relief. Later evidence showed its addictive qualities and it was banned in most countries, but continued to be manufactured and made available in Britain, primarily for end of life care. It also survived as a street drug where it is mixed with other toxins and its purity varies dangerously. In 1991, Switzerland established a small scale trial, using diamorphine to treat heroin addicts unresponsive to other treatments such as methadone. Later trials in Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany all showed that supervised injectable heroin can be effective for targeting this marginal group, according to the EU watchdog. It said the therapy creates ""major reductions'' in their continued use of illicit street heroin, ""major disengagement from criminal activities'' and ""marked improvements in social functioning.'' Joesendal says this type of harm reduction is at the heart of the proposed policy. The drug is still available in these countries in small-scale quantities and strictly controlled conditions. However, wary of encouraging use rather than rehabilitation, in 2013 Norway's Conservative-led national government rejected Joesendal's application for a medical heroin trial. Cecilie Brein-Karlsen, deputy health minister for the junior ruling coalition partner, the Progress Party, says the change in local government to Labor in September will not force the Department of Health to change its mind. ""It is not an option from the government's point of view,'' she said. ""We think we should prioritize other measures.'' The government's overdose prevention strategy advocates persuading users to switch to smoking, which is far safer than injecting. Yet it will not allow addicts to use Oslo and Bergen's injecting rooms to smoke the drug. ""The injecting room is supposed to help prevent overdose,'' argues Brein-Karlsen. ""Since smoking does not cause overdose, we don't think it is appropriate to use it in the injecting rooms.'' Pricey doses of between $30-35 per hit make smoking wasteful for addicts who get a stronger high by injecting straight into their veins, especially considering that the average user will need four or more a day. In Norway, injecting has long been the preferred method. The Conservative government has been radical in other ways. Straxhust is part of an ongoing trial to hand out and teach users how to administer Naloxone, a nasal drug that reverses the effects of overdose. Many of the addicts in the centre say they have used the spray to save their friends. Some have experienced it as a rare highlight in a tragic life. Birgitte Langoey's is a depressingly familiar story of a childhood scarred by domestic violence. ""I grew up never with peace, always afraid,'' she says. When her husband died at 31, and her 6-year-old son was taken into protective care, her grieving brother-in-law introduced her to heroin. ""Then it was no thinking, no feeling, no worries,'' she says. Now 43, she has struggled with addiction ever since. Earlier this year, when she found her boyfriend in spasms and blue on her kitchen floor, she was able to use the Naloxone kit to save his life. ""I am in heaven that he is alive,'' she says."
What will his life be like with climate change?,Norway,"How is a warming planet going to shape the life of a baby born in Toronto in December 2015? The Star asked 10 scientists from Canada and the U.S. to describe the ways climate change will redefine life in the 21st century. These stories are based on their educated guesses of best and worst case scenarios, based on the scientific consensus. BIRTH * Average global temperatures are 1-degree C higher than pre-industrial times for the first time in 2015 * Scientists warn at least 2 degrees C of warming is unavoidable The baby was born in December 2015 on a 7-degree C day. No snow yet on the ground, so parents are less nervous driving home from the hospital. They drive a fuel-efficient SUV. They’re waiting for an affordable model that runs on gas for long distances and on electricity for city driving. Options are limited, which explains why plug-in vehicles are only .05 per cent of car sales. The father grew concerned about climate change after he was bitten by a blacklegged tick on Toronto Island, unheard of a couple of years ago. He didn’t develop Lyme disease, but it was a wake-up call. The mother started worrying after the Toronto flood of 2013 left a foot of water in their basement and friends lost their home in Calgary’s record-breaking flood. Drought in California and unprecedented forest fires in western Canada left an impression. Something, she has felt, is “not quite right” with the seasons. A couple of friends think she’s being dramatic. They have been following the Paris climate summit and learn that 2015 is expected to be the hottest year ever recorded and that average global temperatures are now for the first time 1-degree C higher compared with pre-industrial times. Now, with their first child, the climate problem has taken on a sense of urgency. Yet they are optimistic even though they know that at least 2 degrees C of warming can’t be avoided. Ontario has phased out coal-fired electricity. Alberta is planning to do the same and newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seems to take the issue seriously. They hope any agreement that comes out of Paris will prevent the worst. Age 20, 2035 Best case (2C increase) * Sea levels have risen by 15 cm * Toronto’s summers and winters are 1-degree C warmer, a result of emissions from the 1990s “Using gasoline will be increasingly viewed as anti-social behaviour.” — Deborah de Lange, Associate Professor of Global Management Studies, Ryerson University Back in the T-Dot, it’s been a warm winter — again. Officials had been predicting for years that it would be an average of a degree warmer compared with 20 years ago. Global CO2 emissions began to fall in the early 2020s, and have continued to fall, but today’s warmer temperatures are the result of emissions from the 1990s. The good news is the climate beast is beginning to be tamed. Career paths have changed. Whether choosing med school or engineering, there is a greater focus on climate adaptation. Everyone wants to design a better electric-car battery, even though progress there has been impressive. You can buy an electric sedan from Tesla Motors for $25,000 that can drive from Toronto to Montreal on a single charge. Half of all cars sold in Ontario now are fully or hybrid-electric. Worst Case * Formerly tropical diseases are endemic in Toronto * Storms and high seas regularly batter costal cities “Even in 20 years, it will be a different world, one that we will have trouble recognizing.” — John Smol, Canada Research Chair in Environmental Change, Queen’s University Weather records are being broken every week. Halifax, where his favourite aunt lives, has been battered by hurricanes and fierce snowstorms every second year. His favourite vacations have been in the Florida Keys — the islands are still there — and the Maldives, where the president has started buying land so his people can be relocated when rising waters take over. He used to love to fish for trout, but with longer and more intense summers, the trout have all but disappeared. Algae blooms, on the other hand, are proliferating every summer, making swimming hard in the Great Lakes. 40 years old, 2055 Best case (2C increase) * Aggressive action over the past 20 years has warming under control * Maximum summer highs hit 44C in Toronto, up from 37C in 2015 He has worked for 10 years as a family doctor. Cases of heat exhaustion, not to mention anxiety and depression, have risen notably. Aggressive climate action over the past 20 years has global emissions under control, but latent CO2 in the atmosphere still makes every season warmer. The maximum daily summer temperature hits 44C, and there are four times as many heat waves in a typical year; crops and livestock suffer. Average daily rainfall is twice what it was in 2015, but the city is mostly prepared for the occasional deluge. Home adaptation audits are mandatory and most properties have been retrofitted or built to flood-resistant standards. Over the past three decades, the city created green spaces to better absorb rainfall. Roads have been paved with a permeable asphalt made from recycled materials that allows water to seep into the ground more evenly. Emission-free vehicles, mostly powered by battery but increasingly with fuel cells, represent nearly all new models sold. Owners of noisy gas-guzzlers pay an extra emissions tax and gas is $3 a litre. Worst case * Meat is a luxury too expensive for most Canadians * U.S. summers are too hot for children to safely play outside He is a family physician in East York, lives in the neighbourhood, is married and has two daughters; the family owns one small electric car. But there are food scarcities — even brawls at grocery stores, where security guards are common. There are new careers: Ecologists to help slower-moving species escape a warming climate; social workers to help settle climate migrants — thousands from sinking island countries — adapt and integrate. Research into genetics and seed banks and vaults like the one in Svarlbard, in Norway, have become essential to preserve declining genetic variation. Island nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Maldives are closer to being submerged. In low-lying countries like Bangladesh, frequent stories about evacuations from rising sea levels and ever-more powerful typhoons don’t shock people any more. Selling what was once premium waterfront property in places like Vancouver is now nearly impossible. Resale values have plunged. A large part of California is desert, and in many parts of the U.S., summers are too hot for children to play outside or for people to work outdoors. 60 years, 2075 Best Case (2C increase) * Gas-fuelled cars are gone from Toronto’s streets * Global emissions fall to 80 per cent of peak levels He decided to retire early and purchased an electric SUV with power-collecting solar paint sprayed onto the body that charges the battery while parked. The car can also charge wirelessly at special stations. It has excellent range — can get to the cottage in Highlands East and back and still have a quarter charge left. Gas-fuelled vehicles haven’t been sold for years. Big trucks and planes still use “fuel,” but it’s synthetic, made from renewable hydrogen and CO2, captured and recycled from the air. Both his cottage and home are “net-zero”: they produce as much energy as they consume. Any extra energy produced is sold back into the grid or stored as hydrogen fuel. Net-zero construction has been mandatory for a decade. The province’s building code requires it, but most developers began embracing it during the 2050s. Homes are super-efficient, and home heating is electrified using air- and ground-source heat pumps, dramatically reducing use of natural gas. His granddaughter asked what Toronto was like “in the old days.” She was surprised that there were no backyard chickens or greenhouses on skyscrapers, and that downtown was filled with loud, pollution-spewing cars. Snow is now only something that “might” happen, so at least Toronto has saved on snow plowing and road repair. Global GHG emissions are at least 80 per cent below peak levels, and scientists say the climate is showing signs of stabilizing. That said, Toronto recently reported its 100th case of malaria. Worst case * Food and water shortages spark riots, even in the developed world * Property values plummet due to the heat island effect “There will be a lot of crime, gangsterism, and intergroup violence, and police forces will often be overwhelmed.” — Thomas Homer-Dixon, Global governance expert at Balsillie School of International Affairs, Waterloo. He sometimes tells his grandchildren that hundred-year storms and heat waves occurred roughly once in a century when he was a boy. He likes to tell them that it wasn’t so hard getting insurance when he bought his first house in 2038. In the city, the power grid fails often in the summer and the extreme heat caused by the urban island effect has depressed city property values. The rich have fled to the country. Food availability is a constant concern, although his family never goes hungry, but they often see footage of other cities running out of water and food, resulting in riots and chaos. While urban air pollution is better because of the large-scale shift to electric vehicles, forest fires often cover urban areas with thick haze. 80 years, 2095 * Canada shuts its doors to people fleeing wars of scarcity * Tourists head to the North for its snowy scenery “There’s a reason the Pentagon is worried about climate change. Shifts in climate may not cause wars, but they can destabilize regions already under stress.” — Simon Donner, associate professor of climatology, University of British Columbia Best case Canadians knew there would be a growing refugee crisis and have been accommodating, for the most part. Since retiring, he has spent much time volunteering for aid agencies. Even with warming stabilized at 2 degrees C, resource wars continue in some countries. More developed countries, such as Canada, are shutting their doors over fears that stressed social systems will collapse if they take in too many. Canada has been forced to become more self-sufficient: it grows more of its food, makes more of its goods, supplies its own energy. The oil sands were shut down in 2040, and provinces have worked with Ottawa to build a trans-Canada electricity grid. Canada exports enough hydroelectricity to supply a quarter of U.S. power demand. Old pipelines are used as conduits for power transmission lines. The country has become a global hub for renewable hydrogen production, used to make synthetic fuels for trucks, planes and heavy machinery. Canada also perfected methods for capturing CO2 out of the air, and exports that know-how. With greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere stabilized, and technology available to remove and reuse CO2 in the air on a large scale, the 22nd century could prove a period of unusual global stability. The whole family decided this year to spend the holidays at Polar Bear Provincial Park on Hudson Bay. Northern tourism is big. More “old folks” are taking their grandchildren north to experience something they have never seen: snow. Worst case * Rising temperatures render large parts of Africa, India, Middle East and Australia uninhabitable * Canada’s borders strain to manage massive waves of refugees “I worry that social cohesion will begin to fail. It is possible to imagine that civilization is unravelling, literally … not a world I’d wish on anyone.” — Jeremy Kerr, Biologist, University of Ottawa He wants to take his grandchildren for a splendid vacation, but planning one isn’t straightforward. There are some places he just can’t go. Maldives and Kiribati are long gone — non-mythical versions of Atlantis, lost beneath the waves. The barrier reef in Australia? Many reefs will be permanently gone and what will remain will be a shadow of what it was. In other countries, there is instability because of intense weather fluctuations and lack of food and water, making trips dangerous. Average temperatures will often rise above what the human body can deal with, across the Persian Gulf, in the Indian subcontinent, huge parts of Australia. Substantial parts of the world will be confronted with unreliable agricultural outcomes, dangerous pressure on freshwater supplies, and direct impacts from seasonally hot weather.

"Oil prices set for further fall, warns banker",Norway,"RUSSIA’S biggest banker has warned oil prices will fall further. Herman Gref, president and chief executive of Sberbank, one of Europe’s biggest financial institutions, said he believed a stronger dollar would see investors quit the oil market, pushing prices down. Mr Gref’s warnings are the latest evidence that Europe’s most important oil producer is bracing itself for long-term low-cost oil already hammering the North Sea. Russia can produce more cheaply than Scotland or Norway but is locked in to what many observers believe is a brutal price competition with Saudi Arabia. Mr Gref, who effectively answers to Russia’s central bank and whose words carry significant weight, predicted lower oil prices would bring further decline in the value of the rouble. This could have an important knock-on effect on tourism and exports from the rest of Europe. He said: “All the key trends are linked with further reductions. The dollar will probably strengthen. There will be a tougher policy from the Federal Reserve. And that means that dollars will leave the biggest derivative market, the oil market.” He added: “There is nobody who can predict the price of oil, but we are certainly no longer talking about $100 a barrel.”"
Trend on travel Norway has never been more affordable,Norway,"Ionce made the mistake of offering to buy a round of drinks for some Norwegian friends in Oslo. The bill for four small beers came to nearly £50, and it cemented in my mind the country's reputation for being virtually unaffordable for ordinary mortals. But something strange has happened. In barely a year, Norway has been transformed from being perhaps the most expensive destination in Europe to my top choice for good-value travel. If you have never been to this beautiful country - or are keen to re-visit - put it on your list of priorities for 2016; it will probably never be cheaper. How has this change come about? The first factor is the cost of getting there, which has dropped sharply over the past couple of years. According to Skyscanner (skyscanner.com), the average cost of flights from the UK has fallen by 31 per cent - from £208 in 2013 to £143 in 2015. This isn't just because of the lower price of oil; it's also because of the rise of Norwegian as a budget airline offering highly competitive fares. The second is the precipitous drop in the value of the Norwegian krone - which has long been underpinned by its North Sea oil revenues. As the price of oil has tumbled, so has the krone, now at its weakest rate against sterling for more than a decade. This week, you could get 13 kroner to the pound - at its peak just over two years ago, it was at 8.53. That's a huge drop of about 35 per cent. A 1,000kr dinner for two in a smart Oslo restaurant, which used to cost nearly £120, now costs £77; an 80kr glass of beer is £6.15 rather than the more than £10 I paid; and a 1,900kr night in the Oslo Grand Hotel is £150 instead of £223. So, if Norway is on your wish list, where should you go to make the most of these substantial savings? You probably won't need any introduction to the fjords - quite simply, the most spectacular coastal scenery in Europe, if not the world. However, most tourists view the precipitous cliffs and inkstill waters from the deck of a cruise ship, and if they pay in pounds through an international cruise company, they probably won't see much in the way of savings. Instead, arrange your trip using the local Hurtigruten services and pay in local currency. Then you will benefit from the full drop in the exchange rate, and you can hop on and off as you like, exploring the countryside on land as well as by sea. (See hurtigruten.no.) Along with the fjords, I would class the two great celestial phenomena - the midnight sun in midsummer and the Northern Lights in winter - as two of my top travelling experiences in recent years. North Norway is one of the classic destinations to witness both. Tromso - and the landscape around it - is the place to go. There's great skiing on offer too, with the higher latitude usually meaning decent snow coverage well past Easter. )For the Telegraph Travel app, with guides to the ski resorts of Hemsedal and Trysil, go to telegraph.co. uk /travelapp.) Finally, Oslo is one of those often overlooked cities, but it makes a great cultural short break. The fabulous new opera house offers top-notch productions at very reasonable prices (topcategory tickets to La Traviata in February - £55; operaen.no), while just across the harbour the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art has a spectacular new extension by Renzo Piano.

A continent with plenty of room for expansion,Norway,"Opening hotels across Africa is a 'calculated risk', Rezidor's boss tells Ben Martin When the luxury hotel in Mali that had been attacked by Islamic militants in November reopened last month, it was hailed as a triumph over terrorism. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the president of the West African nation, declared it ""a victory of life over the jihadists"". About 100 people congregated at the Radisson Blu in Bamako, Mali's capital, for the reopening ceremony. There were defiant scenes, with employees celebrating the occasion by hoisting aloft Gary Ellis, the hotel's manager. Staff were ""resuming our activities with a winner's spirit"", he said. It was in stark contrast to the situation less than four weeks earlier, when the 190-room property was the site of a bloody hostage-taking in which 22 people were killed, including three hotel employees and two terrorists. The attack took place on Friday Nov 20, and by the Monday, Wolfgang Neumann, the Austrian chief executive of Rezidor, the operator of the Radisson chain, had flown into Bamako. Neumann will never forget the sight that confronted him when he visited the hotel the following day. ""When you see it on television it's one thing, when you actually walk through a building and witness the damage it's quite different,"" he says. What Neumann, 53, saw was ""a hotel which was unrecognisable to what you normally see when you walk into a hotel. It was a real crime scene."" It was also a graphic reminder of the greater risks that multinationals face when operating in some parts of the developing world, markets that the Stockholm-listed, Brussels-based Rezidor is hoping will power its growth. Rezidor, which is majorityowned by the American hotels business Carlson, and best known for its Radisson Blu and mid-market Park Inn brands, runs 351 hotels across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Like its larger rivals, the company is expanding rapidly in emerging markets, particularly Africa. Fastgrowing and potentially lucrative, the developing world is becoming increasingly attractive to western hotel operators. In July, France's Accor agreed a partnership with an Angolan company to open 50 hotels in that country by next year, to counter waning growth in Europe. Marriott completed a deal to buy the South African hotels business Protea for about £136m in 2014, an acquisition that transformed the American giant into Africa's biggest hotel company. For Neumann, who has led Rezidor since 2013, the Mali attack is a blow because pushing into Africa and Russia is a big part of his turnaround plans. While the third quarter was the second strongest in Rezidor's history, with like-for-like revenue per available room up 8.7pc and total sales rising 8.6pc to £192.5m, the company still lagged behind its so-called Route 2015 revival plan, hurt by the impact in Norway of the oil industry downturn. Route 2015 was launched because the ""company has grown extremely fast, but from a financial performance angle we needed to improve the results"", Neumann says. To help strengthen the business, he is growing the company aggressively in emerging markets. Rezidor has 106 hotels in development, 62 of which are in the Middle East and Africa. Some of the cities that Rezidor has earmarked for expansion are in areas of the world where most tourists would balk at visiting, but where there is nevertheless growing demand for rooms from international business travellers. In 2017, a 260-room Radisson Blu hotel is set to open in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's oil and gas-rich Kurdistan region, an area that was ravaged by fighting with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant last year. This year, Rezidor plans to open a 126-room property in Misrata, its second in Libya, another strifetorn country that remains highly dangerous. The hotelier's first Libyan property, in Tripoli, has been forced to close twice since it was launched in 2009 and has only recently re-opened for the second time. Furthermore, the siege in Bamako is not the first time one of Rezidor's hotels has been attacked. In 2005, a suicide bomber blew himself up in the Radisson SAS in Amman, Jordan, one of three hotels that were targeted in simultaneous coordinated strikes. Neumann says the latest attack in Mali has not altered the company's expansion plans, and Africa in particular remains attractive to Rezidor. Indeed, the business boasts that its pipeline of hotels on the continent is bigger than that of any other hoteliers. ""Africa to us is a growth continent, with enormous potential, enormous opportunity,"" Neumann says. He insists that Rezidor is not blasé about the risks involved in operating in more dangerous countries, such as Nigeria. ""Obviously in these markets you have different additional safety and security procedures in place than in the more mature markets,"" Neumann says. Expanding in such regions is about taking ""calculated risks which are based on facts and analysis"", the Rezidor boss says, and he concedes that there are some countries in Africa where the company will not be opening properties any time soon, such as Somalia. But as Neumann points out, the increased risk of terrorism ""is no longer only [in] the emerging markets, it's also the mature markets."" Indeed, the travel and tourism industries were rocked by a string of attacks and scares last year, not all in the developing world. The gunmen struck at the Radisson in Bamako a week after the Paris outrages that claimed the lives of 130 people. The British Government has banned all flights to and from the airport at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh amid security fears, after a Russian passenger jet was brought down by a bomb at the end of October, killing 224. In another tragedy, 38 holidaymakers died in June after a gunman went on the rampage at a Tunisian beach resort. Neumann insists the business will not forget the families of the three employees who lost their lives in Bamako. ""We continue to pay the salaries of the deceased employees until their children have reached the age of 18,"" he says. Safety measures at the hotel, which had been equipped with armed guards at the time of the attack, have also been tightened. ""The important thing is that we do everything possible to have the security that one would expect from an international hotel and get on with it, continue to operate and to do everything possible for our guests and staff,"" he says. 351 The number of hotels operated by Rezidor across Europe, the Middle East and Africa 'Africa to us is a growth continent with enormous potential, enormous opportunity'"
Investments of SNP’s Business Minister linked to ‘Big Tobacco’,Norway,"SCOTLAND’s Business Minister is under fire after buying nearly £50,000 in shares in an investment trust heavily linked to big tobacco firms. Fergus Ewing registered the total value of the investments last month, despite the SNP Government taking a tough anti-smoking line. In Opposition, the SNP supported the ban on smoking in public places and the curb on tobacco advertising, while its MSPs have voted to extend the smoking ban to cars carrying children. However, Ewing, the Minister for Business, Energy and Tourism, has been criticised for his financial links to “Big Tobacco”. According to his Holyrood register of interests, Ewing acquired £25,723 of shares in the Perpetual Income and Growth Investment Trust in May. This was topped up in July with another £19,626 of shares in the same enterprise – taking the total value at December 7 last year to £44,093. Established in 1996, the trust’s objective is to “provide shareholders with capital growth and real growth over the medium to longer term”. Its top three holdings are all smoking-related: Reynolds American; British American Tobacco; and Imperial Tobacco. The holdings account for nearly 15 per cent of the trust’s entire portfolio. Ewing’s financial advisers manage the portfolio on his behalf, but he could set the ethical parameters of his investments. Perpetual’s sixth-biggest holding, as of November 30, was in BAE Systems, the defence and aerospace giant. Ewing is on his party’s right wing and is also known for holding views out of step with his party’s more leftish activists. He is believed to be one of the SNP ministers least hostile to fracking, despite his party membership’s staunch opposition to unconventional oil and gas developments. After the SNP Government announced a moratorium on fracking, Green MSP Patrick Harvie claimed Ewing had been on the brink of quitting as a result of the decision. However, a Scottish Government spokesman described the claims as “categorically untrue”. Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: “The public will be very surprised to find out Fergus Ewing is such a big investor in big tobacco firms.” She said the SNP Government must confirm if he had been involved in any decisions that had benefited the firms, adding: “People deserve to know that the first interest of Government ministers is creating a better society, not making profits for big tobacco firms.” A spokesman for Ewing said: “On being appointed as Minister for Energy, Enterprise and Tourism, Mr Ewing took advice from the then Permanent Secretary on how best to structure his investments. “This led to the sale of all holdings formerly held in individual companies. These were replaced with collective interests which, by their nature, are made up of a variety of differing investments. These are selected by financial advisers who manage these on Mr Ewing’s behalf. “Mr Ewing made a full disclosure of this in his MSP register of interests at the time.” Ewing also registered about £30,000 of shares in the Temple Bar investment trust this year and acquired a £32,430 investment in Finsbury Growth & Income. He has also registered stakes in about 20 further “collective interests” such as investment and unit trusts."
How the North Sea has shaped our world,Norway,"Saturnine and cruel, the formidable North Sea is often overlooked – even by those who live within a stone's throw of its steel-grey waters. But as a playground, theatre of war and cultural crossing-point, it has shaped the world in myriad ways, forging heroes and villains and sealing the fates of nations. Tom Blass boarded ship and travelled across it On a late autumn afternoon in 2012, I boarded a freighter, the MV Longstone, at the Humber port of Killingholme – to experience crossing the sea that had been preoccupying me for so long. At around midnight, the Longstone pulled away from the quayside and began its slow canter to Gothenburg – in the invisible wake of so many ships over the course of a millennium or two of history – availing me of the opportunity to reflect on the dramas played out on the North Sea and the role it had played in the story of Europe… I was to sleep in a spare but large and comfortable cabin on the other side of the corridor to the (steaming, odorous) galley. Scattered in the mess were relics of those who had travelled before me – well-thumbed back copies of Truckstop News and other reading matter. Patrick, the first mate, apologised for the lack of travelling companions. At weekends, he said, the ship was full to the gunwales with Irish truckers taking sides of beef to Sweden. I assured him that my own company would suffice. In the morning, from the bridge, I watched the freighter's great hull beating down on spry but pliant waves – and the horizon and the dipping gulls. Patrick told me that this would be a good crossing. He had spent most of the past year on the Falklands run, three weeks each way, arriving in Port Stanley feeling numb and listless. This trip was like a bus journey, a mere four-day round-trip from the river mouth to Gothenburg, a thousand miles distant on the coast of the Skagerrak (it's pronounced ""Skayraak"", like the rasping of a crow). In earlier centuries, the ships on this route, so much smaller and more fragile, made the same journey laden with bolts of wool and bundles of petticoats, returning with warm pelts from the deep North, ancient amber and timber. We were taking car parts and cat food to Sweden, and the boat would return with Volvos and Christmas trees. In a day, we would come close to the necklace of the Frisian Islands – Sylt, Amrum, Terschelling, Schiermonnikoog – and head north towards Heligoland and the Halligen half-islands, on the way passing a forest of oil rigs, slick pools of what once were ancient trees, the flared gas like distant match flames. Only a generation old, these are among the North Sea's newest accretions. But other features of the scar-impervious sea hold their course through all of its moods. Joseph Conrad had noted the North Sea's ""grey-green smudginess"" and its ""angry grin"", a gloomy sky above. The Phoenicians and Romans, he pondered, ""had experienced days like this, so different in the wintry quality of the light from anything they had ever known in their native Mediterranean"". At noon, a call to the bridge scratched through an intercom from the galley. ""Tell the passenger his lunch is ready,"" was the message from the cook, grey-skinned with a scalp as smooth as an eel's. At the galley door, he handed me a glistening hubcap of an omelette and urged me in the direction of the lonely mess room, where I ate a morsel, bolting it down with a nugget from the letters page of the Meat Trades Journal. At sea, every vessel within eyeshot becomes worthy of remark, as one might discuss the features of passing strangers on a lonely country walk. First, a handful of trawlers, then an improbably top-heavy container ship, and next another roll-on, roll-off vessel or ""ro-ro"", a direct competitor of ours, heading back from Gothenburg. Our mate knew its mate, and he regaled me with an impenetrable tale of commercial rivalries, undercutting shipping companies and not-to-be-trusted employment agencies, lest I should be duped into thinking that the transport industry was as simple as transferring goods from place to place. It was easy to be lulled into forgetting why I found myself aboard the Longstone, mesmerised by her slow roll, the passing of hours, the cups of tea. But the endless, churning mass of water was the very reason. I had set out to write a book about this sea and its world, too often snubbed by writers, derided for its moody lugubriousness, its inclination towards inclemency and damp, chilly sands. But both the sea and shores it beats upon possess their own allure. 'The sea deftly erases clues to its own history' (Getty Images) True, the sea so deftly erases clues to its own history. Already, many of the coastal defences built during the last world war have crumbled into oblivion. Relics from previous centuries and millennia are more elusive still. Early inhabitants of the North Sea basin, the Chauci and the Frisians, constructed terpen – earth mounds that rose above the floodplain upon which they built their homes, granaries, livestock stores and places for growing crops. Such structures yielded to the temper fits and ill-humoured sorties of the waves, which seldom left lasting damage. The move to build dykes – pushing back the chaos of the sea – coincided with the spread of Christianity. Surely, archaeologists have suggested, there is some parallel between the reclamation of the land and the saving of the pagan soul? It took classical minds born of warmer waters to name the sea and its parts and preserve their observations for posterity. The tides were a perennial puzzle. In 325BC, a Greek, Pytheas of Marseille, described their rising and falling as ""the lungs of the sea"" when he encountered them off the coast of Holland. Pliny the Elder, on being told of the twice-daily transformation of the mudflats of the Frisian Islands, was uncertain as to whether they should be regarded as belonging to land or sea, challenging the long-held axiom that the one is not the other. Pliny called the sea adjacent to Britain the Oceanus Britannicus, and that adjoining the German coast the Mare Germanicum.

Partly on account of those treacherous tides, but also because they were not the masters of these waters. It was the Frisians and other tribes that possessed the upper hand, and the Pax Romana applied less readily out of reach of land. In AD69, Roman vessels fought a pitched naval battle with a cohort of mutinous Germans who had had the audacity to steal 24 of Caesar's finest galleys. A century on and the Picts were the most assiduous of the piratical tribes. Later, it was the Franks and the Saxons. The last straw was a maritime assault on Roman Britain and northern Gaul in AD367. Described as a barbarica conspiratio, this was a hellish combination of Picts, Scots, Saxons, Franks and even the Attacotti, an elusive tribe of native British barbarians, possibly cannibals. Hundreds of years after the Romans had decamped came the Norsemen, sacking the monastery at Lindisfarne and sending history text books a-tremble for 1000 years. Perhaps because the tonsured, peaceable monks would ultimately write those text books, their former tormentors have been sidelined within the European narrative, dismissed as part of its misspent youth. Proper, respectable, history begins with the payment of taxes and tithes and the consolidation of the power of the Church – transforming the North Sea as a political space and pushing the Scandinavian kings and warlords to the fringes of a Europe whose centre of gravity now lay further to the south. Trade flourished as burgeoning cities inland demanded more in the way of goods from overseas. Naval architecture responded in kind. In middle age, the once sharp-prowed longboat, so well suited to slipping (viciously, inquisitively, lustfully) in and out of estuaries, lost its sleekness. Its successor – the fat, capacious cog – was sluggish and portly in contrast with the svelte beauty it replaced, but suited the purposes of a general trading ship, with sufficient bulk to carry cargoes of grain, timber, wool and leather… Boat design reflected the topography of the coast, the needs of trade and the perils of the time, whether tides or pirates. And over time, taller, straighter dykes and sea walls and ever more efficient means of bleeding the land of the polluting sea sapped away the ambiguity of the shoreline. The very identity of the sea altered. Once a proving ground for warriors, it acquired a new role as a hinterland, serving the interests of elites whose greater concern was the possession of estates and castles than mastery of the waves. Soon the sea would fall into the purview of scientists and navigators, their new mathematical arts enhancing and supplanting the ancient art of reckoning by observation of clouds, creatures, currents and celestial bodies. No less illuminating than the stars above were the mud and shingle below. Many sailors forsook the astrolabe and compass, which were fiddly, expensive and prone to error, but no ship would leave port without a lead and line, a hollow lead bell filled with tallow at the end of a long rope. By lowering the bell to the bottom of the sea and retrieving it, a captain knew both the depth of the water beneath him and the constitution of the seabed. Given the ephemeral appearance of the surface, these gave a more reliable indication of location than any other available clues. A convoy of allied ships sailing in the North Sea in 1943 (Getty Images) By the late 17th century, the navigator Captain John Hammond was able to give the ""Directions To Be Observed Going and Coming From Norway"" in around a dozen blunt but comprehensive sentences, half of one of which follows: On ye North edge of Well Bank, if you have 28 fathoms of water, stony ground, without you be Easterly, the SW part ye same and 12 and 13 fathom, but on ye middle of this bank, 17 or 18 or more depth, sometimes fine sand and other times coarse and black specks, ye soundings on this Bank being Variable but Steering East you deepen your water and sometimes meet with coarse ground and 27 and 28 fathoms water and then less before you fall off your east side between the Well Bank and white water, where you'll find at 24 and 25 fathoms nothing on the lead… If the bearings are approximate, the descriptions of the sea's bottom are almost tender in their precision. Of Swart Bank, he notes: ""The middle… is like oatmeal."" Other features are to be identified by their ""fine, yellowish-coloured sand"", ""fine, light-coloured sand"", ""muddy foundings"", ""darkish rock"" or ""whitish sort of foundings mixed with yellow particles"". Intricate as this knowledge of seabed's anatomy may have been, it provided little defence against human dangers such as were presented by pirates and, in the 16th-century, Watergeuzen or ""sea beggars"". These Dutch, aristocratic adventurers were rallied by William of Orange to the cause of independence from the Habsburgs, and were rumoured to visit terrible things upon anyone they chanced upon possessing anything of value. The collapse of the Habsburgs' power in the Netherlands opened the door to a Golden Age that placed Amsterdam at the heart of north European culture. Bankrolling the gilded glory was a silvery but modestly sized fish – and that the Dutch still possess a culinary affection for the herring (which the English can scarcely stomach) is an acknowledgement perhaps of everything the nation owes it. The waves sparkled brighter still beneath the enlightened gaze of the 18th century, the sea acquiring a new, more abstract identity and a role as a source of pleasure and health – in essence, more than a mere resource, a conduit for trade or theatre of war, but as a thing in itself. Read more How 'Britain's Atlantis' could revolutionise how we see the past Around the same time, Europe was drawn to new markets and the promise of greater riches in the Indies, East and West, in North America and Sub-Saharan Africa. The North Sea remained at the hub, but of ever-spreading, concentric circles of wealth, power and possibility. Now the use of larger ships with deeper draughts relegated coastal towns with shallow harbours and channels to second-class trading posts or made them entirely redundant. Meanwhile, improved roads and canal networks spread like a mesh of capillaries throughout Europe, undermining the importance of the old sea routes. Communities that had relied on cultural and economic ties with their equivalents across the North Sea or along the coast began to look inland for markets. Smaller settlements dependent on trade, or on artisanal fishing from open boats or nets worked from the shore, could no longer compete with the bigger fishing towns with their large trawler basins and deep-water docks equipped for transporting by the railways – which brought also a new breed of seasonal migrant, the tourists with their bathing machines, dance cards and donkey riding, the descendants of whom continue to return in droves each summer. Shades of light and dark, war and peace have dappled the North Sea ever since, inspiring thriller-writers, painters, poets, architects and visionaries of other kinds. Even in the face of cheap flights to ""sunny Spain"" and Phuket, we continue to chance a North Sea holiday. Freighters ply many of the same routes as the fluyts and cogs of centuries past. Fish, despite the gloomy auguries of scientists and conservationists, still spawn and shoal and are caught and grace our tables. True, the North Sea can be a lonely place. Just as the Mediterranean is garrulous, busy and bright even where its shores are empty, its North Sea counterparts tend towards the sombre, the still and the stern, even where trampled by happy summer crowds. For all that, I reasoned in conceiving my book, it scarcely deserves our indifference. Other seas may be more photogenic, more televisual, their ports and harbours exotic and sensual, but was it fair to permit the North Sea to become unfamiliar through being overfamiliar? What did I know previously of the courtship rituals of the island of Föhr, the tragedies inflicted upon Heligoland, the mysterious language of Norn, the genius of the Ostend painters, the trials and tribulations of the German Warft [artificial mound] dwellers, who each year confront the power of the Sturmflut [storm surge], or the boozy pleasures waiting behind the portals of the Nordern Lights Pub? Indeed, what had I experienced hitherto of the magic of a winter's evening in the marshes of the estuary of the Thames, from where I set out, by bus, boat, bicycle and train to explore the sea that lay beyond? And what epicurean delights would I have never known, had it not been for an omelette chewed to the beat of the pitch and yaw of a Swedish-bound freighter, as it skirted the Dogger Bank? This is an edited extract from 'The Naked Shore: Of the North Sea' by Tom Blass (£20, Bloomsbury), out now"
TOP GEIR,Norway,"Nigel Thompson is mesmerised by a cruise to Norway's fabulous fjords Glaciers, waterfalls and amazing food Cruising can be confusing. I'd set the alarm for halfpast very early to see the spectacular Geiranger fjord in Norway at dawn. My route from our comfortable balcony cabin to the sun deck on the P&O; ship Azura took me past the entrance to the gym, just as it was opening. A tidal wave of lithe, lycra-clad humanity swept past me, eyes fixed on nailing their favourite treadmills... Not your usual youthful gym bunnies, either. No, this was a phalanx of toned pensioners, their grey hair in fluorescent bands or tanned balding pates glowing under the ceiling lights. Where were the younger passengers? There were plenty on board -Azura is an excellent, family-friendly ship that appeals to all ages. The answer seemed to be that the younger passengers - including some bleary-eyed teenagers who I suspected had not yet been to bed - were on the sun deck already snapping away at Geiranger and happily capturing the views on smartphones, tablets and some seriously impressive cameras. And why not? It's an astounding Unesco World Heritage site. One of the most beautiful places you'll see - a grand winding chasm of tumbling waterfalls and soaring slabs of imposing mountain, occasionally dotted with little houses, usually with a traditional Norwegian grass roof, clinging almost impossibly to the near-vertical sides. In fairness, the senior keep-fit fans would still see much of the fjord from their treadmills... and they'd be a darn sight warmer than I was too! However, a hot cup of tea or two was easy to find and who would want to miss five sunrises? Why five? Because as Azura sailed on, the gullies and channels hewn in the sides of the fjord meant the sun kept disappearing and reappearing, each time sending new golden bolts of dawn light across the still, deep blue water. Magical moments. This scenery that My wife Debbie and I knew we'd experience the wonders of the fjord again on the sailaway that evening (it indeed delivered in spades), so on arrival in Geiranger, a tiny village, we left Azura for a can't justice six-hour coach excursion into the mountains. This turned out to be one of the best trips off a ship we've ever done, thanks to the kind of scenery that your photos simply cannot do justice to, and Daniel, our particularly engaging and informative guide. Geiranger has a permanent population of only 230, but in a four-month summer cruising season there are up to 240 ship visits, making it temporarily Norway's third port after Oslo and Bergen. was photos Cruises have been coming here since the late 1800s, but Daniel said that the days when six modern vessels visit is a bit too much with up to 12,000 visitors descending on do to the village, and their tour buses clogging the tiny mountain roads. However, of course, the locals need the tourists' cash so it's not an easy matter to balance. The bus headed ever higher into the mountains inland from Geiranger - which itself is around 50 miles from the sea - and climbed steadily until we were at 4,000ft, among substantial patches of snow. We stopped by one of these for the novelty of throwing snowballs in mid-August while wearing shorts and T-shirts in the delightful 28C sunshine. After a good lunch of salmon at a roadside hotel, the coach took us up to the viewpoint at Mount Dalsnibba. Here, from almost a mile up, you get an extraordinary view of Azura down in the fjord. Bear in mind the ship is the size of a skyscraper, yet moored on buoys in the vast fjord she looked a mere tiny white block. If you could imagine a piece of chalk floating in a half-filled bath of deep blue ink, that's about the scale. We'd started our cruise in Southampton and the stress-free parking at the port set the tone for our trip. You just drive up to the terminal, hand over your bags (you next see them in your cabin), your vehicle is driven away to a secure car park and you head to the embarkation area. Day two would be a relaxing time cruising up the North Sea and spent reading, spotting other cruise ships and all shapes and sizes of oil rigs, and generally mooching (cruise ships are fine places for some general mooching). Of course, on a cruise ship there's always some good food to be had and over the week we worked our way round Azura's various dining options. The cover charge Epicurean was consistently superb with the highlight being fabulous duck three ways, along with some amusing offerings such as a delicious dessert which looked exactly like lipstick and a fried egg. But the star of our week was the Indian cuisine in cover charge Sindhu, created by Atul Kochhar. A cornucopia of curry. That said, all the included meals we had in the buffet and main dining restaurants did not disappoint either, and bar drinks are at the prices you'd find in south-east England pubs. Compared to some other cruise lines, that's decent value. Less good value though was our excursion at Stavanger, the first port of call. A hourlong train ride to Egersund for a brief wander around the modest town centre and a dull coach ride back was fairly underwhelming. SUN AND SNOW the gorgeous We wished we'd stayed in Stavanger itself for a look round there, and taken in the Norwegian Oil Museum - apparently much more interesting than it sounds. Thankfully, the excursion at our next call was much better. There's little to see at the village of Skjolden - which sits at the head of the Sognefjord, the world's longest fjord at 127 miles - but we thoroughly enjoyed the scenic coach ride to view the Nigardsbreen arm of the massive Jostedalbreen glacier. Although thanks to global warming, it's not as massive as it once was. It's still mighty impressive though, at 37 miles long and up to 2,000ft thick, as was the 700ft cascade of the Feigumfossen waterfall on the way back to Azura. Geiranger and glacier bucket list boxes very firmly ticked, our last call was at Bergen, Norway's second city. It's in an attractive hilly setting and the city centre, with its colourful fish market - yes, that is Minke whale meat sausage, legally culled according to the stallholder - and wooden Hanseatic buildings, was just a short stroll from the cruise port. There are various shore excursions in Bergen, but it's really so easy to go DIY. Before exploring the centre, we headed to the funicular railway up the 1,000ft Floyen hill. Here you get the fabulous full monty view of Bergen, and it's justifiably one of Norway's most-visited attractions. ( floyen.no, £6.50 return) That evening's sailaway again tossed glorious scenery and an equally fantastic sunset into the mix, helped hugely by Bergen not living up to is reputation for being the rain capital of Scandinavia. As Azura bore steadily southwards across the North Sea on our journey back to Southampton, we again spent our sea day on some more extensive general mooching and a bracing stroll or two round the open decks.

Some aspects will always be unpredictable, of course. One of my most memorable trips was to Bruges one December. I’d booked it because it was incredibly cheap, but the night I arrived it snowed heavily and I awoke to a city of pristine beauty. The chances of repeating an experience like that are minuscule. But while the weather is never reliable, intelligent planning nearly always brings dividends. • 20 destinations you must visit in 2016[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/12063983/20-destinations-you-must-visit-in-2016.html] Below, I suggest a destination for each month of 2016, based on when you will find it at its very best. There is no Paris, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be high on your list. It’s a city for all seasons, and in the wake of the November attacks is likely to be pleasantly quiet – and it needs your business. Nor have I included Rome. Although it’s one of my favourite cities, it is likely to be extremely busy because the Pope has declared this to be a jubilee year. ""While the weather is never reliable, intelligent planning nearly always brings dividends"" I also suggest a Telegraph Travel recommended hotel for each place, plus a link to lots more advice and suggestions on our website. Prices are indicative only. They change according to season, demand and day of the week. For major festivals in Venice, Seville and Siena, book now for the best rates. The same goes for air fares, examples of which are taken from skyscanner.net, the best place to research flights from the UK. January: Venice for the Carnival You don’t have to attend one of the grand balls to enjoy the atmosphere in the streets and on the canals during the carnival[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/venice/10618698/Venice-carnival-guide.html] – and it’s hard to find a better stage for a party than Venice[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/italy/venice/33581/Venice-city-break-guide.html] . The festivities began this weekend and continue until February 9. Usually, it is extremely hard to get good accommodation during the celebrations, but perhaps because Shrove Tuesday falls so early this year there is still some availability at several of our recommended hotels. For example, as we went to press, the excellent Hotel Metropole (below) on the Riva degli Schiavoni was discounting rates by 30 per cent. There are plenty of flights, too – from as little at £80 return if you pick your times carefully. Stay at: Hotel Metropole.

It’s also the cheapest time to bag a good deal in a hotel. Next month sees the opening of two top exhibitions - Delacroix at the National Gallery (February 17-May 22; nationalgallery.org[http://nationalgallery.org] ) and Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse at the Royal Academy (January 30-April 20; royalacademy.org.uk[http://royalacademy.org.uk] ).

Throughout the day and long into the night, the narrow streets heave with people. You might have to wait 20 minutes just to cross the street, while one of the long, slow processions of hooded penitents following a paso (the heavy, highly ornate “float” bearing images of Christ or Mary) passes by en route to the cathedral. But you don’t feel inconvenienced – just part of it all. The vast majority of these crowds are not tourists, but locals celebrating a living tradition. This looks like a great year to grab an opportunity to see it; as with the Venice carnival season, bookings are surprisingly quiet this year, with plenty of accommodation still available, especially during the middle of the week (March 20-27). Stay at: The Alfonso XIII Hotel[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/alfonsoxiii] is brilliantly located near the cathedral and a great retreat if you are overwhelmed by the crowds. It still has availability midweek.

The medieval streets and squares of the Lower Town – especially around Grand Place – are a reminder of its status as a historic trading city. Once the residences of wealthy traders, they now house some of the city’s best and most famous restaurants. This is a great destination for a foodie break – and for culture too. The Musée des Beaux Arts has one of the greatest collections of Old Masters anywhere, including key works by Bosch, Bruegel, Rubens and Rembrandt. The wonderful collection of Magritte’s surrealist masterpieces, and the new Fin-de-Siècle museum, celebrating the city’s Art Nouveau traditions, are housed in the same building. April brings not only the spring weather, but Art Brussels ( artbrussels.com[http://artbrussels.com] ) – one of Europe’s biggest contemporary art fairs (April 22-May 24). Stay at:Hotel Amigo[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/hotelamigo] is an excellent Rocco Forte hotel in a (much improved) former prison in the city centre. From £146.

Thanks to the low-cost airline Norwegian ( norwegian.com[http://norwegian.com#nf] ), airfares are at historic lows too. So this is the year to plan a trip, and the long warm days of May are prime time to enjoy its many attractions. It makes for a great cultural short break. The National Gallery has an excellent collection, as does the Edvard Munch museum. The fabulous new opera house which sits on the water’s edge offers top-notch productions at bargain prices, while opposite it across the harbour the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art has a spectacular new extension by Renzo Piano.

So far we have seen mostly winter scenes, but St Petersburg[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/russia/st_petersburg/35373/St-Petersburg-city-break-guide.html] also comes into its own during the White Nights festival in June, when the sun barely sets and the city revels in the long, light evenings. At the heart of the festivities is the Mariinsky “Stars of the White Nights” season of world-class ballet and opera ( mariinsky.ru/en[http://mariinsky.ru/en] ), but this is also carnival season, and there is a grand firework finale over the River Neva to round things off. The exact dates haven’t been publicised yet, but are usually around June 11-July 2. With the rouble languishing on the foreign exchange markets, the city also offers excellent value at the moment.

The days are long and hot (24C is the average peak temperature in July) and the whole population appears to be on one long holiday. The outrageous Love Parade is no more, but you can enjoy a much more civilised party among the parterres and glasshouses of the The Botanic Garden in Dahlem. On July 16 there will be illuminations, concerts and a huge firework display to round off the evening.

It also has the Palio[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/10718886/The-Siena-Palio-how-to-see-the-race.html], one of those rare phenomena – a centuries-old tradition that has retained its vitality and its roots in the community. The bareback horse races take place around the central square, and the processions and the dinners held by the competing “contradas” (districts) fill the surrounding streets. There is passion, atmosphere and a real sense of excitement. The races take place on July 2 and August 16, with rehearsals on the preceding days.

Not only have these been splendidly restored, but much of the historic riverside quarter has had a makeover too. Now the focus is shifting on to the city’s other great assets – its food, and a new way to appreciate its wine. Last year Gordon Ramsay took over the restaurant in the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux, and Joel Robuchon opened a new restaurant, La Grande Maison, in 2014. In May this year a specatular new museum celebrating the history of what we call claret – the Cité du Vin – will open.

Russia Ready for Development of Joint Economic Projects in Arctic - Lavrov,Norway,"MOSCOW, January 25 (Sputnik) - Russia is open to the joint implementation of large-scale projects in the Arctic region in accordance with strict environmental safety standards, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. ""We are open to joint implementation of large-scale projects in the region, including in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. This refers, in particular, to the development of oil and gas fields, the use of the Northern Sea Route as the shortest cargo transit route between Europe and Asia, and the development of industrial, transport and tourist infrastructure,"" Lavrov said in his article for the Shared Voices magazine on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Arctic Council. He pointed out that the economic development of the Arctic region must be pursued in compliance with the highest environmental standards, as well as with due respect for the people living in the region and their traditional lifestyles. The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the governments of the Arctic countries. The forum comprises eight Arctic nations, namely Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. In 2013, Moscow announced a strategy to bolster its presence in the Arctic and boost the region's development by 2020.  "
QUANTUM LEAP: The Arctic is opening up despite warming fears,Norway,"Just a month ago, the world was celebrating the deal hammered out during the Paris round of climate change talks. Now we are inundated with reports of extreme and erratic weather events, and their possible connection with climate change. It is official that India was significantly warmer in 2015 than the normal, with the annual mean surface air temperature averaging 0.67C above the long-term average, making 2015 the third warmest year on record. The blizzard in America has disrupted life, and some scientists have blamed it on anomalies in a phenomenon called Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which is partly caused by the warming of the seas due to greenhouse gas emissions. Hong Kong and parts of South Korea have seen heavy snowfall this past week. As regards the polar caps in the Arctic, there is sufficient evidence of permanent ice cover shrinking. Since the Arctic is central to global weather patterns and the long-term warming trend, it has been under the scanner of scientists and policy makers for some years. However, the Arctic discourse now appears to shift from environment to economy with countries in the polar region getting prepared to adapt to a warmer Arctic. This is the impression I got while listening to experts and leaders of indigenous communities from the Arctic region at the ongoing Arctic Frontiers conference in Tromso, the Northernmost town of Norway. While the reasons for warming and shrinking of ice cover are perhaps global, the impacts will be first felt locally. The melting ice is opening up opportunities ranging from tourism to natural resource extraction in the region. Politicians as well as community leaders are in favour of exploring these opportunities. “Possibilities of new trade routes and extraction of natural resources are opening new doors in High North, but the challenge is to strike a balance between environment and commercial interests,” pointed out Borge Brende, foreign minister of Norway. About 10 per cent of the country’s population lives in the Arctic Circle, and 90 per cent of its exports come from sea-based economic activity. “Human dimension in the Arctic discourse has been neglected so far, as if the Arctic is a wildlife sanctuary. The world must realise that it is much more than icebergs, ice sheets and wild animals. People here have traditions, knowledge and skills, and they should be involved in any discourse about future of the Arctic”, felt Vittus Qujaukitsoq, minister for natural resources and foreign affairs of Greenland. It is felt that development of the oil and gas industry, tourism, mining and fisheries can help boost the livelihoods of four million people who live within the Arctic Circle. But given the high environmental costs and the fact that oil prices are very low, it may not make economic sense to exploit oil resources in the Arctic in the present scenario. Meanwhile, polar countries are preparing the ground for the future as more and more areas of the Arctic sea become navigable and accessible. Why India needs a polar vessel: India has been pursuing research in polar regions for more than three decades, but its focus has been on the Antarctica. The interest in the Arctic is relatively new. Now India has a research station in the Arctic in Norwegian territory and is also an observer in the Arctic Council, a body of counties around the Arctic sea. Several other countries, including China, have the observer status and are rolling out ambitious research programmes. China has its own ice breaker and polar vessels. India too has been planning to buy a polar vessel that can cater to the needs of Indian scientists in both the poles, but the matter has been hanging fire for more than two years. “Our engagement with the council is very important because what happens in the Arctic has an impact on weather patterns in South Asia including the summer monsoon. This engagement should be deepened by bringing more assets like a polar vessel to the table,” feels N A K Browne, former IAF chief and India’s ambassador in Norway. He suggests that India should acquire a polar research vessel soon as it will boost its research efforts in the Arctic and also further strengthen its position in the council as an observer. Clearing the air on Khesari Dal Khesari dal, which was banned for causing cases of a neurological disorder called lathyrism in the 1960s, has hit the headlines again due to new varieties of it developed by agricultural researchers. It has been claimed the new varieties are toxin-free. This raises questions of whether the disease has changed its pattern or the seeds of Lathyrus sativus have become toxin-free. Even when this pulse remained banned it was being consumed in some parts of India. I visited villages near Nagpur in the early 1990s and met people who were consuming this dal. Is it that the disease has changed its profile, or the body’s defence against toxins of lathyrus has got genetically modified? Dr Vijaya Nath Mishra, professor of neurology at the Banaras Hindu University, conducted a field study a couple of years ago to assess knowledge, attitude and practices relating to khesari dal. “We observed that lathyrus intake is common in eastern Uttar Pradesh and also in adjoining parts of Bihar, because of its low cost, easy cooking and typical taste. Of 500 people surveyed, 100 were regularly eating khesari dal and 82% of them did not report any illness related to the nervous system,” says Mishra. Junk food tax to cut childhood obesity WHO’s commission on childhood obesity has concluded that many children are growing up in environments that encourage weight gain and obesity. The marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages has been identified as a major factor in the increase in numbers of children being overweight and obese, particularly in the developing world. The report released this week has asked governments to discourage intake of unhealthy foods and colas through effective taxation and curbing the marketing of such foods, along with promotion of physical activity."
An opportunity lost: the case of Larnaca port,Norway,"By Reginos Tsanos The global economy is in turmoil. Large economies are teetering on the brink of collapse. There is volatility across all markets and sectors. The world has borne witness to billions of dollars’ worth of assets and securities being wiped out in just a single day of trading. The Eastern Mediterranean, once a haven for cruise liners, is now a station for warships and aircraft carriers patrolling trouble spots in Syria, Lebanon, and Libya. Cyprus has been through its own troubles as well. The events that unfolded in March 2013 shook the foundations of everything that was built, particularly in the post-1974 era. But as the government readily informs us that we are ready to exit our economic stability programme, and return the country to growth, there are some events that point worryingly to the fact that we have failed to heed the lessons of the past. Indeed it seems that we have not grasped one of the most important warnings from those events – that this was not just a financial crisis, but a much deeper problem, rooted in our behaviour, culture and practice, and not something that can be remedied simply by reforms on paper. The Larnaca Municipality’s decision to reject the request for an extension of the use of the town’s port for support base operations in Cyprus’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a case in point. A quick glance at the bigger picture helps emphasise its importance. Contrary to global developments, most notably the drop in oil prices, in the last few months a number of major international energy companies have given the Eastern Mediterranean a vote of confidence, publicly pronouncing their interest to engage in hydrocarbon exploration activities in the region. These companies include those that have been active in Cyprus’ EEZ, with ENI and TOTAL signing extensions to their contracts with the government for this exact purpose. Their enthusiasm however has not been met with the analogous response. In fact, quite the opposite. ENI, TOTAL and Noble Energy – on whom we are waiting with bated breath to finalise its development plan for the Aphrodite field – have all invested significantly in developing Larnaca port as an onshore logistics base for the oil and gas industry. A large number of industry experts concur that, for a variety of reasons, Larnaca port is the most appropriate location. Unfortunately, these companies are continuously receiving proverbial ‘slaps in the face’. And now, following the Municipality’s latest decision, will go back to the uncertainty and ambiguity emanating from the government, and specifically the Ports Authority, on the location of the onshore base. The two that have been touted, an area within the Sovereign British Bases adjacent to Limassol port, and the industrial area of Vasiliko, are unworkable in the short and medium term, as final approval of either would need to circumvent the maze of government bureaucracy. At the same time, a campaign of misinformation about the environmental impact of onshore operations on Larnaca and the local environment, perpetuated by irresponsible politicians who have placed their own narrow self-interests ahead of the greater good, has taken root in the minds of local residents, with the government taking the role of a mere spectator in the events that unfolded. In the midst of all of this, Larnaca port remains quiet and idle, its tourism product in decay, and having received another blow after the Zenon consortium failed to propose a viable leisure harbour project. The potential for economic growth is and will remain huge, and Larnaca could flourish similar to other cities across Europe, such as Stavanger in Norway, Aberdeen in Scotland, and Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. It is almost redundant to mention once again that the full-scale development of the industry in Cyprus will help in reviving important sectors of the Cypriot economy, creating new job opportunities for a depressed labour market, with unemployment still hovering close to 15 per cent. Important decisions that relate to the future of Cyprus should not be left at the whim of petty politics, nor should they fall foul of electoral campaigns, diminishing our credibility as a country and our reliability as an energy partner. It is now imperative that the government displays the will and determination necessary to come good on its much-touted plans to develop Cyprus as an energy hub. Particularly in light of its active energy diplomacy abroad, the government should also capitalise on the political instability in the Eastern Mediterranean and pursue the development of an onshore logistics base to serve the oil and gas industry, not just for Cyprus but also for the wider region. In the prevailing global economic environment, there are two things that investors value the most: security and reliability. The Larnaca port fiasco is yet another indication that we are running the risk of scaring off foreign inward investment. The energy industry will bounce back, and by that time we will have missed the boat.

Migrants find refuge 'north of the middle of nowhere',Norway,"HAMMERFEST, Norway _ After hiding below the horizon for two long months, the sun has finally risen in Hammerfest, casting a pale pink hue over the Arctic landscape surrounding the world's northernmost refugee shelter. From her modest room, Huda al-Haggar admires the wonderland of snow and ice, a sight so different from her native Yemen, where a Saudi airstrike destroyed her home, forcing her to flee with her young son. ""It's wonderful when I wake up in the morning and see this picture, the sea and the mountains. It's a wonderful place,'' the young woman says as 5-year-old Omar plays with Lego on her lap. The wooden barracks where al-Haggar and her son live used to house oil workers until Europe's migrant crisis reached the jagged shores of northern Norway, where the continent drops dramatically into the Arctic Ocean. Waiting for their asylum claims to be processed, hundreds of people in emergency shelters in Hammerfest and neighbouring towns are slowly getting used to the extreme climate and unfamiliar customs of the High North. They say they have adapted to the cold _ the temperature rarely drops below minus 10 degrees C (14 F) along the coast, though it gets much colder further inland. It's the darkness that throws them off. Rami Saad, a 23-year-old Syrian from Damascus with a neatly groomed beard and tight slacks, says workers at the Hammerfest centre warned him about the polar night but he didn't believe them until late November, when ""suddenly there was no sun.'' The lack of daylight messed up his body clock, like the day when he rolled out of bed at 11 and ambled to the cafeteria to have lunch. ""But there was nobody there,'' Saad says, giggling. ""It was 11 p.m.'' Few of the asylum-seekers expected to end up here, 280 miles (460 kilometres) north of the Arctic Circle, when they left their homelands in the Middle East, Africa and Asia to escape violence, poverty, forced marriages or armies they didn't want to join. Some were relocated by Norwegian authorities after entering the country from Sweden in the south. Others blazed a new trail into Western Europe by first entering Russia and then crossing its Arctic border with Norway. More than 5,000 people, mostly Syrians and Afghans, used that route last year before the government tightened the border in November and started deporting those who were not deemed to be in need of protection in Norway. Though that's just a trickle compared to the 1 million people who entered Europe last year from the south across the Mediterranean Sea, it forced Norwegian authorities to quickly set up migrant shelters in small towns separated by mile upon mile of untouched wilderness. In Alta, a scenic two-hour drive to the south, the Northern Lights Hotel was converted into a shelter for unaccompanied minors. On Seiland island, a nature reserve west of Hammerfest, Stig Erland Hansen was asked to temporarily house dozens of asylum-seekers in a remote lodge where he hosts adventure tourists during the summer. ""At first I thought it was crazy,'' Hansen says, clasping a cup of black coffee inside the main cabin. ""Is it possible to have people in darkness on an island?'' Not only was it possible, it was a big success, according to Hansen and Paal Mannsverk, who manages the camp, a cluster of wooden houses facing a pristine fjord. Reachable only by boat, the isolated location gives you a sense of being at the end of the world _ or as Mannsverk put it: ""north of the middle of nowhere.'' Yet the 36 asylum-seekers staying here, all but one from Afghanistan, seem surprisingly at ease. Hansen and Mannsverk say it's because they try to keep them active: fishing, chopping wood, sledding, skiing, and hiking instead of just sitting around waiting for a decision by the Norwegian Immigration Directorate, which can take more than a year. The camp on Seiland is a far cry from the crowded and jail-like migrant centres in some parts of Europe. Afghan children laugh and holler as they sled down the slope from the camp to the rocky shoreline, where men speaking Dari rinse fish caught in the icy fjord. Later, as the sun drops behind the mountains, they will cook them over an open fire with onion, tomatoes, eggs and spices brought in from the mainland. To some the contrast with the life they left behind is almost surreal. ""I was in Afghanistan, a country far away from here and now I'm in the north of Norway. I could never have imagined this,'' says 20-year-old Zakria Sedequi. He says he fled Afghanistan's Maidan Wardak province after the Taliban tried to recruit him. An ugly scar over his left eyebrow suggests they didn't ask nicely. Sedequi says they rammed the butt of a Kalashnikov rifle into his forehead. He documented the bloody mess with his cellphone camera. Inside the camp, 62-year-old Shukria Nawabi tears up as she recalls the hardship her family faced in Kabul. She has lived on Seiland since October with her husband, daughter and grand-daughter Helenar, a 7-year-old with pigtails, pink tights and a sheepish smile. ""We escaped from enemies in our life,'' Nawabi says through an interpreter, declining to delve into the details. Wrapped in a shawl, her daughter, Sufya, seems almost offended when asked whether the family struggled to adjust to the darkness on this desolate island. ""If you were in my place,'' she says, ""where bombs are going off in the street, where women are treated badly, and you come to this place, would you worry about the darkness and the isolation?'' A handful of young men who were transferred to Seiland didn't see it that way. They decided this wasn't the place for them, packed up their belongings and asked to be taken ashore. Some went back to Russia, where they had been studying. A couple travelled all the way to Italy, says Mannsverk. By the spring, the lodge will go back to its regular tourist business and the asylum-seekers will have to be transferred elsewhere, perhaps to permanent asylum centres like the one in Alta. The city of 20,000 has years of experience with integrating asylum-seekers into the local community. The staff at the Hero asylum centre in Alta try to prepare the newcomers for life in Norway by teaching them local customs, including how to treat women, a subject given particular attention after reports of mass sex assaults blamed on migrants in Germany on New Year's eve. ""Norwegian women can drink alcohol and be loud just like men. This is completely normal in Norwegian society,'' says Ingunn Soergaard, a petite woman with waist-length hair and a crystal-white smile. Her audience of 18 asylum-seekers, mostly from Syria, look at her with bewilderment. Not because they think it's weird that Norwegian women drink, but that Soergaard thinks they don't know that. ""We've seen that on TV. And we know that's how it is here. It's not an issue,'' says Anod al-Ali, a 31-year-old teacher from Syria. Soergaard's co-presenter, Goeran Johansen, decides to push the issue further. ""Let's say I'm meeting Ingunn for the first time and she invites me home to have sex,'' Johansen says. ""And then suddenly at home she says, 'No, I don't want to have sex.' What do you do?'' Some of the students shift awkwardly in their seats. Walaa Aziri, a 23-year-old Palestinian woman with a hijab turns bright red and hides her face in her hands. Finally, Ahmed Dawwas, a 36-year-old engineer who fled the Syrian city of Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold, breaks the silence by turning the question around. ""What if she invites me and I say no? How should she react?'' Dawwas asks. When the laughter dies down, he strikes a more serious tone. ""We have come here to live in peace,'' he says. ""We have fled war. We're not here to go after women. I don't understand why this has to be explained to all Syrians.''"
"Narvik, Norway: Welcome to Wolf Lodge",Norway,"""They’re here,"" announces Stig Sletten, breaking off our conversation as his eyes shift from mine to the window behind my head. I freeze, a glass of red halfway to my lips. ""You can look,"" he continues in a low, steady tone. ""But gently does it. No sudden movements."" I twist on my sofa and peer into the darkness. A shadowy canine shape enters stage right. As it trots into the light from our lodge, I see that this is no dog – at least, not one you’d ever find on a lead. The shaggy ruff, piercing eyes and brindled coat announce our nocturnal visitor as a full-grown wolf. Another soon arrives. The two touch muzzles, then pad on into the night. • 19 photographs that prove Norway is Europe's most beautiful country[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/galleries/19-photographs-that-prove-Norway-is-Europes-most-beautiful-country/] My companions and I are the first overnight guests in the Wolf Lodge. This innovative retreat opened in January inside Polar Park, an animal sanctuary one hour from the Norwegian[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destination/norway/130065/Norway-travel-guide.html] town of Narvik, itself about 140 miles (225km) inside the Arctic Circle. The wolves are not truly wild – wild wolves in Norway today are in short supply – but they roam huge enclosures in authentic mountain habitat. And certainly, as the howling starts up again outside our window, it is we who feel like the captives. The celebrated ""wolf kiss""Inside, the lodge is that peculiarly Scandinavian combination of spartan and snug, with an immense pine dining table, at which we tuck into a steaming bacalhau. We entered earlier via a tunnel, hidden from the wolves, and after dinner we don thermals and creep back outside for a face-slap of Arctic air and a shot at that other most elusive of Arctic celebrities: aurora borealis. • The world's coolest passport?[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/The-worlds-coolest-passport/] Up in these chilly latitudes, where winter temperatures regularly touch minus 30C, the Northern Lights are at their finest. Tonight, at a mere 18 below, we are able to remove gloves for just long enough to ready our cameras. ""Whack up the ISO and set your shutter speed to 10 seconds,"" advises Jonny Cooper, of Off the Map Travel, my tour operator. ""And don’t forget to focus on infinity."" I can just about control a camera, but cloud cover is another matter. As the snow continues to fall, our window on the heavens steadily closes. Aurora does her valiant best: for 15 minutes we watch flushes of pale green ebbing and shifting behind the clouds. It’s thrilling and mysterious, but I certainly won’t be showing anyone my photos. ""These widely demonised predators have a long history of persecution in Norway""After breakfast next morning we have a more personal date with the wolves. Few people know as much about these animals as Stig, who grew up in the mountains, and so we listen intently to his briefing. The wolves are ""socialised"" to accept humans, he reassures us, but we must not wear hats, gloves or anything else that might tempt inquisitive jaws. And if one comes close, we should crouch down, as standing tall might be construed as a dominance challenge. ""Don’t ever, ever, think they’re dogs,"" he concludes, firmly. • Lofoten Islands: With scenery like this, who needs the Med?[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/norway/articles/Lofoten-Islands-With-scenery-like-this-who-needs-the-Med/] And so we pull on protective overalls and troop apprehensively into the enclosure, close behind our wolf-whisperer and his assistant, Cattis Blomqvist, who has known these animals since puppyhood. The snow is falling hard and we sink thigh-deep into drifts. Stig cups hands to mouth and starts to howl. An enthusiastic response comes from somewhere beyond a ridge. Soon five wolves are trotting towards us. It’s an unnerving sight. The heads-down, single-file advance is the essence of predatory purpose and I’m glad I’m not, say, an injured musk-ox. But we crouch low and hold our ground. Sure enough, the wolves turn out to be delightfully curious. They sniff around the group, tails wagging, checking out each of us in turn. One approaches me directly. I lower my eyes to duck the steely yellow gaze and next thing I know it has its paws on my shoulders and is licking my face in the celebrated ""wolf kiss"".

And then they’re off again, swallowed by the blizzard. We follow for more photos and it is now, sharing their terrain, that I can fully appreciate the animals’ beauty: the lustrous fawn and ash-grey pelt; the noble, high-shouldered profile – the original dog template, before we came up with pugs and whippets. Sadly, not everybody finds wolves quite so impressive. These widely demonised predators have a long history of persecution in Norway. Today the wild population is reduced to a single pack of around 25, plus a few itinerant individuals along the Swedish border. Even now there are calls for a cull, with constant mutterings about livestock losses, despite compensation schemes. And it’s not only wolves: other local predators, notably lynxes and wolverines, are also under pressure. Landscape near NarvikThis is where the Polar Park comes in. Its mission is to educate locals and visitors about Arctic animals; to separate myth from fact and explain the value, both cultural and ecological, of preserving the nation’s natural heritage. ""After people meet our wolves, they leave with a different view,"" says Stig. With darkness falling, we zip around the rest of the park. Elk mooch below the pines, while lynx slink among snow-laden birches. Binoculars reveal reindeer on a distant hillside. ""The herders don’t like the wolves howling,"" says Stig. ""We’ve tried asking them to stop.” The next day I am back in Narvik. This picturesque town of 18,000 people was founded in the 1870s to service the Kiruna iron ore mine in neighbouring Sweden. Its location on the Ofotfjorden fjord offers the only year-round, ice-free port for this industry, so it quickly acquired a strategic significance that belied its modest size. In the Second World War, Narvik was the site of the first successful attack by Allied forces on the German army, which had seized the town. At Narvik Museum, amid assorted military artefacts and sepia photographs, I learn more about this famous conflict: how, on April 8 1940, the German navy invaded, sinking two Norwegian warships; and how, just days later, the British navy struck back, heralding an Allied ground campaign that swept over the mountains to liberate the town. By June 10, however, Narvik was back in German hands, as the British, now on the run in France, were forced to withdraw. For the rest of the war the town remained under Nazi control. It even housed a brutal concentration camp, in which thousands of Russian and Yugoslav prisoners perished. A memorial statue on the main street, depicting a woman bearing her child aloft, commemorates the Battle of Narvik, when the town’s inhabitants rowed out to the German battleships holding up their infants in a plea for mercy. Today the town is more welcoming. Visitors arrive in summer for midnight sun, mountain hiking and boat trips to the rugged Lofoten Islands; in winter, they come for ski slopes that plunge straight to the fjords and, of course, the Northern Lights. Tromso, even farther north, may be Norway’s Arctic tourism hub, but Narvik is certainly on the up: a winter festival later this month will find the residents dressing up, Amish-style, to celebrate its founding fathers – the navvies who built the railway – and a new bridge is rising over the fjord. ""Ice broken, the wolves cavort in the snow, accepting our cautious caresses. And then they’re off again, swallowed by the blizzard""From my cosy bolt-hole at the Quality Hotel Grand Royal, it’s a five-minute snowy trudge to Narvik station, from where I board a train on a day trip to Kiruna along the historic iron-ore railway line. I can’t say I’ve tried all the world’s train journeys, but I won’t dispute the tourist board’s claim that this is the most scenic. Certainly it’s a spellbinding ride, as we trundle high around the craggy contours of the fjord, ogling the towering peaks beyond. Over the Swedish border, the cragginess softens into undulations and the snowy terrain is studded with red hytter – mountain cabins beloved of summering Scandinavians. This line continues to Stockholm, but we dismount at the mountain resort of Bjorkliden, gateway to Swedish Lapland, where we tuck into marinated reindeer and are informed sotto voce by our Norwegian hosts that the view of nearby Lake Tornetrask, while pretty, has nothing on Norway’s fjords. Back in Narvik that evening, it’s time for another shot at the Northern Lights. A cable car deposits us at a lodge on the slopes of Narvikfjellet, where we find the twinkling town laid out gloriously below us, but, sadly, the clouds above us refuse to budge. No matter: nature never performs on demand. Instead of watching the aurora from the viewing deck, we sip champagne at the bar and learn about it through our charismatic guide Laila Nygard. She explains some of the science – charged solar particles, magnetic fields and so on – and entertains us with myths, legends and anecdotes. As a child, Laila had imagined that she could direct the lights with her waving. ""You’re here to get in touch with that little tingling feeling inside,"" she says. ""It’s something greater than science can explain."" The next morning, we put the mysteries of the night sky on hold and slip out of the harbour on a small boat to cruise the fjord. The docks and houses are soon left behind as we nose beneath icicle-encrusted cliffs and glimpse the imposing Lofotens at the fjord mouth. It’s hard to imagine this as the site of a naval battle – but the depths below us are, apparently, still littered with wrecks. The low winter sun illuminates a single prawn fisherman hauling in his nets, and the excited croaking of ravens draws our attention to a sea eagle, which takes flight from a dead tree and flaps heavily along the shoreline. .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: """"; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url(""http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png[http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png]""); background-image: url(""http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg[http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg]""), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}""We nose beneath icicle-encrusted cliffs and glimpse the imposing Lofotens at the fjord mouth. It’s hard to imagine this as the site of a naval battle – but the depths below us are, apparently, still littered with wrecks""“Eagles are beautiful, yes,” explains Lars Erik Niia, on my last night, as we sit around a blazing fire pit inside his lavvu – a Lap tepee. “But that’s not what I’m thinking when they kill my calves.” Lars Eric is a Sami reindeer herder. It’s a reminder that, for those who make their living from this challenging land, predator conservation remains contentious. The Sami are the original inhabitants of Arctic Norway, once herding their reindeer right across Lapland. Their traditions are ancient: Lars Eric shows me a reindeer-horn knife handle carved by his great-grandfather and we troop out into the snow to practise lassoing some antlers. But the Sami have also been quick to embrace modernity. We got here courtesy of Lars Eric’s snowmobile, which towed our sleigh through a fantasy snowscape while we, cocooned in reindeer-skin rugs, gasped as though entering Narnia. Now he demonstrates a phone app that catalogues the ear-tag markings unique to every reindeer herd in Lapland. ""We’re going to bring this aavdeer husbandry to our kids too,"" he says. Outside, the snow has stopped falling, the clouds have peeled back and the Arctic heavens are a canopy of stars. It’s my last night and – as though arranged to complete my story – the stage seems set for a celestial spectacular. But Lars Eric checks the aurora forecast on his phone and shakes his head: it’s not happening tonight. No doubt it will all kick off tomorrow, just as I am touching down at Gatwick. Never mind: skies and settings don’t come more magical than this. Aurora can wait. For now, I thrust gloves deeper into pockets, stare upwards and – as Jonny advised – focus on infinity. I’m even tempted to raise my muzzle and start howling.

NORDIC MORNING BRIEFING: Swedish Confidence Indicators in Focus This Week,Norway," TODAY'S CALENDAR - All times GMT  Nordic Macro 0800 Jan Denmark Retail Sales 0830 Sweden Riksbank Minutes  Other Macro 0200 Feb Japan PMI 0830 Feb Germany PMI 0900 Feb Eurozone PMI 1445 Feb U.S. PMI   IN FOCUS:  Focus in the Nordics this week will be on Swedish confidence indicators due on Thursday, which are expected to decline from record levels last month, after a rocky month for global markets. ""Given the market turbulence and increasing risks for global growth, it seems reasonable to expect a reversal of the January figures in readings ahead,"" says Handelsbanken. However, the closely-watched manufacturing component should still post a stronger-than-normal reading. Despite a rather weak global manufacturing business cycle in China and the U.S., Sweden's Riksbank is doing whatever it takes to keep the SEK weak, which supports Swedish exports and thus the manufacturing sector, Handelsbanken adds. European investors will turn their attention to key economic data Monday, while the impending referendum on the U.K.'s EU membership in June will also be at the forefront of investors' minds. Economists expect key business surveys to show the eurozone economy remained broadly resilient in the first half of February, despite increased turmoil in financial markets. According to a median of analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal, the monthly reading of the preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index, published by research firm Markit, will only be slightly weaker than January's. Activity in Germany and France, the single currency area's two core economies, was likely strong, forecasts show. In a weekly note released Friday, economists at Citi Research underscored that weakness in emerging nations and recent market jitters are likely to hurt export-oriented manufacturers, but argued the services sector is showing signs of robustness in the face of adversity. ""Rising household real incomes and fiscal easing brighten the outlook for public services, trade, tourism, real estate and entertainment, which account for two thirds of eurozone services,"" they said. ""A global recession would not leave the eurozone's domestic economy unaffected, but if domestic demand remains resilient some buffer is there.""

The reading shows the Swedish economy remains strong and Handelsbanken expects to see a decreasing unemployment rate throughout 2016. Labour market data has been of less interest for the Riksbank, which is still heavily focused on inflation expectations and the Swedish krona. ""However, with a strong economy and a booming labour market the Riksbank will gradually shift more focus into the labour market development and a subsequent pressure on wages in 2016.""  STOCK INDEXES:  OMXN40 -0.68% at 1410.7 OMXS30 -0.52% at 1355.95 OBX    -1.68% at 492.17 OMXC20 -1.18% at 962.7 OMXH25 -0.8% at 3090.72  Brent crude: +32c at $33.33   NORDIC MARKETS:  Nordic markets closed lower Friday as stocks gave back some of the week's strong gains. Oil prices also dropped, capping a rocky week that saw the price of Brent crude top $35 a barrel at times. But Friday's fall weighed on Norway's oil-heavy OBX index which saw the region's biggest losers. Across the rest of the Nordics, losses were broad-based but modest, though the defensive pharmaceutical sector bucked the trend and posted small gains on the day.   ENERGY:  Crude-oil prices edged up in early trade Monday morning but oversupply and slowing demand growth continue to weigh on market sentiment. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in March traded at $29.94 a barrel at 0202 GMT, up $0.30 in the Globex electronic session. April Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange rose $0.32 to $33.33 a barrel. Prices mainly advanced after industry group Baker Hughes reported the U.S. oil rig number fell by 26 to 413, marking the ninth straight week of decline.   NEWS ROUNDUP:  SWEDEN: Five people in the former management of bankrupt Swedish auto maker Saab Automobile AB (SAABF) are being prosecuted for a bookkeeping offense, Sweden's Economic Crimes Bureau said Friday. The chief prosecutor at the bureau, Olof Sahlgren, said three members of the Saab Automobile board and two former senior executives at the company are being prosecuted for gross obstruction of tax inspection. NORWAY: Statoil ASA (STO) said Friday it has awarded a 1.1 billion Norwegian kroner ($128.2 million) maintenance contract to Norway's Prezioso Linjebygg AS. The 10-year contract covers insulation, scaffolding and surface treatment maintenance services at the Sture and Kollsnes processing plants in Norway, it said. FINLAND: Finnish utility Fortum Oyj said Friday it is reorganising its corporate structure to enable the implementation of its new strategy. The new structure, effective from 1 April 2016, will consist of three business divisions called Generation, City Solutions and Russia. In addition, it will establish two development units that focus on growing new businesses.

What does our energy future look like? This new report offers a glimpse.,Norway,"What a difference a year makes. Just 12 months ago, in March 2015, oil prices had dropped to $50 — about half of what a barrel fetched the summer before. Oil producers were hurting, but they could also imagine that the markets would soon correct, the slide would stop and prices might rebound. Today, oil prices have been cut in half again, and there's no correction in sight. Demand for oil remains slack, thanks to the slowdown in the global economy and to policies aimed at cutting oil consumption. Supplies remain high while investment in production has crashed. For oil sellers and for the governments that rely on oil revenue, it's a nightmare. Cheap oil, they hope, will rekindle demand and the prices that suppliers can charge will rise again. They're free to hope. But over the past year, another striking trend has darkened the long-term outlook for purveyors of fossil fuels: serious policy on climate change. For nearly two decades, governments have been going to international meetings on climate change -- but not actually getting anything done. But that climate stalemate changed in December. That's when, in Paris, 196 countries agreed on a new approach to climate cooperation. The Paris agreement gives each country the flexibility to make its own pledge to cut emissions. The parties will periodically convene and review how well each country has done in meeting their pledges. These opportunities to check progress will smoke out the countries that are not making genuine efforts and could yield more cooperation over time. [interstitial_link url=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/01/wondering-whats-different-about-the-paris-climate-change-negotiations-heres-what-you-need-to-know/""]Wonder[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/01/wondering-whats-different-about-the-paris-climate-change-negotiations-heres-what-you-need-to-know/""]Wonder] what's different about the Paris climate change talks? Here's what you need to know.[/interstitial_link] This pledge and review approach is why Paris was considered such a success — and why climate policy is far more credible than it was a year ago. A new report released today by the World Economic Forum illuminates how the energy industry is already dealing with these diverging pressures. (Full disclosure: I am on the advisory board, although not responsible for the content of the report.) Ever since 2009, the forum team has been ranking each country on how its energy system performs across three dimensions: a) offering abundant energy to its citizens from diverse, secure supplies; b) reducing emissions of warming gases and other pollution; and c) making energy affordable so that economies can grow quickly. For decades, when most policymakers talked about energy policy they focused on just one of these dimensions: secure supply. They assumed that countries with the biggest supplies of oil, coal and gas were the most secure. But when you look at all three dimensions, the big suppliers actually do quite poorly. Many countries with the highest-ranked energy systems are actually big energy importers — especially importers of oil. They do well because they have diversified their supplies while keeping energy affordable and clean. The forum report also points to big tensions between the traditional concept of energy security and the need, as agreed in Paris, for the world to make deep cuts in emissions. Below are the rankings. Because the team has been using the same indicators for years, we can increasingly see trends over time, including in how countries rank. Three points stand out. 1. Countries with just a single source of energy have fallen in the rankings. That includes OPEC members. The most striking trends in the rankings, shown for the latest year in the figure, relate to countries that have not diversified their energy sources. Japan has tumbled 28 spots since 2009, mainly as a result of the ongoing troubles from closure of all the country's nuclear plants. A few plants are now restarting. At the same time, Japan now has much higher carbon emissions, which has dragged down the country's ranking. Nigeria's rank has fallen 26 spots — now at 108 — because the crash in world oil prices reduced the nation's revenues from fuel exports, cutting into GDP.

As a group, OPEC scores well on the traditional energy security indicator: the sheer supply of energy. But on other dimensions in the forum index — economic growth and environmental sustainability— their performance is abysmal. 2. Persian Gulf nations may be facing more political turmoil as oil revenue falls Last fall, the International Monetary Fund warned that countries whose leaders use oil revenue to stay in power might have trouble once that revenue drops. The figure below, also from the report, shows that all the big oil producers in the Persian Gulf are spending a lot more than they take in at current oil prices. The result may be more political turmoil. Around the world, the oil exporters that see disaster looming as prices drop are trying to reform. The changes needed are massive to open these economies to outside investors while also reducing economic dependence on the sale of oil — for example, through the promotion of manufacturing, services such as banking and tourism, and other activities that don't hinge on hydrocarbons.

It is also adopting reforms that will bring in foreign firms with capital and technology to improve how the countries looks for and produces oil and gas. 3. No country can do well on every measure — because energy policy involves tradeoffs. Some countries, notably the Nordic nations, have always scored well on the forum index because they have clean energy systems that are dominated by hydroelectricity and their economies are balanced. Some (notably Norway) are big energy exporters as well. [interstitial_link url=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/20/3-reasons-the-u-s-wont-break-with-azerbaijan-over-its-violations-of-human-rights-and-democratic-freedoms/""]Three[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/20/3-reasons-the-u-s-wont-break-with-azerbaijan-over-its-violations-of-human-rights-and-democratic-freedoms/""]Three] reasons the U.S. won't break with Azerbaijan over human rights violations[/interstitial_link] But almost no major economy scores in the top 10 of the forum's energy performance index shown above. The one exception is France, thanks mainly to reliance on low-emission nuclear power — a power supply that the French government is now trying to reduce. The problem here is that the world's various energy goals are in conflict. Security requires diversity. But some of the most promising technologies for cutting emissions could result in too much reliance on a single power source and other risks to reliability of the power system, as happened in Japan with nuclear power. Indeed, the countries that have done the most to keep emissions low have relied heavily on just one source of energy — often hydropower or nuclear power. Making those energy systems secure will require more diversity in supplies. Globally, wind and solar still account for less than 3 percent of the energy supply. Most countries that have made deep cuts in emissions have also relied heavily on electric power grids because it is easier to control pollution from large plants and deliver clean electricity. The latest reports from the IPCC, which have looked at how the world can make deep cuts in emissions in the future, have made the same point: a much cleaner world is probably a more electrified world. [interstitial_link url=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/04/why-would-a-president-wreck-the-economy-before-an-election/""]Why[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/12/04/why-would-a-president-wreck-the-economy-before-an-election/""]Why] would Venezuela's president wreck the economy before an election?[/interstitial_link] Over the past four decades, most of the debate over energy security has focused on oil. But the forum's report suggests that in the coming few decades, the pivotal problems for energy security will center around electric power. Electricity will bring issues that are quite different from oil-centered fears of energy security. Making electric systems more secure will require incentives to invest in large, expensive electric grids and to integrate new sources of power, such as wind and solar. It will also require dealing with new threats, such as the kind of cyberattacks that Russian hackers allegedly launched against Ukraine and which are looming for the rest of the world's power system.

"Great Escape: Longyearbyen, Spitsbergen, Svalbard",Norway,"Between Norway and the North Pole, the beautifully desolate archipelago of Svalbard promises complete escapism, Northern Lights sightings and polar bears The Svalbard archipelago, of which the largest island is Spitsbergen and the capital is Longyearbyen, lies midway between Norway and the North Pole. Any traveller looking for a true Arctic experience will find it here, and now’s a good time to visit because things are set to change. A few centuries ago, the only visitors to Svalbard were whalers and tough fishermen, but there are murmurings that the discovery of oil is imminent, and if that happens Svalbard will be changed irrevocably. Fortunately, this hasn’t happening yet and for the visitor, Svalbard is still a white, deserted and tranquil paradise, with Spitsbergen ideal for snowmobiling, husky trekking[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/luxury/travel/22226/something-special-husky-sledding-in-troms%C3%B8.html], skiing and, of course, observing the Northern Lights. For a taste of what life is like on an island hidden in the back of Europe’s freezer compartment, read on. Ceaseless winter, perpetual sun “Here comes the sun, little darling… it’s been a long cold lonely winter...” It is March 8, just after noon in Svalbard’s capital Longyearbyen, and The Beatles’ hit is being sung by a blonde girl wearing a sun-shaped crown on top of her woolly hat. It is bitterly cold – perhaps -4F(-20C) – and, wearing fingerless gloves, she is playing an almost frozen synthesizer as an audience attired in bulky snowsuits look on. They’re here for Solfestuka, Norwegian for “summer festival”, to celebrate the return of the sun. After four long months of polar winter, Longyearbyen is at last seeing the return of the first rays of warmth and with every passing day, the sun hangs slightly higher on the horizon. From this moment on, the period of sunlight increases by 20 minutes each day. The dim twilight that has engulfed Svalbard in recent months will now give way to pure, uninterrupted sunlight. By the end of March the island will once again enjoy a true sunrise and sunset; by late April the Midnight Sun will be visible and endless days will become common. Solfestuka may not be a riotous affair, but those who visit Longyearbyen at this time can’t fail to grasp the joy that accompanies those first, symbolic rays of sunshine. Arctic pleasures in Longyearbyen Despite the slowly budding tourism industry, tourism facilities on Svalbard remain rather limited – which is no bad thing – and conventional luxury travel options in Longyearbyen are virtually non-existent. Here, in Europe’s most northerly town, the Radisson Blu Polar Hotel[https://www.radissonblu.com/en/hotel-spitsbergen#nf] offers a hearty breakfast and a cosy bar, and uniquely Arctic dishes such as puffin carpaccio in the restaurant. Locals spend evenings eating out in the sophisticated Huset restaurant or drinking at the Funken Bar or Trappers Lodge bar, but visitors should make some time to venture out even if they must endure sub-zero temperatures. In winter, the Northern Lights frequently dance overhead. Barentsburg, the Russian Trojan horse Finn Flo, a handsome Norwegian (aesthetically occupying a space somewhere between Brad Pitt and a Viking), isn’t a tour guide, he says, but still he shows visitors the wild side of Svalbard on tours offered via Spitsbergen Travel[http://www.spitsbergentravel.no/start/#nf] . On snowmobiles, we travel with him from Longyearbyen to the village of Barentsburg 34 miles away. In fine weather it’s a three- to four-hour drive, depending on snow, wind and possible polar bear encounters along the way. (Residents who live in the countryside never venture outdoors without a gun to scare off predators, but only one human has been killed by a polar bear to date: an American tourist who in 1990 ventured a little too far out of town.) Riding a snowmobile sets the senses alight, particularly here where we’re cloaked in whiteness and the surrounding hills and valleys are almost invisible. Finn whizzes along at 40mph, around snowy hairpin bends, over the crackling surface of the frozen Arctic sea and up steep, icy hills. After hours in the wilderness, the cold finally starts to penetrate our nine layers of thermal clothing, but the end is in sight. A town bought long ago by the Russians for its now-depleted coal mines, Barentsburg is still populated by 500 or so Russians who survive the long winter thanks to borscht and vodka. They’ll probably never leave – this foothold into Europe is of great strategic importance to the nation – but the town feels deserted and looks sadly antiquated. Soviet murals adorn every wall, there are dreary apartment blocks and pitch-black smoke still belches from the old mine. It makes for a sad but fascinating tourist attraction, and the Russians are slowly opening up to visitors. The town’s hotel now boasts a bar and restaurant, and visiting Norwegians here make a point of picking up bottles of cheap vodka and sometimes stay overnight. But for us it’s back by snowmobile to Longyearbyen. We’re again approaching the capital when Finn stops and looks up. The Northern Lights flank the sky and flirt with the stars. He’s seen them innumerable times but still he’s captivated: “seeing them is a religious experience, believe me.” Getting there Spitsbergen is easily reachable thanks to SAS[http://www.flysas.com#nf] offering flights from Oslo[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/norway/oslo/articles/36-hours-in-oslo/] or Tromsø[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/norway/tromso/articles/36-hours-in-tromso/] to Longyearbyen. The island can be visited year-round, but the tourist season (if it could be called such a thing) starts when the light returns, around mid-March. For photographers, though, the best time is the ""blue period"" just beforehand. Visit then for fewer tourists, lower rates, frequent Northern Lights sightings and the chance to wander the region when daylight hours are washed in a beautiful bluish aurora. In pursuit of the ultimate travel happiness, journalist Debbie Pappyn and photographer David De Vleeschauwer venture tirelessly to the most beautiful corners of the world. Having already visited over 100 countries, they take an average of 100 flights a year and regularly write about their adventures for Telegraph Luxury and other prestigious publications internationally. They couple's own, award-wining website Classe Touriste[http://www.classetouriste.com] is a visual chronicle of those global adventures"
Algeria Oil Installation Attacked,Norway,"Unknown assailants fired mortars at a gas installation in Algeria on Friday, causing no casualties or damage but signaling that the country's oil and gas industry was still vulnerable to attacks by Islamist militant groups. Algeria's state-run media said the country's security forces were pursuing the attackers of the Krechba gas installation, which is jointly operated by Norway's Statoil ASA, BP PLC and Algeria's state-run gas company Sonatrach. ""As far as we know, Algerian security personnel have the facility under control,"" a spokeswoman for Norway's Foreign Ministry said. There was no claim of responsibility for Friday's attack, but suspicion immediately fell on armed Islamist groups operating in Algeria and neighboring Libya and Mali. Algeria's valuable oil and gas assets have been targeted before by Islamist militants. In 2013, fighters of an al Qaeda splinter group called al-Murabitun attacked the In Amenas gas complex near Algeria's border with Libya. The four-day stalemate that followed ended when Algerian security forces stormed the installation. Forty hostages, mostly foreign workers, were killed in the exchange of fire. In Amenas is also operated by Norway's Statoil ASA, BP PLC and Algeria's Sonatrach. Before he was killed in a U.S. airstrike last year, the leader of al-Murabitun, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, exhorted his fellow jihadists to attack oil and gas facilities in Algeria, the source of nearly 100% of the country's export revenues and an important source of profit for major Western oil companies. Krechba is a satellite operation of the In Salah gas field, about 750 miles south of the capital Algiers in the Sahara. In Salah is Algeria's third-largest gas field, with an annual production capacity of 9 billion cubic meters. Besides al-Murabitun, al Qaeda's Algeria-based North Africa affiliate, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, appears to be resurgent. It said its fighters carried out Sunday's assault on a hotel in Ivory Coast that left at least 15 people dead. Its rival for jihadist hearts and minds, Islamic State, is a looming threat, too. From its strongholds in Libya, it has established a foothold in Algeria's mountainous northeast, where it killed a French tourist last year, according to Western officials. ""Algeria is likely to witness more attacks on isolated oil and gas facilities,"" said Akrouf Chems, head of operations at the French consulting firm RensForm. Several radical groups, he said, ""want to destabilize an economy already hit by a fall in oil prices."" Following the 2013 In Amenas attack, Norway's Statoil said it had relied too heavily on the Algerian military for protection of its personnel and facilities. But Friday's failed attack suggests Algerian authorities have improved security at key oil and gas installations. A union representative at Sonatrach said security contractors were now armed and additional soldiers and police officers had been deployed by Algerian authorities at the installations.

"In oil price plunge, North Sea industry faces perfect storm",Norway,"ABERDEEN, Scotland _ It's Thursday night and the Spider's Web pub is packed with beefy guys in windproof jackets and massive backpacks. The exhausted oil rig workers pile their bags against the wall, play pool or just slump in the leather seats, knocking back pints of beer. But despite the drink, there's not much laughter. It's not work that bothers them, but the prospect that the work will end. ""I'm worried,'' says Fraser Jamieson, an engineer who has spent the past 20 years on North Sea oil rigs. ""We're all worried.'' The North Sea oil industry, the biggest and oldest in Europe, is struggling with a toxic combination of aging, drying wells and the recent plunge in oil prices, which is forcing companies to rethink investments and putting thousands of jobs at risk. Estimates suggest more than a third of some 330 oil fields in the U.K. North Sea will close in the next five years. ""There is a sort of perfect storm,'' said Dorrik Stow, director of the Institute of Petroleum Engineering at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland. ""Those cumulative factors are going to negatively impact on the North Sea unless there is a fairly significant upsurge in the price of oil.'' Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil, hit a 12-year low of $27.10 a barrel in January amid slowing economic growth in China and increased production in the U.S. That's down from more than $100 a barrel as recently as September 2014. While prices have recovered somewhat, Brent traded for about $42 on Friday and most experts don't expect a significant rebound soon. Low prices are causing turmoil internationally in an industry that has been going through booms and busts ever since 1859, when the first drilling rig was built in Titusville, Pennsylvania. For the North Sea, each new bust accelerates its downward spiral, hurting the countries that tap it _ Britain, Norway and to a lesser extent the Netherlands. Norway on Thursday slashed interest rates in a bid to help the economy manage the oil sector's drop. In Britain, the government this week offered tax relief to oil companies to protect jobs and stem a decline in government income. Tax revenue from the industry dropped to 2.1 billion pounds ($3 billion) last year from 10.9 billion pounds in 2011-12. Some of the biggest platforms are being dismantled as the industry forecasts production will drop to 45 million tons of oil equivalent this year, less than a third of the 150 million tons produced in 1999. Shell, for example, has started the process of decommissioning the Brent oilfield _ which has produced 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent since 1976 and gave its name to the international crude oil benchmark. Oil companies are expected to invest about 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) in new projects this year, compared with a recent average of 8 billion pounds, industry association Oil & Gas U.K. says. And it is hitting workers hard. Some 5,500 people have lost their jobs, or 15 per cent of the 36,600 directly employed in the industry at the end of 2013, according to Oil & Gas U.K. The group estimates that total direct and indirect employment supported by the industry has fallen to 375,000 from a peak of 440,000. If the oil price remains around $30 a barrel for the rest of 2016, almost half of the North Sea fields ""are likely to be operating at a loss, deterring further exploration and capital investment,'' according to Oil & Gas U.K. ""2016 is going to be quite pivotal,'' said Fiona Legate, a research analyst at Wood MacKenzie. ""We will see distress sales, and it will be make or break for a lot of companies.'' The doldrums are evident in the port of Cromarty Firth, a small deepwater estuary near the Scottish town of Inverness at the back door of the central North Sea. In the past, the port usually housed two rigs at a time as they underwent periodic maintenance. Now it hosts 10 _ split roughly between rigs that are expected to be dismantled and those that are parked in hopes that higher oil prices will mean new contracts. It's tough for a community in which rig maintenance meant good jobs. The port's chief executive, Bob Buskie, believes this downturn is unlike others because there isn't likely to be a boom after the bust. ""We have to realize that what's gone on in the past is in the past, and for the industry to survive in the future the whole model has to change to some extent,'' he said. For Buskie that means getting work decommissioning the platforms once built and maintained in Cromarty Firth. It also means looking for new business. He's trying to attract more cruise ships packed with tourists who want to take in the delights of the Scottish Highlands, complete with bus tours of nearby Loch Ness and local whisky distilleries. ""There is a new normal,'' Buskie said. ""We have to find out what the new normal is.'' And in the period of transition, there is uncertainty for those who depend on oil for their livelihoods. In Aberdeen, the Scottish city at the heart of North Sea oil, restaurants are empty at lunchtime. Hotel parking lots are barren. Helicopters once busy ferrying workers are parked on the tarmac. It's common to hear conversations about people who have been laid off or are barely hanging on. Retired engineer Ken Forbes, 70, suggests the high-fliers made rich by oil are ""coming down to Earth with a big bang.'' At the cozy Sanddollar cafe on the Aberdeen seafront, the lunchtime crowd clears quickly despite the prospect of luscious lemon cake and hot tea. Waiter Piotr Kowalski, 23, said he's noticed that people are much more careful about what they order. ""They spend less,'' he said, noting the downturn. ""They don't go out so often in the first place.'' Tommy Campbell, a regional organizer at the Unite union's Aberdeen headquarters, sees the pain every day. Just last week one worker told him the entire team on his rig _ some 30 people _ had been put on notice for redundancy. He argues oil companies have responsibilities not just to shareholders, but to the communities that support them. He thinks a summit would be good to bring companies, politicians and the community together to think creatively about what's next rather than just cutting headcounts. At the moment, though, too little is being done to stem panic. ""We're throwing rattles out of the prams,'' he said. ""Everybody is losing out.''"
The have-not headaches are back,Norway,"Rick Farrell was among hundreds who lost their jobs in December when the shipyard where they worked finished making a gigantic module for Newfoundland and Labrador's fourth offshore oil field – Hebron. Unlike previous years when unemployed tradespeople could easily find work in Alberta, that was no longer an option with oil prices plunging. The layoffs hit Mr. Farrell's hometown of Marystown hard and rippled across Newfoundland's Burin peninsula, hurting the local businesses and small communities that dot the province's southern coast. “It was the biggest layoff we had in many years,"" said the 52year-old Mr. Farrell. “We could be a year without work in sight."" After riding the oil boom for more than a decade, Newfoundland and Labrador is facing a dire economy and a return to the days when it was the archetypal “have-not"" province. It's getting hit on all sides. Multibillion-dollar projects such as Hebron are either completed or close to completion. Iron ore mines are shuttered and the weak oil price has pushed the province's deficit to a staggering $2-billion – a record amount. And more pain is on the way. Tax hikes and job cuts are expected when the province unveils its coming budget. A fifth of the energy sector has been laid off and the misery has spread to other parts of the economy, from cabbies to waitresses. The unemployment rate is 14.1 per cent, the highest among the provinces. “It's just getting worse,"" said Bernie Johnson, a welder in St. John's who has been out of work for nearly a year. “Everything has dried up. There are more layoffs coming."" ‘Have-not will be no more' Ever since it joined confederation in 1949, Newfoundland and Labrador has been searching for a way to earn its keep. First came fisheries, which were decimated with the depletion of cod stocks and ensuing moratorium in 1992. Then there was Churchill Falls, a massive hydroelectric project that was supposed to provide untold wealth, only to end in a bad deal with Quebec. And then there was oil. “It was sold to you that this is the saviour,"" said Sean Wiltshire, 45, who has lived in Newfoundland most of his life and runs Avalon employment agency. Ingrained in Mr. Wiltshire‘s memory are the words from former premier Brian Peckford that “some day the sun will shine and have-not will be no more."" Billions of barrels of crude lie beneath the ocean off Newfoundland's shores. Over the two to four decades it took to turn the province's mammoth oil discoveries into production, the price of crude swung wildly. It traded around $30 (U.S.) a barrel in the early 1980s, dropped below $10 in 1986 and rose to more than $100 in 2014. Now it is trading around $40. The White Rose, Terra Nova and Hibernia offshore oil fields were already in production and crude was soaring when former premier Danny Williams fought Ottawa and the energy industry for a greater share of the oil revenue. The province went into overdrive after Mr. Williams and Exxon Mobil Corp. reached an agreement in August, 2007, to build Hebron – a $14-billion project. At the same time as Hebron was being developed, Vale SA's nickel processing plant in Long Harbour and the government's Muskrat Falls hydroelectric facility in Labrador were also under construction. To accommodate the hundreds of additional labourers, engineers and executives moving to St. John's to work on these projects, new offices, housing and restaurants popped up, including upscale restaurants and luxury condos with a view of the harbour. “When oil started to rise, everything was possible. New jobs, high-paying jobs. Things started to change,"" Mr. Wiltshire said. “People felt like we were playing catch-up. You had better opportunities when oil was higher."" The average weekly paycheque in the province rose 70 per cent to $991 (Canadian) over the boom years, higher than the national average. For miners and oil-and-gas workers, average earnings skyrocketed to $2,048 a week. People started migrating to the province for the first time in decades. The influx of workers boosted demand for housing: The average house price increased to $284,000 from $104,000 over the oil bull market, according to Canadian Real Estate Association data. “There would be bidding wars. Here. I mean I had never heard of that,"" said Elizabeth Lawrence, director of strategy with the City of St. John's. The decade-long bull market in oil and other commodities propelled the province into “have"" status in 2008 for the first time in its history. Instead of receiving payments from Ottawa to help pay for services, Newfoundland and Labrador started contributing to the equalization pot. Delinquent debt on rise Lofty oil prices overshadowed some early warning signs. A slowdown in the iron ore industry started a few years ago and one of Labrador's key iron ore mines was closed in 2014, putting hundreds of people out of work. Then as the price of oil dropped, companies and projects in the energy sector that had looked so promising were suddenly announcing layoffs and closings. Nearly 3,000 Newfoundlanders and Labradorians in the mining and oil industry lost work over the past year and a half and prospects are grim. Bernie Johnson has applied for nearly 200 jobs in and outside of his industry. “I still haven't got a phone call from nobody. It's bad,"" he said. A single father, Mr. Johnson said he is worried all the time. “Every day to every day you are looking at your bank account. Literally,"" he said. Mr. Johnson paid for his offshore oil training on the promise from a local company that he would get hired. But once he completed the training last summer, there were no jobs. Like many others, Mr. Johnson is facing rising debts. Delinquency rates on loans and credit cards rose 20.5 per cent in St. John's and 12 per cent across the province last year. Signs of the slowdown can be seen almost everywhere. On a recent February evening, the main street in downtown St. John's was desolate. Most restaurants were empty with servers hovering around the bar. Andrea Maunder, the owner of Bacalao, a downtown restaurant, said regular customers come in less and don't order as much. Christmas dinner parties became Christmas lunches. She has had to cut her staff's hours. Jackie Anderson, who has worked in the restaurant business for two years, said February is normally a slow month but not this slow. Now she sometimes doesn't get a single table for lunch. One of her regular customers used to order an appetizer, a main dish and a drink. Now he orders soup and water. She used to get 15 per cent in tips and recently had a customer tip her 7 per cent. “That's how bad it is,"" she said. Cabbies have seen their businesses drop by as much as half. One driver was out for 19 hours and made $3 an hour. Cabbies used to be able to count on more lucrative trips to the airport but those customers disappeared along with the direct flights between St. John's and Fort McMurray, Alta. “It's slow,"" said Don Butler, a cab driver for 20 years whose car was among a long line of taxis close to the popular bar-filled George Street. “People are not moving."" The condo market is also easing. Condos used to get snapped up as soon as they went up for sale, but many have been sitting on the market for months, including one replete with a wine cellar. One strip of dilapidated buildings was supposed to become a cluster of high-end condos. But one of the structures is now slated to become an apartment building and another is a parking lot. Throughout the city there are indications that construction has slowed: an empty hole that was destined to be a condo; a person taking down a sign for a gleaming building that was never built. Although house sales are up year over year, there is uncertainty in the air as Newfoundlanders and Labradorians wait for the province to unveil its budget. “People are holding off right now because of potential layoffs with the government,"" said Larry Hann, a real estate agent with Hann Group, which specializes in condos and houses. Mr. Hann is optimistic for the future because of the huge offshore oil finds, but said: “In a couple of years' time, unless we get another major oil project, there is going to be a lot of inventory sitting around empty."" Commercial real estate vacancy rates rose to 7.7 per cent last year from 4.8 per cent in the previous year, according to Turner Drake & Partners Ltd., an Atlantic Canada real estate consultancy. Seventeen new office buildings were erected and expanded over the past few years, including the addition of two shiny office towers in the downtown core the same year oil started to tank. “There was an increase in supply at the exact same time when the initial sense of a decrease in demand was occurring,"" said Charlie Oliver, a commercial real estate veteran of 35 years with Martek Morgan Finch Inc. Still, Mr. Oliver said he is not seeing a lot of vacant space because many of the big oil companies are locked into their leases for another year. “The biggest challenge is going to be in the large blocks of space which will be coming onto the market this time next year,"" Mr. Oliver said. “We are still at the stage of uncertainty rather than reality of what is going to be vacant."" A hit to provincial finances The recently elected provincial Liberal government is now scrambling to meet the dual challenge of stimulating the economy and reducing the deficit. Credit-rating agencies have downgraded Newfoundland and Labrador's debt and changed their outlook from “stable"" to “negative,"" which could eventually drive up borrowing costs at a time when the province has little spare cash. The credit agencies won't upgrade their ratings until the province improves its finances. “It is one thing to say that you are willing to or looking at making changes and another to actually implement the changes,"" said Michael Yake, senior credit analyst with Moody's Investors Service. The deficit is on track to balloon to $2.4-billion next year and will remain close to $2-billion annually for years if trends hold. About one-third of the province's revenue has traditionally come from oil royalties. That amount dropped to $551.8-million from $1.2-billion when the province updated its budget for fiscal 2015-16, due to weak crude prices and declining production from mature oil fields such as Hibernia. Finance Minister Cathy Bennett knows she doesn't have much time. She has spoken to the province's major lenders and bond agencies and said she has heard their message. “It is not an option for us to take two years to get to a credible plan,"" Ms. Bennett said in an interview in St. John's. “We have been very clear with the people of the province and with the bond-rating agencies that we intend to introduce a very credible plan as part of our budget."" The Liberals campaigned on the promise not to cut public sector jobs or raise the HST, which at 13 per cent is among the lowest in the Atlantic provinces. But since coming into power in December, the government has changed its tune. Now a tax hike and job cuts are expected. The provincial government has directed its staff to find ways to reduce expenditures by a third, a worrying scenario for teachers, civil servants and other public sector workers. “There's no way to avoid people losing their jobs,"" said Jerry Earle, the president of NAPE, the province's largest public sector union whose members include social workers and highway maintenance workers. Newfoundland's public sector comprises a quarter of the province's work force, higher than the national average of 20 per cent. The bulk of the 60,000 jobs are in hospitals, health care and social assistance, while the rest are in schools and the government. Like Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador will receive a cash infusion of $30-million from an emergency federal program designed to help provinces during sharp economic downturns. As for the more contentious “equalization"" payment, the province said it will not be receiving those subsidies any time soon because of a lag in the way the payments are calculated and administered. “It is worth a reminder that Newfoundland and Labrador does not receive equalization payments now,"" the province's Premier Dwight Ball said in an interview in St. John's. The other Atlantic provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, along with Ontario and Quebec, are still in “have-not"" status, due to the calculation lag. But because the formula for payments has already been set for the next few years, Newfoundland and Labrador will not qualify. “Of course we would like to see the formula changed so we can use that money to provide those benefits,"" Mr. Ball said. “But the future for Newfoundland and Labrador as we work our way out of this is not going to be receiving equalization cheques from Ottawa."" Exacerbating the situation is the province's vast land, sparse population and rapidly aging demographics. There is a fear that the fiscal mess will lead to another exodus, similar to what happened when Ottawa closed the province's cod fisheries in 1992. That year marked the province's peak population with 580,000 people. But the cod moratorium decimated fishing communities and Newfoundlanders fled to other parts of Canada looking for work. Most never returned and today the population is 527,000, with more than a quarter over the age of 60. In Burgeo, one of Newfoundland's many remote and tiny communities, two-thirds of the population is over the age of 55. It is common here for residents to drive 10 hours for a 15-minute doctor's appointment in the capital. During winter months, the only road to Burgeo can be closed because of white-out conditions. Burgeo's mayor is worried about the looming cuts. “Smaller communities require a bit of extra to provide services. Many times they are looked to to provide the cuts,"" said Barbara Barter, who volunteers as the mayor and used to work as a full-time teacher. And as services disappear, people leave. Sharlene Hinz, who runs Aunt Edna's Boarding House B&B; on Little Bay Island, is considering selling her bed and breakfast after the designated ferry to her island was cancelled. About 100 people – tourists included – live there during the short summer. Located off the northern coast of Newfoundland, Little Bay used to be one of the province's fishing communities. But its crab processing plant, which was the island's main employer, closed about five years ago. Then its only store disappeared along with its direct ferry. Without regular access, it now takes residents a full day to go grocery shopping. “I don't think the small communities should be closed. At the same time, without young people, that is what's going to happen. Everyone dies,"" Ms. Hinz, 62, said over the phone from Vancouver Island where she lives off season. There are two students and a teacher on the island of mostly senior citizens. Big projects wind down Although St. John's has a jobless rate of 7.6 per cent, the provincewide rate is 14.1 per cent, up from 12.3 per cent mid-2014. And the rate could go higher as major construction projects begin to wind down. Construction at Hebron and Muskrat Falls will be wrapping up over the next two years, which will lead to even more job losses. Hebron employed 5,300 at the height of construction and will need a fraction of that work force to operate the rig once it is in production in 2017. Vale hired as many as 6,000 people to build its nickel plant and now requires only 750 workers to operate it. Muskrat Falls employed about 5,000 at its peak and by the time it starts producing electricity in 2018, will only need about 70 people to run the equipment. About $30-billion will have been invested in the province to erect Hebron, the nickel plant and Muskrat Falls. The bulk of the funding for the electricity project was by taxpayers and it is unknown whether it will be profitable. “It's certainly a transformative project for the electricity market and important contributor to the Newfoundland economy,"" said Finn Poschmann, chief executive officer with the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council. “The probability of it being a profitable investment in the medium term for the province is dicey."" The province is waiting to see how the federal government allocates $60-billion in infrastructure spending in its budget on Tuesday, half of which was a campaign promise to help bolster Canada's sluggish economy. The Premier is hoping Ottawa will be flexible on how and where the money is spent. “It is important that we have infrastructure projects ready to keep our work force working,"" Mr. Ball said. The government and business community talk about diversifying the province's economy. They see many opportunities in agriculture, aquaculture, mining, forestry and technology, although they still envisage the province as a destination for oil companies. Tanks belonging to Irving Oil dot the picturesque landscape of St. John's and the offshore supply ships sit in the city's harbour, a constant reminder of the province's dependency on crude. The government and its residents are hoping for another big project. Statoil ASA, the Norwegian oil giant, and other big oil producers recently paid $1.2-billion to explore for oil in the Flemish Pass basin, which contains at least 12 billion barrels of oil and dwarfs the province's producing basin Jeanne d'Arc. Statoil recently found Bay du Nord, hailed as one of the biggest deep-water oil discoveries in decades However, a Bay du Nord project is far from a done deal. No one knows how long it will take to delineate the resource or how long it will take for oil prices to recover to a level where it makes sense to develop the Flemish Pass. “Yes we are in a little bit of doldrums that no one anticipated. Maybe in some ways, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy,"" said St. John's Mayor Dennis O'Keefe. But he added: “The future of Newfoundland and Labrador is very, very bright. Ultimately we will be the energy powerhouse of North America.""

Al Qaeda Claims Algeria Gas-Plant Attack; Militant group threatens further attacks on Western companies,Norway,"Al Qaeda on Saturday claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on an Algerian gas plant, threatening more operations against Western oil companies. Early Friday, attackers launched homemade rockets[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/statoil-says-algeria-project-hit-with-explosives-1458295882] at the Krechba gas plant, which is run by the U.K.'s BP PLC, Norway's Statoil ASA and Algerian state-run gas company Sonatrach. In statement republished by extremist monitoring group SITE on Saturday, al Qaeda's Algeria-based franchise al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the attack and threatened both the Algerian government and Western companies. The oil companies and Algeria's Defense Ministry said the attack on the facility, an extension of the In Salah gas field, about 750 miles south of the capital, Algiers, caused no casualties or damage. In Salah is Algeria's third-largest gas field, with an annual production capacity of 9 billion cubic meters. The incident signals the country's oil and gas industry is still vulnerable to attacks by Islamist militant groups. In its claim, AQIM said it would focus on shale gas—a technology where hydrocarbons are extracted using hydraulic fracturing on rock formations. Algeria, which holds the world's third-largest reserves of shale gas, is betting on the technology to revive its stagnating energy sector and has held talks to get assistance from Italy's Eni SpA and Exxon Mobil Corp. of the U.S. But the plans have triggered protests against in Algeria's Sahara, where locals fear environmental damage and the exhaustion of water reserves. Al Qaeda now appears intent on tapping this popular resentment. Algeria's valuable oil and gas assets—the source of much of its revenue—have been targeted before by Islamist militants. In 2013, fighters from an al Qaeda splinter group called al-Murabitun attacked the In Amenas gas complex [http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/SB10001424127887324624404578255503958509588]near Algeria's border with Libya, resulting in the death of 40 workers. In Amenas is also operated by Statoil, BP and Sonatrach. AQIM also appears to be resurgent across Africa. It said its fighters carried out Sunday's assault on a hotel in Ivory Coast[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/gunmen-carry-out-deadly-attack-on-ivory-coast-beach-resort-1457883860] that left at least 16 people dead. Its rival for jihadist hearts and minds, Islamic State, is a looming threat, too. From its strongholds in Libya, it has established a foothold in Algeria's mountainous northeast, where it killed a French tourist last year, according to Western officials.

Can developing petrostates learn to live without oil?,Norway,"As oil prices have nosedived over the past 14 months, it hasn’t been only petrostates like Saudi Arabia and Russia feeling the crunch. Developing nations like Angola, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Nigeria are also struggling to balance their budgets as deficits grow and government incomes shrink. In a bid to survive the slump, governments are experimenting with both austerity measures and fiscal stimulus. But policy maneuvers have their limits. After oil prices fell to $30 per barrel and below, many countries turned to international institutions like the World Bank and African Development Bank in search of emergency loans. International loans can help close budget gaps temporarily, but relying on international aid and increasing government debt is hardly a sustainable economic solution. If oil prices remain low, countries that depend almost exclusively on oil exports to fund their budgets will be forced to find new ways to diversify their economies and increase revenue streams. What now looks like an economic catastrophe may ultimately prove to be an opportunity for governments to liberalize their economies, experts say. “Diversification is coming a little bit late, but everyone is talking about diversification now. It’s a political reality,” says Soren Kirk Jensen, associate fellow for the Africa program at Chatham House, an independent policy institute. Swelling with oil revenue over the years, government leaders had little incentive to focus on economic diversification.  The financial crisis of 2008 proved to be a bump in the road, and its effects were short lived for most oil exporters. In 2014, rising US production and slowing Chinese demand sent oil prices plummeting. Cheap petroleum is typically a boon for investment and trade, but this time global economic growth cooled as markets are adapting to a new era of cheap oil. This intensified the need for countries to turn to international lenders for assistance. Some have found more success than others. New sources of revenue for Nigeria Many countries are not asking the International Monetary Fund  for loans, despite the fact that the IMF is typically viewed as the lender-of-choice in crisis situations. Instead, they’re turning to the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and even the Chinese government for help. Most of this can be attributed to the IMF’s strict conditionality, such as requiring that borrowers devalue their currency, observers say. Nigeria, for example, used a variety of tactics over the last year to stave off the worst impacts of its shrinking budget. Flouting IMF recommendations, the Nigerian government imposed capital controls and used its reserves to shore up its currency, the naira. The government of President Muhammadu Buhari, which has been in office a little under a year, avoided currency devaluation so that imports wouldn’t become too expensive. As a result, foreign exchange reserves are dwindling rapidly, and the country’s rainy day fund is almost entirely depleted. Instead, Nigeria has turned to the World Bank and African Development Bank, asking the lending institutions for $3.5 billion in loans. The amount will hardly make a dent in the $15 billion deficit the government is expected to have racked up this year. In the meantime, capital controls continue to stunt Nigeria’s economic growth, the IMF says. If the World Bank approves the $2.5 billion loan Nigeria requested, it’s likely the country will be obligated to devalue its currency anyway, in addition to other structural reforms. Aside from these short-term reforms, experts say Nigeria has a variety of options it could pursue to make its economy more sustainable and government revenue streams more diverse. Today, the government depends almost entirely on oil exports for its tax revenue and foreign exchange. Before Nigeria’s government began relying on oil the country was considered the breadbasket of West Africa, says John Campbell, senior fellow for Africa policy at the Council for Foreign Relations and US ambassador to Nigeria from 2004 to 2007. “Norway or the UK, for example, they took the bonanza of oil revenue and used it to restructure their economies,” Ambassador Campbell points out. “There has been none of that in Nigeria, it’s been a petroleum state since oil became the economic centerpiece back in the 1970s.” Campbell says Nigeria today is in many ways less developed than it was in the 1960s. The manufacturing sector is smaller, the railway network largely is atrophied, and the agricultural sector has dwindled, he says. Still, in every crisis there is opportunity. If Nigeria’s government were to begin taxing some of the country’s other industries, it could help balance the budget, experts say. Nollywood, Nigeria’s booming film industry, produces more movies than any other industry aside from India’s  Bollywood. The country’s telecommunications industry, while currently underdeveloped, also shows promise. “Over time I think there could be a shift in the economy, and there are Nigerian commentators who say the low oil prices are no bad thing, because it will encourage investment – particularly in agriculture or low-skilled manufacturing,” says Campbell. What’s more, some analysts argue this could be the perfect moment for the government to radically alter its fiscal policy. #mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; } /* Add your own MailChimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.

Peter Pham, Director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center. It wouldn’t be the first time Nigeria tried such a reform. When the former government of Goodluck Jonathan attempted to abolish the fuel subsidy in 2012, a nationwide strike brought the country to a standstill. Eventually the government acquiesced and began subsidizing fuel prices once more. Now, however, fuel prices are already below where the subsidy kicks in, rendering fuel subsidies ineffectual. Abolishing the subsidy could help the government save money over the long run and curb corruption, experts say. “The subsidy consumes a large amount of the federal discretionary budget, and getting rid of it would save them a lot of money in the future, which would help with diversifying,” says Dr. Pham. “Right now fuel is so well below market prices that it encourages all sorts of corruption where fuel is diverted and sold elsewhere,” Pham adds. “There are even shortages because people are re-exporting the subsidized fuel to make money.” Dubai on the Caspian begins to bend Unlike Nigeria, Azerbaijan is one of the few countries that turned to the IMF for assistance. In December 2015, Baku, which relies on oil exports for around 75 percent of its government revenue, also imposed capital controls in a bid to support its sliding currency, which had devalued by around a third. By late January, however, the government decided it was time to look for external support. A request for $4 billion in emergency loans was logged with the IMF and World Bank. Still, deals with the public lending heavyweights mean the country will have to liberalize its economy substantially. Surprisingly, President Ilham Aliyev, known for exerting influence over almost everything within Azerbaijan’s borders – economic or otherwise – has signaled his willingness to follow instructions. How much he is willing to loosen the reins, however, remains to be seen. “Azerbaijan is a country that politically has been moving in the wrong direction, and I think the question that the World Bank and IMF are going to be grappling with is both economic conditionality and political conditionality,” says Jeffrey Mankoff, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “That raises again the question of how far the government is willing to go when it comes to giving up control,” he says. Observers also question how much the government can push the country’s network of oligarchs to liberalize their holdings and increase transparency before it jeopardizes its base of support. Anti-corruption efforts are bound to be included on the to-do list the IMF and World Bank will place at Azerbaijan’s door in exchange for support, but they will be politically unpopular. So far, it appears that progress is being made to privatize some of Azerbaijan’s state-owned assets. Switzerland, one of the largest foreign investors in sectors of the economy unrelated to petrol, has been invited in to assist in the privatization process. What’s more, Azerbaijan, whose human rights record is vehemently criticized, took the world by surprise on March 17 when it pardoned 148 prisoners, including 14 activists considered by the international community to be political prisoners. The pardons are not directly linked to the country’s bid for international loans, but many speculate that the move is connected to the President’s upcoming visit to the United States and his desire to appease the international community during times of economic strife. Oil giants running out of options Angola, which relies on oil exports for between 70 to 80 percent of its government revenue and around 95 percent of its foreign exchange, has found itself in an especially tight spot. The country, which exports crude, is sending most of its supplies to China to pay off the estimated $25 billion in debt it’s accumulated. For Angola’s president of 36 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, China was an attractive partner because its loans and investments came without requests to curb corruption or liberalize the economy. Still, the country had to use oil as collateral for Chinese loans, meaning that more and more outputs are flowing to pay back pre-financed deals. Now, the country may be running out of crude to sell. After its almost three-decades-long civil war came to an end in 2002, Africa’s now third-largest economy changed its fortune by using oil reserves to become one of the world’s fastest growing economies. But many observers criticized the dos Santos regime for monopolizing the country’s oil wealth and sharing it only amongst its cronies. Most of Angola’s citizens live on less than $2 a day, and the country has one of the world’s lowest Gini coefficients – the World Bank’s measurement for inequality. Critics say dos Santos didn’t diversify the economy because he and his inner circle benefited too much from the status quo. As a result, data from the United Nations reveal that Angola has the second most concentrated export economy in the world, second only to Iraq. Now the effects of that are being felt. Last year the government dramatically reduced its budget as inflation continued to climb and the country’s currency fell to an all-time low. This placed a heavy toll on consumers in a country where around 80 percent of goods are imported. Government-imposed austerity measures contributed to a drop in living standards.   But analysts say the crisis could force the government to liberalize the economy, and could potentially lead to a political transformation. “In Angola, the leadership is very concerned with maintaining political control,” says Pham. “I’m not advocating authoritarianism, but you can liberalize the economy without liberalizing the politics.” Notwithstanding the current economic crunch, Angola still has the potential to develop other parts of its economy such as the service industry or the tourism and mining sectors, Pham asserts. “When oil was there and providing nice flows, the government kept a pretty strong lock on the economic sector. This is the opportunity to open up.” And some baby steps are being made in that direction, experts say. The Central Bank is looking create a workable stock exchange, and Angola successfully entered the bond market late last year. Meanwhile, the country’s first mass-producing steel mill was launched in December, an investment that aims to make economic diversification a reality. “The financial markets still have quite a bit of confidence in Angola. They are not planning to do another Eurobond in 2016, but probably next year,” says Mr. Kirk Jensen. “Hopefully for Angola, low oil prices will last long enough that [Angola] will start running a more realistic economic policy.” The country’s relatively young and progressive finance minister could provide a push in the right direction, experts say. What’s more, on March 11 President dos Santos announced that he plans to retire in 2018. No reason was given for his decision, and many express doubts over the veracity of his claim. The president made a similar announcement in 2001 and remains in power 15 years later. Still, if the 73-year-old leader does step down, it could open a pathway for increased transparency, economic liberalization, and anti-corruption efforts, experts say. “I think Angola will get out of this,” says Kirk Jensen. “I think they will learn from this very, very deep crisis, but I think they still have to invest a lot in getting the right institutions in place.” The country may soon enter discussions with the World Bank about a potential loan. Lessons left to learn Despite the optimistic tone adopted by many observers, not every country is learning from the oil price crash. Kazakhstan, for example, is receiving $1 billion each from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to deal with its estimated budget deficit of $2.2 billion, Kazakh officials said. Unlike other countries, Astana has made no visible preparations to diversify its economy. “The long-term plan should be diversification, but I haven’t seen Kazakhstan’s government making the same statements like in Azerbaijan, where they look like they are finally opening their eyes, at least on paper,” says Luca Anceschi, lecturer in Central Asian studies at the University of Glasgow. “Kazakhstan’s answer to the crisis has been oscillating between austerity and big spending,” Dr. Anceschi continues. “Right now it seems they are going the austerity way, but it also depends on what the loans will do.” The World Bank did not respond in time for publication to requests for comment.  Similarly, Venezuela’s government is 95 percent dependent on revenues from oil exports. Avoiding conditionality, Caracas has refused to reach out to the World Bank and IMF for support. Like Angola, it received billions in loans from China, but those loans don’t require that Caracas change the course of its economic policy. Inflation, meanwhile, is predicted to reach 720 percent this year, and political crisis is imminent. Other flailing states like Libya and Iraq have also been hit hard by the oil price downturn. Although oil prices aren’t expected to remain catastrophically low forever, it’s unlikely they will shoot back up to $100 a barrel anytime soon. What’s more, if world leaders are to succeed in keeping global warming under 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, fossil fuel demand should peak by 2020, according to the International Energy Agency. Developing other sources of income may be a good insurance policy if countries are eventually forced to keep their resources in the ground. Among international observers, consensus is building around the idea that it’s time for oil exporting countries to make bold reforms. “Now they are dipping their toe in the water,” says Pham. “But they need to jump in.”"
Norway in the offseason: Overcast and underappreciated,Norway,"Norway in March — with its gray skies, snow-covered countryside, icy streets and misty rains — is perhaps not everyone's idea of paradise, but it has its upside. In a word, you have the place more or less to yourself, or at least you don't have to share it with the raging hordes of selfie-snapping backpackers who descend on Scandinavia in the summer. As for my husband and myself, we started in Oslo, the laid-back, friendly capital nestled among hills at the end of the Oslofjord on the country's rugged southeast coast. From there, we took the train west to Bergen, itself built around a harbor on the semicircular sliver of land inside a bowl of mountains. Our itinerary was defined by the two talks that my husband, a university professor, was giving in each city. But the time surrounding the talks was ours to use as we wished. Oslo is marvelously pretty, with a capacious, lively waterfront, a necklace of surrounding, heavily wooded hills (some of them skiable), and blocks and blocks of neoclassical buildings painted in soft pastels —an astonishingly lovely palette that probably owed something to the gloomy, glowing early-spring sunlight. So it comes as a bit of a surprise to learn that for most of its long history (Oslo was founded in the 11th century), the place was a backwater, a poor relation to Stockholm and Copenhagen. It was not until the 1950s, a mere eye blink after its occupation by Nazi Germany, that the city remade itself as an expansive, cosmopolitan, world-class capital. But what struck me first was not the city's beauty or even its distinctly Scandinavian charm, but how quiet the place is. Horns do not blare, radios do not scream, and pedestrians, when they talk, keep their voices at conversational level. There are no blinking billboards or road-rage face-offs (at least none that I saw). Rather, civility reigns, so much so that I kept thinking I'd been swept back in time to a decade or so before my own ­mid-century birth. My husband being occupied, I started by wandering around on my own, street map in hand, beginning with the neighborhood surrounding our excellent, reasonably priced hotel, the Savoy. As it is only two blocks from Oslo's main drag, Karl Johans Gate, which stretches from Oslo's main train station on its eastern end to the impressively low-key royal palace in its public parkland on its western end, I was both in no danger of getting lost and in high danger of an attack of real estate envy. I turned right into the royal parkland, crossed it under milky-gray skies and kept going, taking in the quiet, tree-lined streets of elegant 19th-century apartment houses, breathing in the aromas coming from Oslo's omnipresent coffee-pastry shops and finally stumbling into Embla Keramikk, a ceramic studio where I debated with myself for a good half-hour before deciding that it would not be wise to schlep ceramics from Oslo to Bergen to London and finally home to New Jersey. Not that I didn't want to buy, at the very least, a fanciful dog figure or, even better, a bowl with a zebra's head peeking out of it. From there I skirted the National Theater, with its twin statues of Henrik Ibsen and the lesser-known Bjornstjerne Bjornson (winner of the Nobel Prize in literature in 1903). I continued past the vaguely Soviet-looking, brown-brick Radhus (city hall), with its two imposing square towers, to the Akershus Fortress, dating to the Middle Ages, with its battlements, towers, ramparts, marching grounds, stables, prison grounds and cannon, and towers — plus Norway's Resistance Museum, commemorating the country's World War II history. Although it was late afternoon and many buildings were about to close, I was able to walk the entire circular Fortress Trail, taking in the general sweep of the place and admiring the harbor. On the opposite side, I could see the sleek, chic shopping district of Aker Brygge, with the stunning Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, its roofs looking like two sails fully unfurled. As our time was short and the ferries weren't running, my husband and I had to forgo a visit to Oslo's Viking Ship Museum on the Bygdoy peninsula. We chose instead to walk through neighborhoods of big old solid houses to Oslo's famous Frogner Park, home of the outdoor sculpture wonderland created by Gustav Vigeland. All I can say is that you have to see it to believe it: more than 200 massive, playful, nude and very real (if not realistic) sculptures portraying human life in all its variety, cast in bronze, granite and iron. You stand there staring, jaw dropped, tears flowing. The astonishing vision, which more often than not is crawling with schoolchildren, is topped by a 20-meter-high obelisk of yearning, intertwined figures. After Vigeland, the atmosphere, and art, of the National Gallery, a huge, 19th-century monolith of a building, seemed somewhat tame, despite the many masterpieces hanging on the walls, including some by Norway's most famous artist, Edvard Munch. More on Munch later. But note that if you can't make it to either Oslo's Munch Museum or Bergen's KODE collection, then you kind of have to see the Munch offerings here, which dazzle. One of the artist's four ""Screams"" is on display. Next stop: Bergen, which we got to on the Bergen Railway — which, throughout seven hours, took us west over one of Europe's highest mountain plateaus, where it climbed through thick forests of fir trees, small villages and finally, above the tree line, glaciers and rivers of ice, before descending again to what must be one of the world's most charming urban idylls. Like Oslo, Bergen — which, by the way, is one of Europe's wettest cities — was dry and almost entirely tourist-free. So on my first morning there, I had the old wharf, a former center of the league of Hanseatic merchants — a German trading company that operated in northern climes from about 1360 to 1760 — almost entirely to myself. Now a reconstructed World Heritage Site, Bryggen, as the area is called, is the city's oldest bit, a string of pumpkin-and-tomato-painted wooden, gabled warehouses, occupied almost entirely by knickknack shops. I visited the Bryggens Museum, which was built over the remains of the city's earliest medieval settlement and portrays the story of the city's many fires and rebirths. Here, too, I visited the Hanseatic Museum, housed in two 18th-century wooden (and unheated) buildings where fish and cod-liver oil were once stored and pressed. Workers and apprentices lived there, too, running the Norwegian branch of the Hanseatic League. Speaking of fish, I loved the Bergen Aquarium, at the end of the Nordnes peninsula, with its playful sea lions, shark tunnel, sparkling Norwegian piranhas, salmon and cod, and small, jewel-like tropical beauties. If fish don't get you going, it's well worth your time to meander through the aquarium's nearby neighborhoods. Seemingly storybook small wooden houses line cobblestone alleys, painted in an array of pretty pale colors and so peaceful (at least in March) that it's hard to imagine that ordinary human beings eat, sleep, argue, raise children and watch TV here. It was hard to decide on one last cultural excursion, but we finally decided on KODE, four museum buildings in the heart of the city (as well as the homes of Edvard Grieg and two other composers). Unlike many of Bergen's smaller tourist sites, the main KODE museums remain open all year, so we were able to take in one of the world's largest and most important Munch collections , housed in KODE 3. Munch's works, unlike those of other world-class artists, remain almost entirely in Norway and hence are not often seen in person, in all their vibrant, richly colored and often muscularly optimistic power. ""The Scream""? Munch's oeuvre is so much bigger and more interesting than that one iconic image, beloved by undergraduates, that I wanted to scream myself. But I controlled myself and continued on to admire the other pieces in KODE 3's collection of art from Norway's late-19th-century ""golden age,"" as well as period furnishings and decorative objects. Our final foray in Bergen had us ascending the Floyen, one of the mountains that surround the city, overlooking the city center and harbor with its bright red and yellow ships. It's usually accessible by funicular, but at the moment the railway was closed for maintenance. No matter. The steep hike, up flights of steps built into the hill and then onto public pathways, rewarded us with ""wow""-inducing views, not to mention hearty appetites. Next stop: dinner at the Bare restaurant, located in the Radisson Blu Hotel Norge. All I will say is that, concluding a visit to a place of such astonishing natural beauty, comprising both forested mountains and endlessly sparkling fjords and sea, we had one of the best meals of our lives. travel@washpost.com Moses is an author and painter.

Low-cost airline boss Bjorn Kjos will fly you to New York for £149 (and says we MUST build a new runway in Britain),Norway,"Walking through Gatwick with Bjorn Kjos is rather like accompanying a celebrity or a member of the Royal Family. Everyone, but everyone, seems to know the chief executive of low-cost airline Norwegian, and they all want a chat with him. It’s possible Kjos, 69, does not normally travel in economy class, where I am wedged between him and his PR aide on the flight from London to Oslo. If so, the multimillionaire puts up a good show: he doesn’t flinch at taking the Gatwick Express instead of a limo. The 69-year old speeds through the airport, leaving me breathless (and I run marathons). Kjos has an air of boyish surprise at finding himself running Norwegian. Perhaps this is because he is an accidental tycoon, who after earlier careers as a fighter pilot and lawyer, bought a bankrupt company and turned it into an unexpected international success. Just in case his CV is not improbable enough, he has also written a Cold War thriller, Murmanskaffæren, or the Murmansk Affair, published in 2006, though he says he has no plans to pen a Scandi Noir TV script for BBC4. He has also spent five years working on a book about the airline and himself –Hoyt og Lavt or ‘High and Low’. By his account, he stumbled into his current incarnation as an airline magnate. In 1993, he was approached to draw up an investment plan to rescue a small domestic operator. Finding new backers proved difficult, so he and his brother took a stake. ‘I put in about £200,000, which was more than I had at the time, so my wife didn’t like it at all.’ The gamble paid off: having started with a tiny fleet of Fokker 50s flying round the west coast of Norway, the company is now the third-largest low-cost airline in Europe, carrying 26m passengers a year to 130 destinations. In the UK, Norwegian flies out of Gatwick, Manchester, Edinburgh and Birmingham and carries 4m British passengers. Kjos says he will look at listing the shares, which are quoted on the Oslo stock exchange, on the London market. ‘If our hub is London in future we should have a listing here. UK listing would help us diversify our investors,’ he says. Who are the biggest shareholders? ‘Me!’ he says, laughing. ‘I have 25 per cent.’ That means his stake is worth more than £230m, though his annual pay is modest by the standards of UK chief executives at around £132,000. He says he pays a huge rate of tax on his wealth, but that he does not want to leave Norway because his wife, Gerd Helene, a former air stewardess, wouldn’t like it. Flying runs in the family: one of his two daughters, Anna, is a pilot for Norwegian and his father, Ola, started a small airline Norsk Skogbruskfly in 1953. The young Bjorn, who was hooked from childhood, trained for two years as a pilot in Mississippi and Arizona then became a fighter pilot in 334 Squadron of the Norwegian Royal Air Force at the height of the Cold War, fending off Soviet intruders between 1969 and 1975. He considered becoming a commercial pilot after leaving the service but found the planes a bit of a comedown. ‘It was as if you are used to driving a Formula One car, then suddenly you are in a road car,’ he says. Instead, he went into law. ‘I was working in a very small town as a judge so I knew all the criminals and some of them were very nice people, so I didn’t like sending them to prison,’ he says. Kjos is incredibly charming, but not everyone has been won over. He has clashed with unions, and has fallen foul of the Scandinavian idea of ‘Janteloven’, where equality is valued above individual success. He is now betting heavily on cheap long-haul flights, a nut no-one in the business has truly cracked. He is the first to make a concerted attempt on the transatlantic routes since Freddie Laker tried and failed in the Seventies, not that this seems to deter him. ‘Laker had to rely on the travel agencies and they were in the pockets of the airlines. It is very different now that we have the internet.’ THE MAN BJORN TO BE KING Family: Married to Gerd Helene with three children – Lars Ola, 38, Guri Helene, 36 and Anna Helene, 33. Favourite film: Avatar. Favourite gadget: iPhone. Best advice received: ‘Only have people on your team who are better than you.’ Mentor: ‘My wife,’ he says. Career: Having served as fighter pilot during the Cold War, he took over bankrupt airline Busy Bee in 1993, turning it into Norwegian, where he has been chief executive since 2002. It launched in the UK a year later and is now the third-biggest, low-cost airline in Europe. The airline carries 4m British passengers a year from Gatwick, Manchester, Edinburgh and Birmingham. Working day: Most days he rises at 7am, though he may be up at 5am if he is travelling, which he often is two or three times a week. He has a light breakfast of cereal then arrives at the office in Oslo around 8am and works until 5pm or 6pm. After work, he goes cross-country skiing for an hour. ‘When I ski, I think, think, think,’ he says. ‘For me it is therapy.’ Spare time: He loves golf and hunting in Scotland as well as sailing and skiing. An opera buff, he enjoys visits to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden followed by a meal at his favourite London restaurant Balthazar. He also points to the new jet engines, which have greater capacity and are much more fuel efficient, bringing down the costs. ‘The lower oil price is another bonus.’ Are his prices really that cheap? Yes, though you would have to book well ahead to get the best deals. Norwegian’s lowest London to New York flight is £149, including tax, and a bit less on the way back, so passengers could get a return for less than £300 but the best-priced tickets are snapped up quickly. Alternatively, they can pay £50 extra each way for a checked bag, seat reservation and on-board meals. Just as Freddie Laker did in his day, Kjos is facing opposition from the old guard. He is locked in battle with the US Department of Transportation over two applications for permits, one from the UK and one from Ireland which have been stuck in the system for a two-and-a-half years. The average wait to approve an application is 53 days. Kjos says: ‘They are being protectionist, obviously, it is the only way to put it.’ On the subject of Europe, Kjos says: ‘I don’t know where Brexit is, but I will fly there, ha, ha, ha.’ Seriously though, the Brexit camp here puts forward Norway as an example of a country that does perfectly well without being in the European Union. Why can’t we be like Norway? ‘It is an issue for the British public to decide. Norway was able to stay outside of the EU because of our oil wealth. But we have to adopt every law and regulation they make in the EU, without having any say.’ Kjos also has controversial views on female board members: he thinks Britain should copy Norway, where firms must hit a quota of 40 per cent women directors. ‘Should the UK adopt a quota system? Yes, or you will have too much old man’s thinking,’ he says. ‘There is too much of an old boys’ club. They think they are the best in the world and they are definitely not. I have no doubts about quotas because I have two daughters.’ In the Gatwick versus Heathrow battle for a new runway, unsurprisingly he favours the former. But will either ever happen, given we have been talking about it for 40 years? ‘Very good point,’ he says. ‘You need to do it to create jobs and get the tourists into London. Every new Dreamliner, it has a Rolls-Royce engine. We have recently done a $2.7bn deal with Rolls-Royce. ‘It is very sad that you are not doing it, because it is costing millions of jobs.’ He must think us terribly inefficient and short-termist, I venture. He just smiles. ‘We will carry on doing what we do, providing low- cost fares so people can travel.’ And with that, he strides swiftly off into the Oslo night."
Let’s not turn the Arctic into an adventure playground,Norway,"As polar ice retreats, tourists are rushing in, many claiming to bear witness to climate change. But their expeditions are only speeding the region’s destruction Every year at about this time, a Russian cargo plane deposits many tonnes of equipment on an ice floe one degree off the north pole. There, at the 89th parallel, engineers begin construction of a private ice air strip and base camp for scientists, adventurers and, more than ever, wealthy tourists. Related: Northwest Passage, Canada: going with the floe[http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/29/northwest-passage-canada-arctic-going-with-the-floe] From the camp, it’s a seven- to 10-day trudge by dog sled or ski – or, for those less fit or in a hurry, a 40-minute helicopter ride – to get to a location where they can legitimately power up the satellite phone and call someone to say: “Hello! Can you hear me? I’m at the north pole.” The price of placing that call starts at £13,500 (flights not included). The extreme cold, lack of facilities and unpredictable Arctic weather allow for no lingering or reflection, and there are only about four weeks when the sea ice is solid enough to attempt the journey. Only this year, the ice air strip developed a huge crack, stranding the 2016 class of Arctic adventurers in Norway while engineers try injecting water into the gap in the hopes of freezing it over, or begin looking for another ice floe. The polar regions have been warming twice as fast as anywhere else due to climate change But we are running out of ice floes. And we are running out of time to put systems in place to deal effectively with the enormous changes remaking the Arctic – before there is a human and environmental catastrophe. As rapidly as the tour groups, research cruises and explorers claiming to bear witness to climate change are rushing into the Arctic in search of adventure, the Arctic, or at least that part of it that has existed as ice for thousands of years, is retreating. The ice cover over the Arctic ocean is disappearing at a far faster clip than scientists had anticipated even a decade ago, bringing a rush of visitors and a scramble for one of the last great untapped repositories of oil and gas, faster shipping routes, and mining, fishing, and tourism opportunities that will overwhelm local communities and infrastructure. This winter has been freakishly warm, even for the Arctic. The polar regions have been warming twice as fast as anywhere else due to climate change. Those changes have consequences well beyond the Arctic, altering ocean currents and jumbling weather patterns. But nowhere are the real-time effects of climate change as visible as in the Arctic. It was 21.7C (71F) at the Klawock weather station in south-eastern Alaska last month[https://scienceforthefuture.wordpress.com/2016/03/31/alaska-hits-70-degrees-in-march-for-first-time-ever/], a record. The Arctic sea ice cover, at its winter peak, was the lowest in the satellite image history, which will likely set up even more melting this summer, according to scientists. Alaska has already had its first wildfire of the year, in what should usually be the snow-bound month of February. Last December brought temperatures around 30C above normal at the north pole[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/12075282/North-Pole-temperatures-spike-above-freezing-as-Storm-Frank-sends-warm-air-north.html]. It’s these staggering changes that have opened up the Arctic to commercial possibilities and to tourism. The private camp on the ice floes did not exist in 2000. Until 2007 the Northwest Passage[http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/20/chilling-history-exhibition-northwest-passage] – another fabled destination – was thought to be too clogged with ice even in the summer months for transit without an icebreaker. This summer the Northwest Passage will become a mass tourism destination, with a  scheduled sailing in August of the Crystal Serenity[http://www.crystalcruises.co.uk/northwest-passage-cruise/anchorage-to-new-york-city--7320], a luxury cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew. The 32-day cruise from Anchorage to New York is sold out, with prices from $22,000 up to $120,000 for a deluxe state room. But where outsiders seek profit and adventure, local people see risk and the destruction of their culture and way of life. Well before the chasm opened up in the north pole base camp, indigenous people were familiar with the treacherous ice conditions across the Arctic. Native communities on the Bering coast rely on a frozen platform of 1 metre or more to hunt and fish and travel in a region where there are almost no roads. But in recent years snowmobiles have been breaking through thinning ice. This winter Bering Sea hunters complained they were running out of room to set pots for crab fishing, or trap seal and other animals. Those risks do not deter adventure seekers. On the contrary, the US and Canadian coastguards report they are called out increasingly to rescue tourists kayaking or skiing across remote and unfamiliar terrain. Such operations are immensely costly, given the distances and extreme conditions. On 4 March, it took two coastguard helicopters, a C-130 military transport plane and 24 highly trained rescue personnel to recover two British tourists from a ski trip gone wrong in the Bering Strait, according to the coastguards. And in several of the past few years there have been more adventure cruises than government ships transiting the strait. Shipping traffic overall through the Arctic has doubled since 2008, with some estimates of a 30-fold increase in shipping by 2020. The prospect of rescuing some 1,000 people, many of them elderly, from the freezing waters of the Northwest Passage is terrifying for local people[http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/28/us-canada-arctic-cruise-ship-titanic-emergency-training-coast-guard] (even if the Crystal has given assurances it will sail with an icebreaking escort vessel carrying two helicopters) and for the US and Canadian emergency response agencies whose nearest bases are hundreds of miles away. Once the liner enters the Canadian Arctic it will dock at ports of call with populations half as numerous as the paying customers aboard. The US and Canadian coastguard will carry out drills for a mass rescue from the Crystal in Anchorage next week. But some local communities, such as the town of Nome are scheduled to receive disaster training only after the Crystal sails by.Just as terrifying for people who live off the land is the idea of an oil spill fouling remote Arctic waters and the seals, walruses and bird life they depend on for food. US government marine biologists have already been tracking oiled wildlife off the Bering Strait, as well as a mysterious illness among seals. Ships venturing into the newly open waters of the Arctic are still allowed to use heavy fuel oil, which is a major source of black carbon. The powerful climate pollutant darkens ice and snow, speeding its warming. Arctic governments have singled out the risk of a heavy fuel oil spill as the single biggest threat to marine wildlife and the local economy. Heavy fuel oil is banned in Antarctic waters. Cruise lines, which use the same ships to operate at both poles, have committed to using less polluting fuels. But heavy fuel oil is still lawful for the Arctic, and the default choice for many cargo ships. It is too late to stop climate change entirely. Many of the changes under way in the Arctic are now inevitable, even with all the good intentions encapsulated in last December’s Paris climate change[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris] agreement. But it is not too late to stop treating the Arctic as a great adventure playground for the rich and the restless – and protect the polar region for the people who live there. It is still possible to limit the scope of future climate effects, with deeper cuts on greenhouse gas emissions, especially within the next few years. The first port of call should be a ban on drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic. And there is still time to prevent an even dirtier version of an Exxon Valdez or BP oil spill in pristine Arctic waters. On 18 April, the environmental council of the International Maritime Organisation will meet in London, and campaign groups are pressing for a ban on heavy fuel oil in the Arctic. A number of the adventurers holed up in Norway waiting for the repairs to the ice runway claim to be making their epic journeys in the name of conservation – saying they need to go now, before the Arctic is ice-free. “These rapid environmental changes will likely consign epic, long range, polar ice expeditions to the pages of history,” one expedition lamented. Giving up on the chance to make that call from the other side would no doubt be a personal tragedy for explorers or well-heeled adventure tourists. But if they really cared about the Arctic, it would make more sense to stay home andtake up an equally challenging mission: pressing political and business leaders for a ban on oil and gas drilling and the use of heavy fuel oil. It might not rival the bragging rights of a polar phone call, but it could help preserve that last great open space for the people who live there and future generations."
Loch Ness monster find turns out to be film prop,Norway,"A marine robot deployed in the waters of Scotland's Loch Ness has found the remains of a monster but it turned out to be a prop from a movie shot in 1970. The robot, belonging to Norwegian offshore oil company Kongsberg Maritime, is drawing up the first high-resolution map of the 230-metre (755-feet) deep lake in a project named ""Operation Groundtruth"". ""Although it is the shape of Nessie, it is not the remains of the monster that has mystified the world for 80 years,"" Scottish tourism agency VisitScotland, which is backing the project, said on Wednesday. The agency's statement said ""Nessie found"" with an asterisk at the bottom reading ""replica model"". The blurry object with a long neck was a 30-foot (9.15-metre) long model of the monster made for the film ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"", directed by Billy Wilder. ""It is thought the model sank after its humps were removed (the buoyancy was in the humps) never to be seen again,"" VisitScotland said in a statement. The monster was actually a submarine in the film. The mapping is being carried out by a robot called ""Munin"", which resembles a missile-shaped drone. It also found a 27-foot long shipwreck, which is still being investigated, and worked out that there is no ""Nessie trench"" in the loch bed in which a creature could be hiding, as previously believed. ""The vehicle is providing insight to the loch's depths as never before imagined. Finding Nessie was, of course, an unexpected bonus,"" Craig Wallace, a Kongsberg Maritime engineer, said in a statement. Previous discoveries made in Loch Ness include a crashed World War II bomber plane, a 100-year-old fishing boat and the remains of a speedboat used in a 1952 speed record attempt which killed its pilot. The lake has been notoriously difficult to survey due to its depth and steeply sloping side walls. VisitScotland estimates the revenue generated by tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of ""Nessie"" at £60 million (76 million euros, $85 million) a year. dt/rjm/pvh"
These two changes in the ocean are downright scary; Oceans are warmer and more acidic than ever before in recorded history,Norway,"Oceans are warmer and more acidic than ever before in recorded history The oceans are warmer and more acidic than ever before in recorded history, and likely ever since modern humans evolved. That should worry everyone alive today. Why? As go the oceans, so goes the health of the globe. Oceans produce more than half the oxygen we breathe, and are critical to regulating the climate. They have absorbed at least 90% of the heat from global warming since 1970, and continue to absorb 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, equal to the weight of all the oil carried by supertankers annually. This carbon dioxide makes seawater more acidic and kills off many animals that have shells, including many of the smallest animals that feed life in the ocean. It’s clear that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of these changes. If we continue on our current path of carbon emissions, we can expect ocean warming to accelerate, with temperatures rising twice as much in the next 40 years as they did in the past 140, further disrupting ocean life and the people who rely on it. Sea levels could rise by up to 6 feet by the end of the century — which would flood parts of many East Coast cities, including New York City. We can already see that climate change is reshuffling ocean life like a deck of cards. For some, this is a winning hand. Fishermen have caught species they’ve never caught before, including blueline tilefish off New Jersey and Humboldt squid in Washington state. For many others in the $6 billion U.S. seafood and fishing industry, however, this rapid warming and acidification has brought uncertainty and instability. The $110 million West Coast shellfish industry nearly collapsed over the last decade as acidified ocean water effectively dissolved billions of young oysters before they could grow. On the East Coast, unusually warm water temperatures appear to have killed surf clams in large numbers off the shores of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. This is one of the largest fisheries in the region, and a major processing plant in Virginia has already closed, only to reopen in New England where the clams are still doing well. A similar story describes lobsters in Long Island Sound. The fishery crashed around 2000 after a string of extreme warm summers, and it hasn’t recovered. Cod, the superlative white fish on dinner plates around the world and the species that first attracted Europeans to North America, is expected to become scarce in U.S. waters as temperatures continue warming. Away from the U.S., a rapid increase in deadly marine algae off the coast of Chile, driven by warmer oceans, killed up to 20% of the country’s farmed salmon, including millions at four fish farms owned by New York-listed salmon farmer Marine Harvest ASA.(MHG, US) (MHG, NO)  Chile is the world’s second-largest producer of salmon, and the algal bloom has driven up prices for consumers. Read: How toxic algae are threatening humans and wildlife across the world Ocean warming has also destabilized international politics. While no shots were fired, the Mackerel Wars from 2010 resulted from a sharp disagreement between Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, Norway, and the European Union when schools of the valuable fish moved much further north than usual. With everyone catching the fish–and refusing to cooperate and set sustainable catch levels–the stock faced a double (or rather quadruple) jeopardy and was threatened with a collapse. The issue was only resolved in 2014 after trade sanctions and threats eventually led to an agreement to divide the catch equitably. Even tourism could be affected. An underwater heat wave is devastating huge swaths of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, a Unesco world-heritage site. The warm temperatures stress the corals, which bleach, revealing the white skeleton underneath. If the heat stress is sustained, the coral begins to starve and will eventually die. The key point is that these changes are happening now, not in some distant future, and they affect our economy and our dinner plates, as well as our planet. Avoiding further damage to marine life and further economic impacts will take a two-pronged approach: rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid further global warming, and a new approach to ocean management that can adapt to the unavoidable changes without opening the doors to overfishing. Achieving this will require new science to more effectively set sustainable fishing levels for a warmer, more acidic ocean, as well as greater incentives to use the science we already have. We can still recover from many of the changes to the ocean so far, but the window for doing so is closing fast.

Svalbard: tourism’s final frontier,Norway,"“Watch out for polar bears!” friends said when they heard I was going to Svalbard. And there I was, less than five minutes after landing at Longyearbyen airport, face to face with a huge male bear, frozen in a hunting pose, eyes fixed in a deathly stare. OK, it was standing in the middle of the luggage carousel and it hadn’t hunted anything in a long time, aside from suitcases, given that it was stuffed. But, still — it was like Jurassic Park International having a giant model of a T-Rex in arrivals. Many tourists travelling to this Norwegian archipelago, three hours’ flying time due north from Oslo and just 1,300km from the North Pole, come to see the islands’ 3,000 bears. Most are disappointed. The bears largely live on the pack ice, in areas fiercely protected by the Norwegian government, hundreds of kilometres north of the capital, Longyearbyen. Sightings do occur near to the city — there was the tragic case of the British schoolboy killed by a bear 40km from Longyearbyen in 2011 — but they are rare. For most visitors — 97 per cent, in fact — our friend at the airport is the closest they’ll come. Just as well, then, that a visit to Svalbard is about much more than bears. On the drive into Longyearbyen (five minutes, on a 5km stretch of the archipelago’s 46km of roads), the driver explained a little of Svalbard’s history. Dutchman Willem Barentsz had first sighted the islands in 1596 and christened them Spitsbergen (Dutch for “sharp-peaked mountains”). From the 17th to the early 19th centuries it had been a hunting free-for-all, as the British, Dutch and Danish slaughtered the whales for oil, the polar bears for their pelts and walruses for their ivory, almost to the point of extinction. In the early 20th century an American, John Munro Longyear, discovered coal. The second free-for-all followed as mines opened up along the fiords — there was no national claim to the islands until the Svalbard Treaty of 1920. It gave Norway sovereignty, but also allowed the 13 other original signatories (now grown to 42, including Afghanistan, North Korea and Russia) the rights for their citizens to reside in Svalbard and for their nations to engage in mining there. A global collapse in coal prices, from around $120 a tonne in 2011 to $45 a tonne today, and the costs of mining at this latitude, mean that today only three mines remain. Of those, the largest, at Sveagruva, 44km as the crow flies from the capital, is due to close later this year. So Svalbard needs a sustainable future. And it is hoped that my busload of visitors, along with the 135,000 other tourists who will journey here this year, are a large part of it. We arrived in Longyearbyen, population 2,100 (of the archipelago’s 2,500 total) and, at 78 degrees, the world’s northernmost town (only a couple of military and research bases are closer to the pole). We dropped our bags at the Radisson Blu Polar, the world’s northernmost serviced hotel, by now realising that the prefix “world’s northernmost” would feature a lot during our visit. (For reasons of space, it will henceforth be denoted with an asterisk.) We headed out on a walking tour, starting at the Svalbard Brewery*, down by the Adventfjord on which Longyearbyen sits. It is owned by Robert Johansen, 57, a former miner who fought for years to overturn a 1928 brewing ban on Svalbard (authorities thought that a combination of alcohol and miners stuck in a tiny settlement might not be such a great one). In 2014 he succeeded. Today, he produces 250,000 litres a year, made mostly with water from a nearby glacier. “I thought it would be nice to have something of our own here,” he told me. “Before, we only had coal.” We headed into town, no rough frontier place these days but full of bright buildings: schools*, restaurants*, even a Thai supermarket* (the Thai, numbering some 200, form the second-largest ethnic group on Svalbard; lovesick miners went to Thailand on holiday in the 1980s and brought back more than photographs). As we walked, our guide, Anika Paust, explained about the polar night — from roughly December 10 until mid-January Svalbard is in total darkness. From then on, each day brings 20 minutes more daylight until April 19, when the sun rises and doesn’t set again until August 23. In early March, when we were there, the sun rises high enough above the mountains to finally hit Longyearbyen. No surprise, then, that most people in the town had a look of startled wonder on their faces, as if they’d just had sacks removed from their heads. Above us on the bleak, snow-covered valley walls stood long-abandoned coal mines, everywhere the wooden pylons of the old cableways that once brought down the coal, silent now but once filling the valley 24 hours a day with fearsome clanking and squealing. We passed a lonely graveyard* marked with simple crosses. They stopped burials here in the 1950s, as bodies started popping up out of the permafrost in a thaw. These days you are not allowed to be born, grow old or die in Svalbard because, respectively, Norway doesn’t want to grant citizenship to any children of the 43 different nationalities who call Svalbard home, there are no elderly care facilities (when you are no longer economically productive, you must leave, a bit like Logan’s Run without the euthanasia), and there’s nowhere to bury people. We passed the university* and former miners’ barracks, now turned into student accommodation — Svalbard, Paust explained, is now one of the world’s leading centres for climate studies — and arrived at Huset, once the miners’ community hall, now a restaurant. We removed our shoes — strict protocol in Longyearbyen, a legacy of the mining days, when not only the entire landscape was coated in coal dust but carpets, too. There we ate a seven-course tasting menu including Arctic char, Svalbard reindeer sausages and king crab, each dish accompanied by different wines from Huset’s 20,000-strong cellar. It felt weird to be eating so fabulously in a place so far from the rest of the world; like finding a good gastropub on Mars. The next day, after a delay — one of our party was trapped in his hotel room for an hour after the shifting permafrost had jammed his door shut — we headed out on snowmobiles, destination Barentsburg, a Russian mining town some 70km away. The guides both carried rifles in case of bear encounters, a compulsory requirement for anybody leaving the city limits of Longyearbyen. We rode inland alongside a frozen river and then climbed, cutting between peaks on high passes, and then dipped down again, barrelling along deep, twisting troughs like a bobsleigh run, and then out on to a boundless plain, the sky and the land utterly indistinguishable, a bleached-out world of total whiteness. Flying across the ice, the only way you could tell you were moving was by looking at the speedometer. We stopped to photograph some Svalbard reindeer. Their ancestors are thought to have walked across from the mainland during the last ice age and are, along with the bears and Arctic fox, the only land mammals in Svalbard. With their stumpy legs and thick pelts, they’ve adapted superbly to conditions here, using their ice-pick-like hooves to cut through the permafrost to find the vegetation beneath. Without any natural predators (polar bears can’t chase them because they’d overheat), the reindeer are very tame. And, like the recovering numbers of whales and bears, since commercial bans on hunting them were imposed (there were thought to be fewer than 1,000 left in 1920), their numbers have recovered to around 12,000 today. Soon after, we passed a graveyard of rusting old Soviet-era trucks and machinery and then entered Barentsburg, all signs now in Cyrillic. Next to the coal-fired power station that keeps the settlement alive, we met our guide, Evgeniy Brylkinm, a twenty-something from the Urals who’d pitched up in Barentsburg a few months earlier in search of adventure and now looked as if he wished he hadn’t. Brylkinm took us on the tour, past the kindergarten, on its walls a giant mural featuring the Kremlin and St Basil’s Cathedral, a Russian consulate*, the world’s second-most northerly brewery, a brutalist monument to Soviet miners*, an Orthodox chapel* and a statue of Comrade Lenin. “Our hero,” said Brylkinm. (There is another Russian settlement further north, Pyramiden, abandoned in 1998, with a Lenin statue*.) Brylkinm told us that there are 350 miners in Barentsburg, down from 1,300 in the Soviet heyday, many of them Ukrainians. “On Soviet Army Day 10 years ago, there was big fight; knives, smashed faces,” Brylkinm said. After a lunch of borscht and pickles and solyanka (pork stew) in the Barentsburg Hotel, we visited the gift shop, where we perused the Lenin caps and packs of old roubles wrapped in cellophane. Even now, I can’t help thinking I might have imagined Barentsburg. The next afternoon, kitted out with snowshoes, we headed for the glacier behind Longyearbyen. At the city limits, Signe Dahlberg, 25, and Karl Schönning, 32, our guides, stopped to load their rifles (live rounds are not allowed in town), and then we were off, climbing steeply, the only sounds our snowshoes crunching into the soft snow and our heavy breathing. After three hours in the dark, we arrived at our accommodation: a snowcave, about six metres across. As Karl cooked up a lamb stew, Signe told us a little more about Svalbard (from the Norse “cold rim”), how of its 62,500 sq km land mass, 60 per cent is sheathed in glacial ice, 30 per cent is barren ground (scree, rock, moraines) and only 10 per cent is vegetated. Its seven national parks and 23 nature reserves now cover two-thirds of the islands. She told us how a 2015 ban on cruise ships using heavy marine oil — similar to the one enforced in Antarctica in 2011 — means that only small expedition ships can now access the remote parts (where the bears live). Svalbard, she said, is now one of the most well-protected ecosystems on earth. After dinner, we got into our down bags and, in the tight circular space, arranged ourselves like spokes on a wheel, plumes of frozen breath rising, nobody daring to go outside for fear of becoming the world’s northernmost toilet-related polar-bear incident. In the morning, we clambered down a ladder in a hole in the corner of the cave, and then walked along narrow, twisting corridors of 1,000-year-old ice, corkscrewing down inside the glacier. This was a meltwater channel through which, come the thaw, millions of gallons of water would rage. Above our heads, huge paving-slabs of rock dangled precariously from the ice. Signe showed us how the ice is layered, like the rings of a tree, so that you can tell its age. Tiny blobs of air bubbles trapped in the pellucid walls looked like strings of pearls. Down and down we walked, squeezing along the narrow tube, until we were deep inside the glacier. Signe asked us to turn off our headtorches. For a minute we stood in Stygian silence, utterly lost to the world. On my last day, I went to visit Mine No 3, a working mine until 1996, but now open to tourists. My guide, Kristen Jaeger Wexsahl, 25, showed me around the former pithead, where ID cards, overalls and newspapers from the day it closed lay around, as if the miners were just on a tea break. I asked her what it was like to live here, especially through the winters. “People really like the mørketid [dark time],” she said. “It is so dark and cold that nature forces you to stop. You effectively hibernate. No matter how much we try and impose ourselves on nature, our bodies are more or less Stone Age. Living in Svalbard puts you back in your rightful place in the animal kingdom.” Back outside, we looked out over Adventfjorden to Isfjorden beyond. “This is the first winter ever that there’s been no sea ice in the outer fiords,” Wexsahl said, referring to the year’s record high sea temperatures. As we drove back to town, we passed a giant concrete door in the side of the mountain. “What’s that?” I asked. “The Global Seed Vault[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7a98c268-e3f5-11dc-8799-0000779fd2ac.html],” Wexsahl replied. “Since 2008, scientists have been depositing seeds here from the world’s most important crops. If a disaster happens, it would be like a Noah’s Ark, a way to rebuild.” It seemed ironic that Svalbard, plundered for so long, struggling to survive against the climactic odds, could yet hold salvation for the rest of us. Cutting-edge architecture at Europe’s furthest fringe A remote fishing village in Norway’s Lofoten Islands is to be the unlikely site for a spectacular new luxury hotel. The Lofoten Opera hotel (pictured above, as an artist’s impression) has been designed by Snøhetta, an architectural practice known for the Alexandria Library in Egypt, the Norwegian National Opera house in Oslo and the entry pavilion at the 9/11 memorial in New York. Groundwork is nearing completion and the hotel is due to open within three years. It will sit on a rocky promontory just outside Sørvågen, a fishing community with fewer than 500 residents, close to where the road runs out at the far western end of the Lofoten chain. Despite its isolation, the property will have a spa, swimming pool and restaurant, with between 40 and 65 rooms. Dag Møller, the Oslo financier behind the project, says he was responding to a need for jobs in the area, and a lack of upmarket accommodation for visitors eager to see the Northern Lights, as well as to hike, ski, fish and kayak.

House prices on the sprint in host cities,Norway,"As Londoners get ready for race day, Fiona Brandhorst analyses the 26 marathon locations with the hottest property markets Every year, thousands of runners pound the pavements of the world's most recognisable cities, as they challenge themselves to complete a marathon. Often unwittingly, they race down some of the most prestigious streets and past the front gates of many desirable addresses. As runners prepare for tomorrow's London marathon, we analyse the 26 marathon cities that have seen the fastest growth in property prices over 2015. Shenzhen, China 1 This former fishing village and now China's ""Silicon Valley"" recorded the highest annual property price growth of any marathon city in the world. Property prices in Shenzhen rose by 50 per cent last year, driven up by a frenzy of borrowing as a burgeoning middle class of young workers - the population of 10 million has an average age of 30 - clambered to get on the property ladder. New-home prices have jumped 39 per cent, but buyers are now required to deposit 40 per cent of the purchase price to try to curb rising prices. Average price: RMB 3,961 (£426) per sq ft. Auckland, New Zealand 2 Annual price growth in Auckland jumped 25.4 per cent, leading to lower rates of home ownership. It's considered to be New Zealand's most cosmopolitan city. Waterfront estates, especially close to the Waitemata Harbour, are considered the place to live. Average house price: NZ$790 (£383) per sq ft. Istanbul, Turkey 3 Property prices in this Unesco World Heritage Site straddling Europe and Asia grew 25 per cent, according to Knight Frank's Global Cities Index. The weakening of the Turkish lira against the American dollar and British pound brought increased foreign investment in property last year. Sariyer is one of the most desirable residential enclaves and in November, 7,000 marathon runners will skirt pricey Besiktas. Average house price: 291 lira (£72) per sq ft. Sydney, Australia 4 Local and foreign investors in Sydney, as well as downsizers, drove a 19.9 per cent surge in property prices. Michelle Ciesielski of Knight Frank Australia says low interest rates and investment in infrastructure is attracting local investors. Most foreign investors are from Asia, many sending their children to school or university in the city with a population of 4.5 million. Properties nearest Sydney's business quarter and harbour average AU$2,038,000 (£1.1 million) for a house and AU$887,500 (£482,650) for an apartment. Sydney's marathon in September is one of the world's largest, with 34,000 runners. Ave house price: AU$237 (£129) per sq ft. Shanghai, China 5 A total of 255 luxury apartments and houses worth over 20 million yuan (£2,176,666) each sold in the first two months of 2016, according to Knight Frank. Favourable policies including the reduction of mortgage rates and taxation, the new supply of luxury homes and the high land prices are combining to fuel the property market. Prices have soared by 18.2 per cent. Average house price: RMB 3,627 (£390) per sq ft. Budapest, Hungary 6 Budapest is the strongestperforming capital city within Knight Frank's Index, where prices increased by 16.3 per cent in 2015. The city's value combined with an exclusive investment immigration bond programme for Chinese nationals, fast tracking residency to six months instead of five years, has fuelled demand. Bisected by the Danube, Budapest's hilly Buda side is more expensive than Pest. Average house price: €111 (£88) per sq ft. Stockholm, Sweden 7 Low interest rates and an undersupply of new homes caused prices to climb by 15.6 per cent in Stockholm - one of Europe's fastestgrowing cities. Östermalm is one of the most expensive places to live. Ave house price: 5,271 krone (£454) per sq ft. Gothenburg, Sweden 8 Prices rose by 14.4 per cent in 2015 in Gothenburg. A new residential area of the city is being planned in Älvstaden to provide 15,000 new homes. The city hosts one of the world's smallest marathons, with 1,000 competitors in October. Ave house price: 3,716 krone (£320) per sq ft. Vancouver, USA 9 Vancouver is North America's property hotspot, with prices rising 12.9 per cent in 2015. Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Associates says: ""Demand is extremely strong, with stock shortages causing prices to rise significantly."" Low interest rates and the Canadian dollar having dropped against the US dollar have made property investment attractive. The city hosts one of the world's most scenic urban marathons, where 5,000 competitors run through parks, past beaches and alongside the seawall. Ave house price: CAN$476 (£261) per sq ft. Ljubljana, Slovenia 10 A limited supply of housing and the strict restrictions on land planning have contributed to the 12.8 per cent house price growth in the Slovenian city. Average house prices are unavailable. Durban, South Africa 11 Values saw an 11.6 per cent price growth last year in the busy port and manufacturing hub. An increasing number of buyers from China and Dubai are looking at Durban and Umhlanga is one of the most desirable neighbourhoods, with new beachfront apartments and family homes in the Mount Edgecombe Estate some of the most expensive in the country. Average house prices are unavailable. Portland, USA somethings are flocking 12Twenty-to Portland in Oregon, where a boom in the technology and creative marketing industry is pushing both home values and rents higher. Asking prices rose by 11.5 per cent last year and bidding wars are becoming commonplace, with some homes selling for US$150,000 (£105,615) above the list price, according to agent Rachel Freed at Urban Nest Realty. Ave house price: US$318,800 (£210,344) per sq ft. London, UK 13 On average, prices across London rose 11.4 per cent to the end of 2015, fuelled by activity in zones three and four. However, values in the luxury core of the city have dropped 10 per cent due to stamp duty hikes and oil and gas companies pulling executives out of the UK, according to Wendy Perez at Knight Frank. Average house price: £657 per sq ft. Amsterdam, Netherlands 14 The canalside homes overlooking the river Amstel are the most popular homes in the city where, on average, values rose 10.9 per cent. Small pads in the outer suburbs start from around €100,000 (£79,737), with a large house in the centre selling for around €5 million (£3.99 million). Average house price: €486 (£382) per sq ft. Copenhagen, Denmark 15 Demand for housing is finally strengthening after a slow recovery from the global financial crisis. Prices rose by 10.8 per cent last year. Average house price: 2,800 kroner (£296) per sq ft. Beijing, China 16 Thirtysomethings, are queuing up to buy luxury homes in Beijing. Prices rose by 10.4 per cent last year. Average house price: RMB 3,300 (£355) per sq ft. San Francisco, USA 17 Prices grew by 10.4 per cent in California's tech city last year, and fears of a property bubble are growing. Analysts at the ratings agency Fitch say they market is ""overheating"", and values have ""risen to a level unsupportable by area income"" driven up by the arrival of tech workers who are flooding the region. Average house price: $868 (£603) per sq ft. Malmö, Sweden 18 Values rose 10.2 per cent last year in Sweden's third largest city, which has shed its industrial roots to attract biotech and IT companies. The prestigious Fridhem neighbourhood in western Malmö is within walking distance of beaches and the city centre. Average house price: 2,569 krone (£221) per sq ft. Seattle, USA 19 This west coast city has seen strong migration, low unemployment, increasing wages and heavy expansion of the local tech scene. Construction of new housing has not kept pace with the strong demand from increasingly wealthy homebuyers, meaning prices continue upwards at a rate of 10 per cent a year. Average house price: US$400 (£277) per sq ft. Melbourne, Australia 20 Melbourne has been named the world's most liveable city for the fifth year in a row by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Values grew by 9.9 per cent in 2015. Detached houses with large gardens are the most common properties outside the inner city, and its most exclusive neighbourhood is Toorak. Average house price: AU$816 (£442) per sq ft. Dallas, USA 21 Prices rose by 9.5 per cent last year. Dallas has a strong industrial and financial sector and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. Average house prices: US$139 (£97) sq ft. Toronto, Canada 22 Toronto's £( property market is red hot, with the average price of a detached house in the suburbs achieving CA$1.2 million (£654,174) last month. Low interest rates, strong employment and immigration are positive economic factors, as well as Chinese investors buying family homes for the full asking price. Price growth was 9.5 per cent last year. Average house price: CAN$389 (£213) per sq ft. Oslo, Norway 23 Property in Oslo costs 9.2 per cent more than it did a year ago. The uplift is partly caused by low interest rates and weakened economic activity, which is a result of falling oil prices. But the city boasts some of the country's highest earners. Wealthy Norwegian families and most expats tend to live in the west of the city. Average house price: 5,378 kroner (£460) per sq ft. Reykjavik, Iceland 24 The number of tourists visiting the Icelandic city is putting upward pressure on property prices. According to Knight Frank, values rose by 9.2 per cent last year. Average house price: 29,800 krona. (£167) per sq ft. Cape Town, South Africa 25 Atlantic Seaboard is the most sought-after area in Cape Town, boasting ocean views, sandy beaches and beautiful homes. Prices grew by 8.6 per cent last year, with homes costing 1,737,706 rand (£82,861). ""There is considerable interest from foreign investors looking to take advantage of the weak rand,"" says Brendan Miller, of Sotheby's. Average house price: 2,175 rand (£106) per sq ft. Porto, Portugal 26 Prices rose by 8.6 per cent in Porto last year. Foz is an exclusive and sought-after district on the ocean front, with grand four-bedroom properties priced at around €800,000 (£637,231). Average house price: €128 (£100) per sq ft.

"Oslo and Bergen: Norwegian charm, beauty, art",Norway,"Norway in early spring - with its gray skies, snow-covered countryside, icy streets, and misty rains - is perhaps not everyone's idea of paradise, but it has its upside. You have the place more or less to yourself, or at least you don't have to share it with the raging hordes of selfie-snapping backpackers who descend on Scandinavia in the summer. As for my husband and me, we started in Oslo, the laid-back, friendly capital nestled among hills at the end of the Oslofjord on the country's rugged southeast coast. From there, we took the train west to Bergen, built around a harbor on the semicircular sliver of land inside a bowl of mountains. Our itinerary was defined by the two talks my husband, a university professor, was giving in each city. The time surrounding the talks was ours to use as we wished. Oslo is marvelously pretty, with a capacious, lively waterfront; a necklace of surrounding, heavily wooded hills (some of them skiable); and blocks and blocks of neoclassical buildings painted in soft pastels - an astonishingly lovely palette that probably owed something to the gloomy, glowing early spring sunlight. So it comes as a bit of a surprise to learn that for most of its long history (Oslo was founded in the 11th century), the place was a backwater, a poor relation to Stockholm and Copenhagen. It was not until the 1950s, a mere eyeblink after its occupation by Nazi Germany, that the city remade itself as an expansive, cosmopolitan, world-class capital. What struck me first was not the city's beauty or even its distinctly Scandinavian charm, but how quiet the place was. Horns do not blare, radios do not scream, and pedestrians, when they talk, keep their voices at conversational level. There are no blinking billboards or road-rage face-offs (at least none that I saw). Rather, civility reigns, so much so that I kept thinking I'd been swept back in time to a decade or so before my own midcentury birth. With my husband occupied, I started by wandering around on my own, street map in hand, beginning with the neighborhood surrounding our excellent, reasonably priced hotel, the Savoy. As it is only two blocks from Oslo's main drag, Karl Johans gate, which stretches from Oslo's main train station on its eastern end to the impressively low-key royal palace in its public parkland on its western end, I was in no danger of getting lost and in high danger of getting an attack of real estate envy. I turned right into the royal parkland, crossed it under milky-gray skies, and kept going, taking in the quiet, tree-lined streets of elegant 19th-century apartment houses, breathing in the aromas coming from Oslo's omnipresent coffee-pastry shops, and finally stumbling into Embla Keramikk, a ceramics studio where I debated with myself for a good half-hour before deciding it would not be wise to schlep ceramics from Oslo to Bergen to London and finally home to New Jersey. Not that I didn't want to buy, at the very least, a fanciful dog figure or, even better, a bowl with a zebra's head peeking out of it. From there, I skirted the National Theater, with its twin statues of Henrik Ibsen and the lesser-known Bjornstjerne Bjornson (winner of the 1903 Nobel Prize in literature). I continued past the vaguely Soviet-looking, brown-brick Radhus (City Hall), with its two imposing square towers, to the Akershus Fortress, dating to the Middle Ages, with its battlements, towers, ramparts, marching grounds, stables, prison grounds, cannon, and towers - plus Norway's Resistance Museum, commemorating the country's World War II history. Although it was late afternoon, and many buildings were about to close, I was able to walk the entire circular Fortress Trail, taking in the general sweep of the place and admiring the harbor. On the opposite side, I could see the sleek, chic shopping district of Aker Brygge, with the stunning Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art, its roofs looking like two sails fully unfurled. As our time was short and the ferries weren't running, my husband and I had to forgo a visit to Oslo's Viking Ship Museum on the Bygdoy peninsula. We chose instead to walk through neighborhoods of big, old, solid houses to Oslo's famous Frogner Park, home of the outdoor-sculpture wonderland created by Gustav Vigeland. All I can say is that you have to see it to believe it: more than 200 massive, playful, nude, and very real (if not realistic) sculptures portraying human life in all its variety, cast in bronze, granite, and iron. You stand there staring, jaw dropped, tears flowing. The astonishing vision, which more often than not is crawling with schoolchildren, is topped by a 20-meter-high obelisk of yearning, intertwined figures. After Vigeland, the atmosphere, and art, of the National Gallery, a huge, 19th-century monolith of a building, seemed somewhat tame, despite the many masterpieces on the walls, including some by Norway's most famous artist, Edvard Munch. More on Munch later. If you can't make it to Oslo's Munch Museum or Bergen's KODE collection, you'll have to see the Munch offerings here, which include one of four versions of The Scream. Next stop: Bergen. Throughout seven hours, the Bergen Railway took us west over one of Europe's highest mountain plateaus, where it climbed through thick forests of fir trees, small villages, and, finally, above the tree line, glaciers, and rivers of ice, before descending again to what must be one of the world's most charming urban idylls. Bergen - which, by the way, is one of Europe's wettest cities - was dry and, like Oslo, almost entirely tourist-free. On my first morning there, I had the old wharf, a former center of the league of Hanseatic merchants - a German trading company that operated in northern climes from about 1360 to 1760 - almost entirely to myself. Now a reconstructed World Heritage Site, Bryggen, as the area is called, is the city's oldest part, a string of pumpkin- and tomato-color wooden, gabled warehouses, occupied almost entirely by knickknack shops. I visited the Bryggens Museum, which was built over the remains of the city's earliest medieval settlement and which tells the story of the city's many fires and rebirths. Here, too, I visited the Hanseatic Museum, housed in two 18th-century wooden (and unheated) buildings where fish and cod-liver oil were once pressed and stored. Workers and apprentices lived there, too, running the Norwegian branch of the Hanseatic League. Speaking of fish, I loved the Bergen Aquarium, at the end of the Nordnes peninsula, with its playful sea lions, shark tunnel, sparkling Norwegian piranhas, salmon and cod, and small, jewel-like tropical beauties. If fish don't get you going, meander through the aquarium's neighborhoods. Seemingly storybook-small wooden houses line cobblestone alleys, painted an array of pretty pale colors, and so peaceful that it's hard to imagine ordinary human beings eat, sleep, argue, raise children, and watch TV here. It was hard to decide on one last cultural excursion, but we finally chose the KODE Art Museums of Bergen, four buildings in the heart of the city (as well as the homes of Edvard Grieg and two other composers). Unlike many of Bergen's smaller tourist sites, the main KODE museums remain open all year, so we were able to take in one of the world's largest and most important Munch collections, housed in KODE 3. Munch's works, unlike those of other world-class artists, remain almost entirely in Norway and, hence, are not often seen in person, in all their vibrant, richly colored, and often muscularly optimistic power. The Scream, Munch's oeuvre, is so much bigger and more interesting than that one iconic image beloved by undergraduates, that I wanted to let out a scream. But I controlled myself and continued on to admire the other pieces in KODE 3's collection from Norway's late-19th-century ""golden age,"" as well as period furnishings and decorative objects. Our final foray in Bergen had us ascending the Floyen, one of the mountains that surround the city, overlooking the city center and harbor with its bright red and yellow ships. It's usually accessible by funicular, but at the moment, the railway was closed for maintenance. No matter. The steep hike, up flights of steps built into the hill and then onto public pathways, rewarded us with ""wow""-inducing views, not to mention hearty appetites. Next stop: dinner at the Bare restaurant, in the Radisson Blu Hotel Norge. All I will say is that, concluding a visit to a place of such astonishing natural beauty, comprising forested mountains and endlessly sparkling fjords and sea, we had one of the best meals of our lives."

In a statement Wednesday after a two-day meeting, the Fed stuck to its longstanding plan to move carefully on raising the benchmark federal-funds rate, which it has held between 0.25% and 0.50% since December, when it raised short-term rates after holding them near zero since 2008. Policy makers want to give themselves room to act at their June 14-15 gathering should they see enough encouraging developments, without signaling to investors that action is likely. Among the concerns: lingering worry over low inflation at home, slow-growing overseas economies and the potential British exit from the European Union. Eurozone finance ministers will convene next week or at the latest the week after to try to complete a bailout deal with the Greek government, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Wednesday. After a tentative meeting for Thursday was called off when talks ran into difficulties, European Council President Donald Tusk said earlier Wednesday that eurozone finance ministers should hold a meeting on Greece in the coming days to avoid prolonged uncertainty. Mr. Dijsselbloem, who presides over the meetings, said creditors need a little more time to work with Athens on the legal possibilities for a contingency mechanism that would trigger further austerity if Greece misses targets. EU governments that are set to consider visa-free travel deals with Turkey, Ukraine and Georgia are weighing a new policy that would allow the bloc to quickly suspend or even scrap the arrangements, if need be, according to a Franco-German paper viewed by The Wall Street Journal. European governments soon will decide whether to move ahead with visa-free travel at a time when many Europeans are wary of mass migration. With the deals, more than 120 million people from neighboring countries would be free to start entering the bloc without visas in coming months. On Thursday, senior member-state officials are expected to discuss the visa deals and appropriate safeguard mechanisms during meetings in Brussels.   IN FOCUS:  It's a busy day of earnings and data in the region Thursday. Handelsbanken thinks Swedish retail sales for March at 0730 GMT should show continued growth, but at a rate likely to resemble 2013-2014 more than the strong rate of 2015. Norwegian Labour Force Survey unemployment for February is expected to remain steady at 4.8% after a surprisingly sharp spike in the previous month that was driven by a decline in employment and a further rise in the labour force. Handelsbanken expects retail spending advanced by 1.4% month-on-month in March, following a 0.5% drop in February. Its estimate is based on a model using debit card data which suggests that retail spending rose sharply in March, before contracting substantially in April.   FOREX:  EUR/NOK 0250 GMT 9.2184-234 Previous 9.2380-430 %Chg -0.21  EUR/SEK 0250 GMT 9.1492-592 Previous 9.1596-696 %Chg -0.11  USD/NOK 0250 GMT 8.1590-650 Previous 8.1584-644 %Chg 0.01  USD/SEK 0250 GMT 8.0977-1067 Previous 8.0903-93 %Chg 0.09  NORDIC CURRENCIES:  A Swedish survey of consumer and business confidence published Wednesday pointed to continued strong economic growth in the Nordic state, Nordea Bank analyst Andreas Wallstrom said. The reading for consumer confidence for April was 97.1 down from 99.7 in March while the level for manufacturing confidence was 107.9 from 112.5. Mr. Wallstrom said that the numbers equate to GDP growth of around 4% in annual terms. The Swedish krona weakened slightly versus the euro after the data.   STOCK INDEXES:  OMXN40 1468.68 +0.22% OMXS30 1386.78 -0.22% OBX     544.27 +2.14% OMXC20 1002.3  +0.66% OMXH25 3158.79 +0.04%  Brent crude: $46.73   NORDIC MARKETS:  Most Nordic markets rebounded from early session losses to close modestly higher Wednesday, as investors digested a slew of earnings in the region and remained cautious ahead of the FOMC rate decision. A weaker dollar and data from the American Petroleum Institute that showed U.S. crude inventories likely decreased by 1.1 million barrels last week, pushed oil prices to fresh 2016 highs, and sent Oslo's oil-heavy OBX index sharply higher on the day.   ENERGY:  Oil prices surrendered earlier gains as concerns of a lingering glut weighed on sentiment, but analysts said volatility is expected in the short-term as traders waver between declining production and growing inventories. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in June traded at $45.19 a barrel at 0245 GMT, down $0.14 in the Globex electronic session. June Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange fell $0.20 to $46.73 a barrel. Oil prices reached a new 2016 high in volatile U.S. trading after the Fed left rates unchanged, signaling less concern about the health of the U.S. economy. Investors should take comfort from a relatively market neutral Federal Open Market Committee statement and the improvement in fundamental will likely encourage traders to beef up their already bullish positions in coming days, said ANZ Research. However, report of a bigger-than-expected growth in the U.S. crude inventories has spurred some risk-averse behavior. The latest data from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude stocks expanded by 2 million barrels in the week ended April 22, much larger than the 1.1-million barrel decline estimated by the American Petroleum Group. Moreover, while crude production edged lower in the same period, a 15,000-barrel a day fall was hardly encouraging. ""Profit-taking is mainly responsible for prices decline this morning,"" said a Singapore-based marine fuel trader.

Pomp as Sweden's king celebrates 70th birthday,Norway,"Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf celebrated his 70th birthday Saturday joined by royals from Europe and beyond, as Swedes lined the streets to wish him many happy returns. Neighbouring Norway's royals did not however attend, staying at home as their nation reels from a deadly helicopter crash which killed 13 oil workers the day before. On a day of pageantry and colour, the Swedish king was cheered by onlookers as he reviewed the royal guard. Later Gustaf and his family appeared on the palace balcony, cheered by thousands. The list of invited royalty included Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Philippe of Belgium, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, Princess Takamado of Japan and Jordan's Prince Raad bin Zeid and Princess Majda Raad Zeid. But members of the Norwegian royal family cancelled after a helicopter carrying North Sea oil workers crashed on Friday near Bergen, Norway's second biggest city. Born on April 30, 1946, Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus Bernadotte was only nine months old when his father, Prince Gustaf Adolf, was killed in a plane crash in Denmark. He assumed the throne in 1973 following the death of his grandfather, the long-reigning Gustav VI Adolf. The king has for many years struggled to shed his image as a car-mad playboy after being thrust onto the throne at age 27. His finest hour came in January 2005, after some 500 Swedes lost their lives in the tsunami that swept across tourist resorts in southeast Asia. ""What if I, just like the king in the fairytales, could make everything all right and end the story with 'and then they all lived happily ever after',"" he said. ""But I, just like you, am just a grieving, searching, fellow man,"" he said in a speech at the time. je/mt"
Saudi plan to end oil ‘addiction’: How will it change the kingdom?,Norway,"Saudi Arabia has announced a grand strategy to wean the kingdom off oil and create an investment-driven economy. Yet between the lines of its vision to kick what royals are calling an “oil addiction” are clear steps for Saudi to kick its other habit – reliance on US economic and military support. Such a shift has the potential to profoundly reshape Saudi Arabia. But it is unclear whether a newly “unbound” kingdom would play a productive role in the region or expand its proxy wars against Iran and inflame the Middle East. And while some observers predict that the 2030 plan will carry with it a wave of social changes, the closed, conservative kingdom may find a way to circumvent such influences. In unveiling the so-called Saudi Vision 2030 plan, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman laid out a bold strategy: reducing dependence on oil sales, increasing investments abroad to over $2 trillion, cutting unemployment to 7 percent, privatizing state-owned industries such as telecom and airports, and increasing the private sector’s share of GDP to 65 percent. A driving factor behind the reforms, approved by the Saudi government on April 25, is the falling of crude prices from $100 per barrel in 2014 to around $40 this month. That pushed the Saudi budget deficit to $98 billion in 2015 and $87 billion this year. Under the plan, Saudi will sell off 5 percent of Aramco, the largest company in the world at a value of $2 to 10 trillion, diverting the profits to a sovereign wealth fund worth over $2 trillion to invest across the world. It would be the largest of its kind and more than double Norway’s $870 billion oil fund. “Saudi is basically diversifying away from the dependency on one revenue source, one country source, and one market to many markets,” says John Sfakianakis, former economic adviser to the Saudi government and Riyadh-based director of economics research at the Gulf Research Center. Saudi officials privately praise not only the economic independence gained by the scheme, but the political freedom it would bring from the US, which at around 1.4 million barrels per day is the second largest importer of Saudi oil. According to the theory, freeing Saudi Arabia of the oil market would liberate Riyadh from its political obligations to its oil importers – particularly the United States, whose overtures to Iran have upset the Saudis and where Saudis perceive growing “anti-Saudi” sentiment. “Saudis today feel they have the resources, the confidence, the military, and the willpower to be a major player, and they are ready to go independent,” says Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, Gulf observer and Emirati professor of political science. Saudi fears reached their peak with Congress’s introduction of the so-called 9/11 bill, which would strip Saudi Arabia’s sovereign immunity and allow victims of the 9/11 attacks to sue the Saudi government. In response, Riyadh has threatened to sell off $750 billion in US assets and treasury securities, out of fear that they could be frozen by US courts. “This bill was a kind of a warning to Saudi that there are risks to their investments in the US as long as the atmosphere is anti-Saudi,” says David Ottaway, longtime Saudi observer and scholar at Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.  Call to Arms Perhaps the most ambitious goal of the 2030 plan is for the creation of a homegrown military industry that would account for half of all Saudi military purchases – up from 2 percent today. In 2015, Saudi Arabia ranked third globally with military spending of $87.2 billion on arms and military equipment. More than one-fifth of that was purchased from the US. Saudi Arabia has already begun manufacturing spare parts and basic ammunition, the 2030 document states, but under the new plan a Saudi government-owned company will expand the initiative to munitions and “higher value and more complex equipment such as military aircraft.” The calls for a military industry are tied with Saudi Arabia’s growing military assertiveness under King Salman. Pressed by the advance of perceived Iranian proxies, Saudi launched a year-long war in Yemen in March 2015. Late last year, Riyadh announced a military coalition of 34 Muslim states to “fight terrorism,” with the prospect of sending military expeditions in Libya and elsewhere in the region. Although the Obama administration has signed off on a record $60 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia since 2010, with tens of billions more in the pipeline, Saudi officials express frustration that US arms sales often face “delays” and are considered “politically sensitive.” Securing a domestic supply line will be “critical” for a more active Saudi, particularly if Washington may not approve of Riyadh’s future military ventures.        “Saudi had a shortage of munitions in its war in Yemen, and the US was slow to supply them – they don’t want to go through that again,” Mr. Ottaway says. “To become more independent in the military area, Saudi has recognized that it needs to get into the nitty-gritty – providing their own small arms, munitions, and armed personnel carriers.” An Opening? But these changes, however dramatic, may do little to shift internal social and political dynamics. The plan calls for opening to foreign direct investment, granting “green-card” residences to foreign nationals, boosting women’s participation in the workforce from 22 percent to 30 percent, and even investing $46 billion in the tourism sector over the next five years. Foreign companies have long had a presence in Saudi Arabia. Social media use is rampant and largely free; Saudi Arabia has the largest Twitter usage in the world. Yet these have not lessened human rights abuses or led to political representation in the kingdom. Saudi executed 47 people on a single day in January, cinemas are banned, and women are still unable to legally drive or open their own bank account. Even Prince Mohammed bin Salman seemed to backtrack from his initial support for women’s empowerment while promoting the vision, warning a few days after unveiling the plan that the “society is not convinced about women driving… it is up to Saudi society” to decide. Rather than Europe or even modern Arab states such as Tunisia, in its vision, Saudi Arabia may be copying a model farther to the east: China. “I think this is a model of a directed, authoritarian capitalism – which the Chinese are pulling off, other places are pulling off, and Saudi Arabia is looking to follow suit,” says F. Gregory Gause, Saudi expert and professor of international affairs at Texas A&M; University. “There are theories that the stronger the private sector gets, the more it will demand political rights – but we will not see that in Saudi.”"
WATCH: Wall of flames surrounds Canadian town as residents are evacuated,Norway,"MORE than 88,000 people have been forced to evacuate as devastating forest fires threaten to engulf an entire Canadian city. A state of emergency has been declared across the province of Alberta as authorities battle to control the monster blaze. Whole neighbourhoods have been torched by the wildfire which officials say began on Sunday, although the exact cause is still unclear. Unseasonably warm temperatures and bone-dry conditions have enabled the fire to rip through more than 25,000 acres of the oil-rich province. YOUTUBE HORROR: Cars dodge flames licking the road as the gigantic blaze tears through the forest Videos shot by fleeing residents capture the hellish inferno advancing on the rural town. Visibility is low as the smouldering wreckage of the surrounding forest chokes daylight into darkness. Refuge centres for the evacuees have been set up in the nearby city of Edmonton. First minister Rachel Notley called for “the biggest evacuation in the history of the province” after 1,600 structures were destroyed in just three days, including a newly-built school. ""We will get through this and we will come out stronger on the other side,"" she said.

Norway: Environmental hero or hypocrite?,Norway,"With killer whales swimming in the pristine fjord and sea eagles soaring above it, the scene offers a postcard-perfect image of Norway. “It is a paradise where nature can develop undisturbed,” says Anne-Line Thingnes Forsund, who was born and raised in Vevring, beside the Forde fjord. But last year the Norwegian authorities approved a plan that would allow millions of tonnes of industrial waste to be dumped into the fjord, drawing criticism that the pristine area will be disturbed. The project developer, Nordic Mining, says that in return 170 jobs would be created to excavate titanium oxide, a mineral used in teeth whitening and other products. The move has sparked the ire of locals and environmentalists. It has also unleashed criticism of Norway, long seen as one of the leading lights of the climate change movement for its largesse in sponsoring green projects abroad: it gave $1bn to stop deforestation in Brazil and has a similar scheme in Indonesia[https://ig.ft.com/sites/land-rush-investment/indonesia/].  “We are telling everybody else what they should be doing but we are not doing it ourselves,” says Nina Jensen, head of the WWF in Norway.  In areas as diverse as coal mining, oil and gas exploration, forestry, peat bogs, fossil fuel subsidies and emissions reduction, Norway stands accused of not practising what it preaches. Critics argue that the type of behaviour it rails against abroad — putting jobs and growth above protecting the environment — is exactly what it is doing at home, leading to charges of hypocrisy.  “We are frustrated most of the time because jobs go before the environment. To some extent it is hypocrisy. Sometimes it seems easier to achieve something abroad than in Norway itself,” says Arild Hermstad, head of the Future In Our Hands, Norway’s leading environmental lobby group.  ‘Far from perfect at home’ It is not just environmentalists angered by this. “Norway always comes across as a moraliser on environmental matters but I think there’s a lot to criticise it about at home where it’s far from perfect,” says the chief executive of a Swedish industrial company, who asked to remain anonymous. James Hansen, the US climate researcher and former Nasa scientist, argued last year that Norway should leave its remaining fossil fuels in the ground, arguing that saying they were in the middle of a “green shift” while drilling for oil was a “nonsense”. “To leave Norway’s share of resources untouched would be an act of leadership that would go down in the history books worldwide,” he wrote in a letter to Norway’s prime minister. The stakes are high in the wake of the climate accord agreed in Paris in December — which was formally signed in New York on April 23 — to limit warming of the planet to less than 2C from pre-industrial times. Norway has been well regarded for doing more than almost any other nation to fight deforestation as well as putting climate change action at the heart of its $855bn sovereign wealth fund. In Vevring, a town of just 300 residents, Ms Forsund, head of the local action group[http://fjordaksjonen.org/english-information.html] against the mine, calls the plan “madness”. The fjord is a popular spawning ground for fish, the location of several salmon farms as well as a destination for cruise ships. Various groups involved in tourism and seafood — two of Norway’s biggest industries behind petroleum — have spoken out over the plans, while a British marine biologist called the development “mad” and “like returning to the 18th century”.  “It is unbelievable that we are paying so much to protect the rainforest when they are going to let mining waste into our fjord — an underwater rainforest — in Norway. This is gross hypocrisy,” says Ms Forsund.  Nordic Mining promotes the project as an example of how Norway can survive as oil and gas slowly but inevitably disappears from the energy mix. It argues that the waste will be pumped to the bottom of the fjord, a depth of 300m, well below where the typical habitat of wild salmon. Norway is one of the few countries that allows mining waste to be dumped at sea. The company says studies show that marine life tends to return to the bottom of such fjords within a few years.  “This is positive,” Roald Kvammen, a Vevring resident, told local media. “We need these jobs.” The Forde fjord is far from an isolated incident. Environmentalists point to a string of projects where jobs in isolated communities have trumped other considerations. These projects are partly explained by Norway’s slowing economy, which has seen growth stall and unemployment rise by a third in the past two years as the country has felt the sharp effect of lower oil prices. One proposal is to open up vast swaths of sea inside the Arctic Circle for oil exploration. Oil and gas are already being pumped from the southern Barents Sea but this year auctions for the first new acreage in 20 years will be awarded, particularly along the country’s Arctic border with Russia. Assisting exploration The energy companies are helped by a tax break of 78 per cent to set off against exploration costs, something Ms Jensen calls a “hidden subsidy” which by her calculation amounts to NKr140bn ($17bn) in this year’s licensing round. “You really shouldn’t be investing your money in something you should be ending,” she adds. Government officials dispute that the tax measures are subsidies, arguing that they help ensure exploration. They point to the UK, on the other side of the North Sea[http://video.ft.com/4870221563001/North-Sea-hit-by-fall-in-oil-price/Companies], where the industry is struggling, as an example of what can happen without the right incentives.  Even more controversial is a push to open up the Lofoten islands and Vesteralen archipelago in northern Norway for oil exploration. With the largest cold water coral reef in the world, Lofoten is widely regarded as the most spectacular place in Norway. The current centre-right government has ruled out any drilling there while it is in power.  However, both the chief executive of government-controlled Statoil and Oslo’s oil minister have recently called for the area to be opened up after next year’s elections. Eldar Saetre[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-13/norway-oil-executives-warn-on-long-term-supply-as-elections-loom] of Statoil has warned that unless the drilling ban is lifted, the precipitous decline in Norway’s oil production would continue — it has halved since 2000. “It is these kinds of calls that make you think: why the hell are we doing this? [Opening up Lofoten] would be very short-term thinking trumping long-term thinking,” says Ms Jensen.  Cries of hypocrisy were also heard when a state-owned company opened a coal mine on the Svalbard archipelago on the very day in 2014 that Norway’s parliament began discussing whether its sovereign wealth fund should pull out of coal investments. “It is true there is a certain amount of double standards here,” says one senior government official. “But we think it is better to take a stance on climate change with the oil fund than do nothing, and the coal mine itself is pretty small.” Vidar Helgesen, the environment minister, argues that Norway is a “paradox nation” because of its status as western Europe’s largest producer of oil and gas.    “We have significant wealth derived from fossil fuels but at the same time we are a policy lab for ideas that seek to undermine the market for oil,” he says. As an example, he cites heavy subsidies for electric cars, which have helped Norway set sales records for many models. Early last year, more than two-thirds of the European sales of Volkswagen’s eGolf were in Norway.  On the broader criticism, Mr Helgesen says the government wants to ensure a gradual shift away from fossil fuels as well as create jobs. “In individual cases, there will be trade-offs between industries. That is not a matter of hypocrisy. It is the kind of dilemma you will have in any country,” he adds.  The minister calls the claim that Norway does not do at home what it preaches abroad “a fundamentally flawed assumption — we are not telling Indonesia that they should not make money from their forests”. Poor record Perhaps the most pointed criticism of Norway’s record is in the very areas where it is seeking to have an effect overseas: forestry and peat bogs. Norway paid its final instalment of a $1bn donation to Brazil late last year for reducing its rate of deforestation by three-quarters. It has offered large sums to Liberia to protect 30 per cent of its forests by 2020, as well as other countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Environmentalists, though, are worried about the protection of Norway’s own woodland. Most of its forests are relatively young, with just 2.4 per cent that are more than 160 years old and classified as old growth, the type that supports the most biodiversity. Mr Helgesen says there has been a recent improvement but admits it is from “a poor base”.  Similarly, Norway is encouraging Indonesia to protect its peat bogs, a source of greenhouse gases when burnt, as in last year’s big fires in the Southeast Asian country. But Norway itself has drained a third of its peat bogs in the past 100 years, while less than 5 per cent are protected. That contrasts with a goal of 17 per cent set as part of UN biodiversity targets for 2020. “If you look at the last century, we have a lot to make up,” Mr Helgesen concedes. He says measures that would hurt the agriculture or forestry sectors are politically difficult to implement. “It’s perfectly clear that when you have government interventions to protect the environment that go against traditional livelihoods, that is bound to be met with resistance.”  Instead, he claims that one krone goes further in fighting climate change abroad than in Norway. “Cost effectiveness is a consideration. If Norwegian money can result in more carbon dioxide reductions abroad than through similar actions in Norway, that is better for the global climate. But that is not to say we are not going through a transition in Norway too,” he says.  Norway is one of the few European countries[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Total_greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_countries_(including_international_aviation_and_excluding_LULUCF),_1990_-_2013_(million_tonnes_of_CO2_equivalents)_updated.png] where greenhouse gas emissions[https://www.ssb.no/en/natur-og-miljo/statistikker/klimagassn/aar-endelige] are higher than they were in 1990. CO2 emissions are 23 per cent higher than they were in 1990, while total GHG emissions are up 2.4 per cent largely due to the growth of the oil and gas industry but also partly due to increased road traffic. By contrast, both Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by about a quarter over the same period.  “We are winning the championship on what we do environmentally abroad but in our own country it is like we are not even in the competition,” says Mr Hermstad. “When it comes to the difficult decisions and the people might be a bit angry, then we can’t do it.” In Vevring, Ms Forsund is keeping up the fight against the mine. The permit to allow the discharge was finally approved in February after an appeal was dismissed. She says: “If Norway is willing to do this [open the mine], it can put pressure on poor countries to abandon their environmental standards. If Norway can’t do this, then who can?”"
Shetland energy development not the sunny prospect it was,Norway,"For the storm-hit oil and gas sector, the UK’s northern archipelago of Shetland looks like a sunlit haven between the turbulent waters of the North Sea and the Atlantic. On Monday, oil company Total will formally inaugurate a gas processing plant on Shetland that will process the output of its new £3.5bn Laggan Tormore field, west of the islands. The presence of Amber Rudd[https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/politics/holyrood/916982/scottish-energy-policy-being-squandered-by-remote-control-from-westminster/], UK energy secretary, will be a demonstration of how important ministers feel Laggan Tormore could be in reviving the British oil and gas sector. Peak capacity from the field is estimated at 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day — 5 per cent of UK total offshore production — and Total says it expects to invest another £1bn in other fields made accessible by the Laggan Tormore infrastructure. Yet behind the good cheer, Shetlanders say their islands are far from immune to the oil price collapse. “We thought we were at the beginning of another oil boom — there was a colossal amount of work over the past few years,” said Drew Ratter, a local councillor and former chairman of the Shetland Charitable Trust, the islands’ oil fund. But Mr Ratter said the sector “went up like a rocket and down like a stick”, with low oil prices meaning field developers were regretting their investment. “The North Sea was not a cheap place to produce oil from and the Atlantic is significantly worse,” he said. “They are now completing projects [in the Shetland area] that in some cases they wish they’d never started.” BP is this month stationing a huge new floating production vessel in waters west of Shetland to extend the life of fields there for decades. But it has already put on hold[http://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2016/04/01/gas-sweetening-plant-at-sullom-voe-put-on-hold] its plans for a £500m gas plant in Shetland.  The oil slump is affecting traffic at the port in Lerwick, the Shetland capital. “A couple of years out we could see exploration was drying up,” said Sandra Laurenson, chief executive of the Lerwick Port Authority. “With the oil price collapsing there is unlikely to be any significant spend . . . in new field development.” For Shetland, an archipelago halfway to Norway with just 23,000 people, the oil era is credited with attracting needed immigrants, transforming island infrastructure and making full employment the norm. A past levy on oil landings negotiated by astute Shetlanders paid for generous leisure and welfare facilities as well as the £200m charitable trust. But Mr Ratter said the level of provision may not be sustainable. The council has been cutting spending along with other local authorities across Scotland whose budgets are under pressure. This could be worsened by falls in income from its own oil-related rents and harbour fees. There are also concerns that the benefits of energy development are not reaching the Shetlanders as much as they used to. Locals say it has become increasingly hard to get jobs with BP, which runs the huge Sullom Voe oil terminal among low green hills on the Shetland mainland. BP appears to be “treating Shetland like an offshore installation”, complains Gary Robinson, council political leader, with all workers required to stay in company accommodation. Total says more of the 80 permanent jobs at its gas plant are filled by locals, “the better for both the island and for Total”. Mr Robinson says islanders will be watching closely — “the jury is out on that one”. Despite the concerns, Shetland is suffering much less than Scotland’s oil capital of Aberdeen, where thousands of jobs have been shed. Cruise ships are coming in large numbers. Island fisheries and aquaculture are “doing well”, says Douglas Irvine, council economic development manager. Sea produce is worth about £350m a year to Shetland, far more than the £60m contributed by energy before the opening of Total’s gas plant. The council is keen to foster growth in tourism and renewable energy, though tapping the windswept archipelago’s most obvious resource would require an expensive connector to the Scottish mainland. Mr Robinson says oil and gas will be important to Shetland for decades to come but the downturn has been instructive. “It does emphasise the need for diversification,” he says."

Economy contracts as Scotland feels squeeze from North Sea,Norway,"The Scottish economy slipped back into contraction last month, according to research being published today. The Bank of Scotland purchasing managers' index has recorded a reading of 49.9 for May, down from the 50 mark posted in April. A reading greater than 50 signals expansion, while lower than that suggests contraction. The latest result provides further evidence that Scotland's economy is struggling to eke out any substantial growth. Last week the EY Scottish Item Club cut its forecast for growth in 2016 from 1.8 per cent to 1.2 per cent. In March, the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University downgraded its growth prediction from 2.2 per cent to 1.9 per cent. There are a few bright points in the PMI, with workforce numbers falling for a sixth month in a row. Respondents suggest that the decline is linked with problems in the oil and gas industry that have been rippling out into the wider Scottish economy for several months. The pace of job cuts is said to be broadly similar across the manufacturing and services sectors. Financial services firms are among those to have been adding staff, but general business services and travel, tourism and leisure are cited as ones where numbers have reduced. The most encouraging sign in the survey is a higher volume of new business ? The North Sea could go into a ""rapid and premature decline"" if oil bosses and government get their strategy wrong over the next two years, according to a report being unveiled today (Greig Cameron writes). Dozens of industry leaders and academics were interviewed by PwC for the report, called A Sea Change. It has found that 58 per cent of executives across Britain, Norway and the Netherlands are optimistic about the future, in spite of challenges presented by the low oil price. They feel that if the right steps are taken production could continue for several more decades, but there are concerns that if greater innovation, efficiency measures and collaboration do not happen over the next two years, then securing production for the long term will be much more difficult. Alison Baker, PwC's oil and gas leader for the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: ""We picked up a real sense of urgency to create one last cycle of success that will retain and generate jobs, stimulate growth and ensure security of energy supply. But this was matched by a level of frustration at the fundamental issues that need tackling to avert the risk of rapid and premature decline."" during May, giving a reading of 51.2, the joint best this year, although still below the long-term historical trend. Manufacturers led the increase in new business with a first rise in nine months and at the sharpest pace in that sector for 21 months. The expansion was more muted in the services sector. Graham Blair, regional director of small and medium enterprise banking at Bank of Scotland, said: ""Scotland's private sector will be encouraged by the quicker expansion in new business levels during May, even if the rise was at a relatively marginal pace. However, other areas of the economy are still struggling as job-shedding persists and backlogs decline further."""
How Norway quietly became a whaling powerhouse,Norway,"Thirty years ago, 88 countries signed a moratorium with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) prohibiting commercial whaling of any kind. As a signatory, Japan is often considered the naughty child of the moratorium, skirting rules, finding loopholes and receiving international slaps on the wrist. A four-ship Japanese whaling fleet returned from the Antarctic Sea in March with 333 dead minke whales: a legal hunt, under the IWC's terms, because it was considered a scientific expedition. Yet the hunt sparked outrage around the world, as activists called the scientific claims bogus and criticized the IWC as incompetent. Norway, however, takes their fondness for whaling one step further, having refused to sign the moratorium altogether. Iceland – also considered a whaling rebel – held out on the moratorium until 2002, when it signed the agreement with stipulations. Between 2005 and 2016, Norwegians killed 5,617 whales – fewer than the 5,436 whales killed in Japan and the 1,199 killed in Iceland. But in 2014 and 2015, Norway killed more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. ""Everyone’s been so focused on [Japan], and with the International Court of Justice focused on Japan, everyone has seemed to overlook Norway,"" Kate O'Connell, a marine wildlife consultant with the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), tells The Christian Science Monitor. ""It's time we take an in-depth look at Norwegian whaling."" Because commercial whaling in Norway is unbound from IWC restrictions, and therefore legal, accusations against the industry have become more difficult to pursue. Anti-whale hunt activists and politicians don't really know how to reprimand Norway, because the country plays by different rules. ""They appear to be complying with necessary scientific observations, by they are watering down their own regulations more and more,"" Astrid Fuchs, Whaling and Trade Program Manager for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, tells the Monitor. ""They are making it easier for more hunters to go after more whales in larger areas, with no one on board to monitor the whaling. With Norway, we can accuse them of really undermining the effectiveness of IWC – but it is not illegal exactly.""  Ms. O'Connell and three of her colleagues published a report on Norway's whaling industry through the AWI on Monday, emphasizing its low market value domestically and abroad. Fewer than five percent of Norwegians regularly eat whale meat, and those who do consume, on average, about half a pound of whale meat each year. To stimulate demand, the Norwegian government has subsidized the business and funded marketing initiatives for new meat cuts such as ""whale pastrami,"" and byproducts such as whale oil hand cream. Norway's whale exports to Japan have also seen complications. Last year, shipments were returned to Norway because they failed to meet Japan's rigorous health standards.  The Scandinavian country defends their practice on political and, perhaps surprisingly, environmental grounds. The Norwegian government says that Minke whales, which have been hunted along Norway's coast since at least medieval times, are not endangered in the region. Norwegian whaling argues its Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries is ""based on the principle of protection and sustainable harvesting of marine resources."" In 1992, Norway joined with Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands to form the The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission as an alternative to the IWC. The Commission describes itself as ""an international regional body for cooperation on the conservation, management and study of marine mammals in the North Atlantic."" ""It really is counter-logical to me why they are clinging so strongly to this industry when it doesn't make sense economically,"" adds Ms. O'Connell. ""You think 'Oh whales, how important can they be in terms of geo-politics?' But IWC is a highly political venue.""  Above all, Norwegians say their whaling practice is necessary to protect local fish stocks. Whales are consuming too much fish, say proponents, and they need to be ""culled"" to ensure health fish populations. But scientists, including some Norwegian researchers, disagree, arguing instead that whales are a crucial aspect of underwater ecosystems. This is a surprisingly disingenuous argument, some experts say, considering Norway's reputation as an environmental leader. ""Norway continues to give the impression that its whaling is sustainable,"" write the authors of AWI's Frozen in Time report. ""However, by arbitrarily lowering the precautionary tuning level set by the IWC, by allowing open hunts rather than setting quotas by small area, and by making whales the scapegoat for collapsing fish stocks, Norway has called its scientific integrity into question."" When asked about next steps forward, both O'Connell and Fuchs say education is key.  ""Norway is a very rich country, you can't threaten them with sanctions,"" says Fuchs. ""You have to focus on the electorate because if they start to question their government and realize whale-watching is an additional revenue, this will bring a solution along with diplomatic actions from other countries."" When Japanese citizens learned about their government's subsidies for the whaling industry, public disapproval of the practice rose. This would likely be the same case in Norway, says O'Connell. Citizens are also typically unaware of whale-watching's substantial revenue stream, as proven by the recent boost to Iceland's tourism economy. ""They are clinging to this past notion of what Norway was in history,"" O'Connell argues, ""rather than recognizing what Norway could be in the future."""
How Brexit will affect British tourists travelling to Europe,Norway,"Travel expert Simon Calder explains how Britain leaving the European Union will affect travel It's no secret that Londoners love to holiday. Come summer, thousands of us jet off to sunnier climes around Europe, whether it be a beach break to the French Riviera or a city stay in Barcelona. But how will travel to Europe be affected by the result of the EU referendum on Thursday June 24? Will Brexit make it be more expensive? Will we need visas? Will roaming charges increase? Here, travel expert Simon Calder answers the questions on your mind. Will holidays cost more? In the short term, the slide in sterling to its lowest level for year means the price of everything from a cup of coffee in a cafe in Paris to a night in a luxury hotel in the Maldives will rise. UK votes to leave EU but London votes Remain The level of the increase depends on what level the pound settles at: before the referendum, the Treasury predicted sterling would lose 12-15 per cent of its value on a Leave vote. Longer term, the two key rates are against the euro and the dollar. Read more EU referendum: What happens next? The €:£ rate is crucial because we take the majority of our foreign holidays to the single-currency area: to the Spanish costas, the French countryside, the cities of Italy and the islands of Greece. Even if you never venture beyond Europe, the $:£ rate is also significant. Oil is priced in dollars, as are aircraft. So a 12 per cent fall in sterling will push up the price of petrol, diesel and aviation fuel, as well as the cost of aircraft for airlines such as British Airways and easyJet. Will I be asked to pay more for my holiday this year - or next? Abta, the travel association, allows holiday companies to impose surcharges “when the cost of a package holiday goes up after you booked because of currency fluctuations (the euro growing stronger against the pound, for instance) [and] rising fuel costs (for flights and cruises)”. The firm must absorb the first 2 per cent of any increase, and if the surcharge goes above 10 per cent then you have the right to cancel. If you have already paid for your holiday in full, it is unlikely that you will need to pay a surcharge. The company will probably have hedged its currency requirements for paying airlines and hoteliers. Some firms will also have hedged, at least partially, costs for 2017 holidays. Anyone who has put together their own trip, and has yet to pay for accommodation or a rental car, will find that the cost in sterling terms has risen. Will cheap flights disappear? “Open skies” represents one of the most tangible benefits of European Union membership. Since 1994, any EU airline has been free to fly between any two points in Europe. The freedom to fly allowed easyJet and Ryanair to flourish, and has forced “legacy” carriers such as BA, Air France and Lufthansa to cut costs and fares. On any European journey you care to name, the typical fare is around half what it was in the early 1990s - and anyone who can be flexible about timing can save even more. David Cameron resigns following EU referendum result Before the referendum, some in the Remain camp speculated that open skies would be among the first arrangements to be binned. If the UK negotiates a similar arrangement to Norway, within the European Economic Area (EEA), then little would change; Norwegian, a non-EU budget airline, flies successfully within Europe and from the UK to the US. If Britain does not join the EEA. every route between the UK and the EU might need to be renegotiated on a bilateral basis. The bureaucratic logjam would be immense. Similarly, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have easy access to America because of an EU-US treaty on open skies. But given that London is the world hub of aviation, and a key destination for dozens of airlines, it looks unlikely that routes to and from the UK will be affected. The freedom for British airlines such as easyJet to fly within and between EU countries could be curtailed; nations such as France and Italy have in the past been protectionist of their home airlines. The chance to clip the wings of the likes of easyJet could be welcomed by politicians and airlines in other EU countries - if not by travellers. It is likely that airlines will restructure into separate UK- and EU-based corporate entities, adding complexity and cost, and reducing flexibility. Immediately after the result, Carolyn McCall, easyJet's chief executive, said she had written to the UK government and European Commission urging them ""to prioritise the UK remaining part of the single EU aviation market"". How will passengers’ rights be affected? The EU stipulates care and compensation in the event of disruption for airline passengers (and, to a limited extent, international train and ferry travellers). These automatic rights would end for UK airlines when flying from British aorports, though EU airlines (including Ryanair) would continue to be governed by them. It is possible that a future British government would create its own rules on passenger rights. Could using our phones abroad cost more? Another tangible benefit for EU consumers has been the squeeze on the excessive roaming charges levied by mobile phone companies. The maximum surcharges phone firms can add for calls, texts and data while abroad have just been reduced again. By next June they will disappear completely; that will happen despite the vote to leave. Once Britain leaves, it is difficult to imagine any UK government saying to the mobile-phone firms: “As we’re out of the EU now, feel free to bring back excessive roaming charges.” Read more EU referendum: No immediate change to free movement laws after Brexit, says Cameron Brexit: five ways leaving the EU will impact London's property market Brexit panic on the trading floor: Diary of how the drama unfolded at ETX David Cameron resigns as Prime Minister while FTSE plunges after Britain backs Brexit in EU referendum In addition, mobile-phone companies will start demonstrating a year from now that they can survive on zero roaming fees within Europe, and it may be that competitive pressure is sufficient to keep a lid on price rises. What about British people who live in other EU countries? The immediate impact for those who depend on savings or pensions in sterling is that the cost of living will rise; the exact amount depends on how the local currency strengthens against the pound. Longer term, the automatic right to live and work in EU countries will end, but it is likely that long-term expatriates will be able to stay. UK passports and driving licences are “EU-branded”. Will we need to get new ones? No, and for the time being new UK driving licences will continue to show the EU symbol and British passports will bear words “European Union” on the cover. But within a few years, when you renew either your passport or driving licence the design will change. Some say we’ll need visas to go to Europe? Yes, during the campaign some elements of the Remain side hinted darkly that we’ll all be queuing up outside the Spanish Embassy before we’re allowed to go to Benidorm. Michael Gove on Cameron and Brexit The Green MP Caroline Lucas said that, in the event of the UK leaving the Single Market, “We would need to have visas.” Yet the UK is second only to Germany in terms of the tourists it exports to other countries. Britain runs a massive “tourism deficit” (the excess of what we spend abroad compared with what we earn from foreign tourists), much to the benefit of bartenders from Benidorm to Benitses. The suggestion that the governments of Spain, Greece, Portugal, etc would single out Brits for tougher treatment at the border is far-fetched. We will simply continue to show our passports on arrival, as we do now - as the UK is outside the Schengen Area. Will there be border controls on the land frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic? Unlikely. There has been largely unrestricted travel between the two countries since 1921 under the terms of a Common Travel Area (which also includes the Isle of Man). The government says: ""A person who has been examined for the purpose of immigration control at the point at which he entered the area does not normally require leave to enter any other part of it."" The Republic of Ireland will probably remain outside Schengen, and the current absence of frontier posts will probably continue. Popular European destination: Santorini (Rex) We’re told always to travel to Europe with our EHICs. Presumably health care will get more expensive and travel insurance costs will rise? European Health Insurance Cards indicate entitlement to public health care on the same basis as local people in EU countries. But before joining the EEC (as was), the UK had reciprocal health agreements with many European nations. We still maintain bilateral deals with 16 countries, such as Australia, New Zealand and the former Yugoslavian republics of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. It is likely that a similar range of deals would be concluded with some or all EU members. If they are not, then the need for travel insurance will increase - and premiums could rise. What about duty-free? When the UK leaves, it is likely that the limits that apply elsewhere in the world will be re-imposed. For alcohol, that means one litre of spirits, four litres of wine and 16 litres of beer - so no more filling up the boot with cheap claret in Calais. The tobacco limit will be 200 cigarettes. Those limits are irrespective of In addition, a limit of “other goods” of £390 will be imposed. A silver lining for airlines and cross-Channel ferry operators is that proper duty free would return; anyone who currently promises “duty free” for a journey within the EU is fibbing. Looking at the UK tourist industry, the slump in sterling is presumablya benefit? With weaker sterling, the rest of the world will get more pounds for its euros, dollars, yen, etc, making the UK a cheaper destination to visit. Conversely, going abroad becomes more expensive for the British traveller, who may then choose to holiday in Cornwall rather than the Costa del Sol. But it’s more complicated than that, especially in terms of British holidaymakers’ behaviour. Demand for overseas travel is price-inelastic. If people find foreign holidays significantly more expensive, some may opt to stay in the UK. But between the summers of 2008 and 2009, when the cost of going abroad increased by roughly 25 per cent, the number of overseas trips by British holidaymakers reduced by a much smaller percentage. Looking at foreign visitors coming here: EU rules allow European citizens to come to Britain with only a national identity card. The UK government could re-impose the rule that all foreign nationals must have a passport, though the British travel industry would lobby strongly against anything that makes it more difficult for many EU citizens to visit the UK.

Cameron's early exit gives Boris advantage as next PM,Norway,"News Boris Johnson could become Prime Minister in just nine weeks’ time after Conservative MPs called for David Cameron to be gone and a new leader in place by September. As MPs returned to Westminster for the first time since the historic Brexit vote, the party’s influential 1922 committee said a new Conservative leader should be in place by 2 September, with nominations set to open tomorrow. Announcing his resignation last week, Mr Cameron had said a new Prime Minister should be appointed to negotiate the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU by October. But the shorter timescale, which must be approved by the party’s board today, will favour Mr Johnson, the frontrunner in the race, allowing him to harness the momentum from Leave’s referendum victory to garner support among the 125,000 Conservative members who will elect the next leader, and the next PM. Addressing MPs in the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron said there could be “no doubt about the result” of the referendum but warned of difficult days ahead. A special Whitehall “Brexit unit” will be set up to explore the options facing Britain in its new relationship with the EU, he said, admitting that it would be “the most complex and most important task the British civil service has undertaken in decades”. However, all key decisions will wait until the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Mr Cameron said. Mr Johnson, who was not in the House of Commons chamber yesterday, is considered the frontrunner to replace Mr Cameron and is expected to announce his candidacy this week. The new leader will come under immediate pressure to call a general election. The former Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, said it would be wrong that only members of the Conservative Party should be able to appoint the new Prime Minister “of a new government, with new priorities” and called for an early general election this year. Mr Cameron, who will remain as an MP after standing down, will remain neutral during the Conservative leadership contest, Downing Street confirmed. He told MPs it would be for the next Prime Minister to determine whether a general election is called this year. It will also be up to the new Prime Minister to activate Article 50 – the formal procedure by which member states can leave the EU – and to negotiate the terms of Britain’s new relationship with the bloc. The key battle-line will centre on Britain’s access to the European single market. Mr Cameron told MPs that it would be “one of the single most important decisions” for the Government, emphasising the single market’s importance for the economy and jobs market. Mr Johnson has claimed the UK could still have access to the single market – but to do so would entail adopting a relationship with the EU similar to Norway’s, and still being bound by freedom of movement rules. After the Leave campaign led by Mr Johnson fought the referendum campaign on a promise to cut immigration, staying in the single market at this cost would be seen as a betrayal of Brexit voters. Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative Brexit campaigner who has said she is considering a leadership bid, has said blocking freedom of movement should be a red line in the EU negotiations. “The decision we’re going to have to take, and it will be for the next Government, about how we get the best possible access to the single market, I think will be one of the single most important decisions that the Government must take on,” Mr Cameron said. “Because we must bear in mind the importance of safeguarding our economy, its trade links and its jobs.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi yesterday insisted that there could be no formal or informal talks about Britain’s new relationship with the EU until the Article 50 had been activated. Mr Cameron will meet fellow EU leaders for talks in Brussels today. Mr Cameron also used yesterday’s Commons statement to condemn the rise in anti-migrant incidents reported since the Brexit vote, including an incident of racist graffiti daubed on a Polish community centre. A Downing Street spokesperson said that many MPs had received reports from their constituencies and communities of migrants being intimidated or “told they need to go home”. “We are absolutely clear and we need to reassure communities across Britain…this Government will not tolerate intolerance,” the spokesperson said. Saying that Britain was a tolerant, inclusive nation, the spokesperson added: “Those views and that value of our nation existed long before we were members of the EU and we should hold fast to that value and stand up for that value in the days and weeks ahead.” Downing Street has also ruled out a second EU referendum, saying it was “not remotely on the cards”, and said that a second Scottish independence referendum was “the last thing Scotland needs” after the Scottish government insisted they would not allow the country to be taken out of the EU. Cameron heads for an uncomfortable final appearance at Brussels summit By Charlie Cooper, Whitehall Correspondent David Cameron will travel to Brussels today for what will in all likelihood be deeply uncomfortable talks with EU leaders, in his final scheduled meeting with the full European Council before he stands down as Prime Minister. The meeting of the Council, made up of the leaders of the EU’s 28 member states, which was moved to allow the UK’s EU referendum to take place, will now be dominated by the fallout from Britain’s shock vote to leave the bloc. Tomorrow, the 27 other leaders will meet without Mr Cameron to discuss the implications of Brexit for the EU. Government sources insisted Mr Cameron had built “strong relations” with his fellow EU leaders over the years and would use the summit to try and encourage a “constructive spirit” for the coming negotiations over Britain’s new relationship with the EU. However, senior EU leaders have made it clear there can be no talks – not even on an informal basis – on Britain’s status until the government invokes Article 50, the formal procedure for leaving the EU. Mr Cameron has said it will be for his successor, who is likely to be in place by September, to do this – leaving Britain and the EU in two months of limbo. But until Britain formally quits, the country continues to be a full member of the EU, with the same rights as other nations, and to “have a seat at the table”, government sources insisted. Today’s session will be Mr Cameron’s final appearance at a Brussels summit, as the next is not scheduled to take place until October, however, he will meet EU leaders at an event in France this week commemorating the centenary of the Battle of the Somme and at a Nato summit next month in Warsaw. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Sajid Javid will meet more than 20 representatives of UK business today to discuss the “significant challenges” ahead. Senior figures from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Institute of Directors (IoD) and representatives of the aerospace, defence, car, oil and gas, steel, rail, tourism and food industries will attend the meeting, at which Mr Javid is expected to say that while the economic risks of Brexit are great, there will also be ‘opportunities’ for business. “There are significant challenges ahead, but the economic success of the past few years means we’re better able to withstand the current market turbulence and work towards a better future,” Mr Javid said. “The UK remains open for business."
Brexit fallout: Here are the winners and losers from a weaker pound,Norway,"The pound has plummeted to its lowest level in more than three decades against the dollar[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/06/27/george-osborne-to-speak-in-attempt-to-calm-markets-following-bre/] in the wake of the Brexit vote. Here's why it happened and whether households and businesses should be braced for further falls. Why has the pound fallen? The value of the pound is influenced by a number of factors, including growth, interest rates and inflation. Strong economies have strong currencies because investors want to put their cash into countries where growth prospects are strong. They need local currency to do this, and the increase in demand for sterling pushes up its value. That's why when there's good economic news, such as robust GDP figures or strong jobs growth, the value of the pound rises. What leaving the EU means for your personal financesPlay!01:19Investors believe Britain's decision to leave the EU[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/eu-referendum-labour-crisis-jeremy-corbyn-vows-to-fight-on-after/] has reduced the country's growth prospects. This has triggered a sell-off in sterling. In the coming weeks and months, foreign investors may also become more nervous about buying and holding UK assets. The UK is reliant on foreign money - around £100bn a year to be exact - to finance its huge current account deficit[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/21/why-the-uks-current-account-deficit-has-economists-spooked/], which measures the difference between money flowing in and out of the country. The pound is vulnerable to further falls if investors suddenly pull their cash out of the UK. why the Norway option could take the risk out of Brexit[https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/07b5b62a-a7be-4332-b1f2-4d9983cb3e71.html]Central bank interest rates also matter: higher rates attract overseas capital looking for better returns. At the start of this year, financial markets believed that the UK would raise interest rates this August. This helped to lift the value of the pound against a basket of other currencies. The Brexit vote means traders are predicting lower growth - and interest rates - for much longer. The result? Markets have fully priced in a rate cut by the end of this year. Rates aren't expected to rise again until November... November 2020, that is. What does it mean for households and businesses?For Britons planning their summer holidays, it's bad news. A weaker pound means consumers will get less bang for their buck overseas. A family changing £1,000 into dollars would have received up to $1,501 last week. Today, £1,000 buys just $1,318. A weaker pound also means UK businesses have to pay more for goods they buy in foreign currencies, making imports more expensive. These higher costs could fuel domestic inflation. Economists at HSBC believe consumer inflation will jump to 4pc next year - which is double the Bank of England's 2pc target. How leaving the EU could affect travellersPlay!01:09A weaker pound is also likely to push up petrol prices because oil is traded in dollars and Britain is a net importer. Last week, the AA said prices were likely to rise by around £1.25 a tank if sterling remained around the current level ""over the next 10 to 14 days"". If the pound falls further, prices at the pumps are likely to rise even more. For exporters, the news is brighter. A weaker pound makes their goods more competitive, boosting growth. Manufacturers have complained in recent years that the strong pound has hurt trade. The weakness in the run-up to the vote has helped British factories to weather uncertainty. However, Britain doesn't sell as many things overseas as it once did. The massive depreciation of sterling seen in the wake of the financial crisis did not eliminate Britain's trade deficit. A weaker pound may also boost the economy through tourism, as travellers flock to Britain to spend their dollars and euros. How will policymakers react?Everything is relative. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, attempted to calm markets on Friday, insisting that policymakers ""will not hesitate"" to act if needed. The Bank is ready to flood the markets with cash on Tuesday via an auction of long-term loans to prevent investor panic. The auction is the last of three special operations conducted around the referendum. How the world reacted to BrexitPlay!02:26Banks snapped up £2.46bn in extra liquidity in the first auction. The second, held just two days before the vote, saw demand fall to £370m. It is likely to be higher this time. Maintaining financial stability is key. The Bank's Financial Stability report on July 5 will offer the first insight into the thinking on Threadneedle Street. Most economists also expect the Bank to cut interest rates in the coming months. This could weaken the pound further, and potentially stoke inflation, but may be needed to boost flagging growth. ""In the coming weeks, the Bank will assess economic conditions and will consider any additional policy responses,"" said Mr Carney. In any case, policymakers will be watching closely to see if a weaker pound feeds into weaker sentiment and spending decisions. Will the pound fall further?Experts think so. Deutsche Bank believes the pound will fall to $1.15 against the dollar by the end of this year, and €1.10 against the euro, from $1.32 and €1.20 today. However, analysts noted that ""a delay to triggering Article 50"", which is the formal notification to leave the EU, would help to prop up sterling. Credit Suisse said invoking Article 50 would signal ""full Brexit"", which would push the pound down below $1.30 against the dollar.

Your guide to booking a post-Brexit holiday,Norway,"The main short-term impact of the Brexit vote on travellers so far is the fall in the value of sterling. This has been very sharp, but, it seems to have stabilised at about €1.20 to the pound. That is a lot lower than recent performance – the rate was over 1.35 at Christmas. But it is still higher than it was in the depths of the last recession between 2008-2012. So don’t be too pessimistic. Costs on the ground in most destinations have effectively gone up by 10 per cent – not great, but not a complete disaster. We have seen this situation before, and it is still possible the euro may also weaken because of the political uncertainties on the Continent, too. Read more: what Brexit could mean for travellers[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/what-would-brexit-mean-for-travellers/] A bigger issue from a cost point of view is the value of the pound against the US dollar, which at one point this week slumped to its lowest level since 1985. It has recovered some ground, though it remains weak. The problem here is not just for travellers who are planning to travel to the United States. Many countries – especially in the Caribbean – have currencies which are pegged to the US dollar or which use it as a parallel currency. Many travel services – like cruises or luxury safari lodges – are priced in US dollars. And, most importantly of all, so is oil, and this will put pressure on airfares, ferry fares and petrol price. How leaving the EU could affect travellersPlay!01:09How soon will we feel the impact? Much depends on the performance of the pound. But some prices will be affected sooner than others. Obviously costs when you arrive in a destination, and anything you have booked in advance which was priced in a foreign currency, have already gone up. But, in the short term, the cost of anything you have booked or can book in sterling will be protected. So, what can you do now to make the best of the situation, and, looking further ahead, what are the longer-term implications for travellers. Short-term strategiesThe pound has dropped against virtually all currencies since the vote. But according the FairFX[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/lists/destinations-where-the-pound-goes-further/], those where it is still higher than it was three years ago include: Norway[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/norway/articles/norway-travel-guide/] (up 22 per cent) and Sweden[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/sweden/articles/sweden-travel-guide/] (11 per cent); Australia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/oceania/australia/articles/australia-travelguide/] and Canada[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/canada/] (nine per cent) and Croatia[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/croatia/articles/croatia-summer-holidaysguide/] (four per cent). While staying in the UK for your holiday means you are protected from currency fluctuations, remember that many other people will be thinking the same. This summer, at least, there will probably be fewer good deals, and less availability than usual. By contrast, you are much more likely to get a good-value late deal on a holiday in Europe. Package holidays priced in pounds are a particularly good option and the best place to find them is to look out for offers on tour operator websites. See our holiday bookings guides at telegraph.co.uk/tt-bookingguides[http://telegraph.co.uk/tt-bookingguides] for detailed guides and contacts for operators to all the key Mediterranean destinations. Note, however, tour operators are legally allowed to surcharge, or increase the price of your holiday by up to 10 per cent even after you have booked if their costs increase because of factors such as currency fluctuations. Strict rules are in place: the provision for surcharging has to be stated in the booking conditions, no price increases can be imposed within 30 days of departure, and the operator has to absorb the first two per cent of any cost increases. You must be allowed a cancel option and be given a full refund if you don’t want to pay the extra. Many big tour operators hedge their costs to avoid the need to surcharge. Inghams has just announced that it has frozen all its summer and winter holiday prices and ruled out surcharges. Abta lists all its members which are imposing surcharges on its website ( abta.com[http://abta.com] ) – currently there are only two listed. .html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}Rules over flight delays may be watered down in futureAnd don’t forget that even with the weaker pound, hotel prices, the cost of renting holiday cottages, and of eating out are still significantly cheaper in most European countries than they are here. A holiday in northern France, for example, can still be better value than the equivalent in Cornwall or Devon. Consider all-inclusive holidays priced in sterling. That is the easiest way to protect the bulk of your holiday costs. Don’t gamble on currency. You stand as much chance of losing as of winning. Buy it when you need it. Using your credit card as much as possible is probably the most cost-efficient way of paying – as long as you pay off the balance each month. Looking further aheadIn terms of passports, border controls, citizenship and freedom of movement, nothing will change until we are formally detached from the EU – which is unlikely to happen until at least autumn 2018. The biggest risks to travellers after that are the potential erosion of consumer rights which have emerged from EU directives, regulations and other arrangements. These protections may be particularly vulnerable because they are unlikely to be at the top of the agenda given the many pressing concerns which will have to be dealt with. Perhaps the most crucial benefit of EU membership is our right to a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) which entitles UK citizens to free or reduced-cost treatment in other EU countries. It may survive, or we may find that countries like Spain, which has to fund a very high number of British residents there, oppose its continuation. At a glance | What Brexit would mean for… my European Health Insurance Card[https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/f962d02c-d8c7-4f0f-a38b-2faeb90643f9.html]Read more: how the UK tourism industry intends to weather the Brexit storm[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/articles/how-brexit-might-affect-the-uk-tourism-industry/] EU rules on compensation for airline delays and cancellations[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/Travel-compensation-advice/] are very generous towards passengers. Too generous I have argued in the past – you can get hundreds of pounds in compensation for three hours’ delay to a flight, even if the fare only cost you £20 in the first place. All flights in and out of the EU and on EU airlines, such as Ryanair, will still be covered automatically by the regulations, but there is a high chance this is one area of protection which will be watered down. What is most important is that passengers suffering overnight delays retain their rights to be properly looked after in a hotel. How the pound has fared in popular holiday destinations[https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/9ceb1df0-e563-4d47-bf38-c36cd2dd17c9.html]Mobile roaming charges within the EU are due to be abolished entirely in 2017. We will still be members then, so presumably it will still happen and we should benefit for at least a year. But will it survive post 2018? I’m not confident. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the package travel regulations which protect your money in case your travel company goes out of business before you travel or if it happens while you are away ensure that you get home safely, stem from an EU directive. There is a lot of opposition in the travel industry because they add significantly to costs. A government keen to help may well be tempted to water them down.

CHEAPER THRILLS IN STAVANGER,Norway,"[STANDFIRST] A drop in crude prices has made Norway's oil capital Stavanger a more affordable city break option. Stephanie Maskery goes in search of fantastic food, fjords and fun Gathered around the chef's table, our party of eight eagerly anticipates the arrival of our 17-course sushi dinner. Each dish is a tiny work of art, and we all mumble appreciative 'aahs' as we taste freshly caught salmon and cod, with wasabi. Roger Joya, who came fourth at the sushi world championships in 2015, is our chef for the evening at Sabi Omakase, an intimate restaurant with room for just nine people. While it may sound like the finest Japan has to offer, I'm actually more than 5,000 miles from Tokyo, in Norway's oil capital, Stavanger. Since the discovery of oil in the late 1960s, Stavanger has been the poster boy for Norway's economic boom. Many of the city's 130,000 inhabitants enjoyed a life of high wages, low unemployment and an extremely luxurious restaurant scene. But the price of oil has been dropping, reaching a 12-year low earlier this year. Norway's economy has taken a hard hit, and the impact has been most notably felt in Stavanger, where a weaker krone means it's now a much more affordable destination. Central hotels cost from just £62 per night, and flights from across the UK start from as little as £44 one way. Fortunately, there's much more than oil to a city where brightly-painted wooden buildings line a harbour looking out towards cloud-shrouded fjords across the bay. We're eating dinner in Storhaug, one of Stavanger's newest up-and-coming suburbs. Formally known as the city's backyard, the area is an eclectic mix of second-hand bookshops, street markets and start-ups from young, hip entrepreneurs. You can grab a coffee in the new, trendy indoor food market Mathallen, or try some delicious tarragon-roasted langoustines in Ostehuset, a cafe-come-deli celebrating local produce. Just a short walk away is Olbaren Ost, a tiny bar situated on the site of a former brewery, where everything from the furniture to the beer is handcrafted. Keen to keep it cool, the next day we sign up to the NuArt tour (£13 per person), a 90-minute city centre guided walk that takes in works of the NuArt Festival, a celebration of the world's leading street art. Our guide, Mike Wojtowics, points out 50ft wall murals of whales, stencil art of angels and even tiny toy men fixed to walls and hidden around the city. The festival, which has been running every September for the past 15 years, attracts world-class graffiti artists including Pure Evil, famous for his images of crying celebrities. While some of the artwork is temporary, a lot of it is permanent, meaning Stavanger has some of the best and most diverse street art in the world. For those seeking more traditional pursuits, there are several quirky museums. The sleek and rather spectacular Petroleum Museum tells the story of Norway's discovery of oil, with fascinating interactive displays and a mock drill platform, complete with emergency chute. We also visit The Norwegian Canning Museum and take a guided tour of what life was like before the oil, when Stavanger's main industry was canning. ""If it swam in the sea or grew on trees, we canned it,"" our enthusiastic English guide Piers informs us. While Stavanger's quirky attractions make for a fun day out, most tourists know the city as a gateway to the fjords and despite looming black clouds, we are keen to get out onto the water with a cruise up to the famous Pulpit Rock, Norway's most photographed monument. Heavy mist sits on top of the Lysefjord's mountainous cliffs, but the place is still stunning. We speed past craggy islands dotted with red-roofed houses, churning up the strikingly blue waters of the fjord. As we approach the famous Pulpit, a sheer jut of granite towering 604m above the fjord, we see... nothing. Hidden above the clouds, we're just going to have to climb it instead. Tours of the Lysefjord leave from Stavanger several times daily and you can opt for just the cruise (£37 each) or the cruise and the hike, which as a round trip, takes six hours and costs £70. Tickets can easily be bought on the day either at the quay, on board or from the tourist information. ""The weather is trolsk,"" says our guide, ""it means the trolls are nearby"". As we head up into the mist, it's easy to see why legends around here are plentiful. After two hours, we finally get our glimpse of the rock. It's a gigantic structure, reaching out into the abyss, like an altar to the Norse gods. It's said to be one of the greatest viewing platforms on earth. Sadly, there's no view right now, but who needs one? It's still breathtaking. As people precariously dangle their legs over the edge, perhaps it's good we can't see to the bottom. The epic climb to the top of the rock leaves us feeling rather adventurous, so what better way to recharge the adrenalin than a sea safari on a power rib? Fjord Events offers a range of raft excursions (£70 each for two hours) where you can look out for whales, seals and birds of prey, all while bouncing over the waves at up to 60mph. We head to Flor and Fjaere, also known as the palm island - a unique oasis in the North Sea. As we disembark onto the small jetty, we're immediately greeted with an explosion of colour. Some 50,000 annuals are planted by hand every year to stun visitors and the scent of all these flowers permeates the whole island. Our guide and co-owner of the island, Siri, takes us on a tour of the gardens - a passion project started by her father-in-law and expanded by her husband into a 20-acre site with beaches, waterfalls and even a Japanese carp pond. You could easily lose yourself in the beauty here, but our captain, Havard Gundersen, is calling us back to the rib. At well over 6ft tall and sporting a gigantic ginger beard, his infectious grin has us all excitedly clambering aboard. Soon we're speeding over the water, while the wind whips at our faces. We've all caught the Norwegian passion for life - great food, great culture and great fun. Approaching Stavanger, we pass the royal yacht. The king and queen are here today and I'm reminded of the wealth in this tiny and charming town. Nipping past on our speedy boat, I realise how fun it is too, with much more to offer visitors than just its oil. TRAVEL FACTS :: Stephanie Maskery was a guest of the Norwegian Tourist Board.

Is 'rig-spotting' in the North Sea cruising's next big trend?,Norway,"It’s infamous for its storms, its rough seas and its oil – but the North Sea is proving an unlikely hit among holidaymakers who signed up for the world’s first ‘rig-spotting’ tour. You won’t find any white-sand beaches or cocktails on the itinerary: the North Sea’s gigantic oil platforms are the main draw on this off-beat cruise. “It's just wonderful, just wonderful,” 86-year-old cruiser Kari Somme told Reuters after the inaugural four-day voyage. “I was so excited because I didn't know much about it. So when I came here and we went from rig to rig, or platform to platform, I was amazed.” The 120-strong group of Norwegian, German and Swedish tourists set sail from Haugesund in Norway last week, paying between 6,000 NOK (£535) and 30,000 NOK (£2,674) for the all-inclusive trip. ""Never before have regular passengers been given the opportunity to live onboard such a vessel and [have] firsthand experience of how offshore workers live and work""Credit: Edda Accommodation The idea was dreamed up by Edda Accommodation, which owns a fleet of 'accommodation vessels' for off-shore oil workers. Perhaps inspired by the value of oil dropping 60 per cent since 2014, the company launched Edda Adventures: an “opportunity to experience the giants of the North Sea up close,” according to its website. “Never before have regular passengers been given the opportunity to live onboard such a vessel and [have] firsthand experience of how offshore workers live and work,” it claims. Europe's most adventurous cruise destinations[https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/076e67ab-362b-4e7c-9e9d-d56d675b6343.html]“We used our creativity to come up with ideas. We organised this trip in six weeks,” Bjoern Erik Julseth, the hotel manager on board, told Reuters. The group travelled on board Edda Fides, a state-of-the-art North Sea vessel which is designed to withstand challenging conditions, and is usually used to accommodate 600 crew. * 10 journeys to the ends of the Earth[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activity-and-adventure/journeys-to-the-ends-of-the-earth/] * The 10 best places in Europe to spot whales[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/articles/whale-watching-in-europe-the-best-destinations/] The itinerary included tours of the Balder and Ringhorn oil fields – which produce thousands of barrels of oil per day – as well as Statoil's Troll A rig, which looms 200 metres above sea level and is the heaviest structure ever moved by mankind. ""Edda Fides is a state-of-the-art vessel, designed to accommodate 600 oil crew""Credit: Edda Accommodation There was a musical theme to the tour, too, as excursions included the Edvard Grieg oil field – which is named after the Norwegian composer and pianist – and Moldejazz festival in the coastal town of Molde. Passenger Nils Olav Nergaard described the experience as “a real adventure. To be a part of a high-tech offshore vessel, almost as a crew, and get the experience to go to the oil platforms and see them for real, that was very amazing.” * How to travel around the world by cruise ship[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/how-to-travel-around-the-world-by-cruise-ship/] While security and safety rules prevented the passengers from boarding the rigs, they enjoyed a warm reception from the offshore workers. “Some of them fired flares or used water canons to welcome us,” said Julseth. “We even had a rescue helicopter, with one worker dangling above us.” Survive fall from cruise ship[https://cf-particle-html.eip.telegraph.co.uk/c08ffc59-e93f-4f04-84a2-3a1827d64e31.html]Edda Accommodation is considering organising another voyage – and its website invites bookings, although no dates have been revealed.

Pack for the future,Norway,"Europe reimagined in Dubai, hotels beneath the sea, journeys into space and cars that can fly - the world of travel is about to get a lot more exciting, says John O'Ceallaigh Though we are in tumultuous times, post-Brexit, nobody has yet confronted the prospect of an enclave of Britain adopting the euro - but it is going to happen, and shortly. For an Austrian developer is set to make this unlikely eventuality a reality; and to understand the supposedly impossible, we need to venture somewhere that specialises in creating what has previously been inconceivable: Dubai. There, back in 2003, a state-owned construction company began a project that would see an archipelago of 300 man-made islands emerge three miles offDubai's coast. Known as The World, and measuring four miles across, they now form a vast map of Earth if viewed from above. Plans to build on The World stalled when the emirate's financial crisis struck, but six islands are now being turned into what Austrian developer Josef Kleindienst expects to become the world's most exciting holiday destination - a six million sq ft development known as The Heart of Europe (thoe.com). Named Main Europe, Germany, Monaco, Sweden, Switzerland and St Petersburg (""Russia"" already exists elsewhere in The World), these islands will feature a range of hotels and leisure amenities, all representing a European country in some way. Islands named after specific destinations will be inspired by those regions: Germany will offer Christmas markets, an Oktoberfest, and specialities from Apfelstrudel to Jägermeister; in Switzerland expect fresh snow produced by an artificialsnow maker, similar to the one used in the Mall of the Emirates indoor ski centre. Main Europe will be a repository for the destinations without a designated island, so visitors will be able to explore ""the rest of Europe"" - 51 countries in total - by, say, frequenting an Irish pub or sampling French patisserie. How Britain will be represented is unconfirmed but, as with everywhere else, staffwill be from the relevant destination - and the official currency will be the euro. It was the blank canvas left by the stalling of The World that inspired Kleindienst to create a single destination offering ""the best of what Europe has to offer… assembled in a new way. Most people want to travel and experience the world but not many can do it, so visiting The World [and The Heart of Europe] in Dubai is the next best option."" He expects the project to be finished by 2018, and although my recent visit suggested there was still much to do, stays in the islands' Floating Seahorse holiday homes (see cover image) will be possible from the end of 2016. In total, 131 of these three-storey ""boats without propulsion"" will surround The Heart of Europe. The glass-bottomed Jacuzzis on the rooftop are novel but the most impressive feature awaits below sea level. There, the glass wall of the master bedroom faces a coral garden intended to entice passing sea life. The surrounding area is not yet a diver's paradise but I did see shoals of silver fish emerge from the murky twilight. Guests paying £2,100 per night will have access to the surrounding beaches and restaurants; 90 of the units will encircle the heart-shaped St Petersburg to form a Maldives-style honeymoon resort with infinity pool and spa. Savvy use of nascent technologies has proved pivotal to the viability of The Heart of Europe, and other innovations will radically change the idea of where, how and why we travel in future. The World Travel & Tourism Council calculates that in 2015 tourism generated $7.2 trillion (9.8 per cent of global GDP) and estimates that this figure will rise to $8.7 trillion in 2020 and $11 trillion in 2026. With such predictions, rich spoils await the creators of the tourism products we will adopt in years to come. Lola Pedro, a regional director with trend-forecasting agency TrendWatching, predicts that increasingly personalised digital platforms will drastically alter the holidays we take over the next decade. ""Expect to see a shift from today's mass-market, internet-driven holiday curation to newer technologies that express a more personalised understanding of a holidaymaker's personality, interests, and emotional and social needs,"" she says. Websites such as Airbnb and instant-dating app Tinder already encourage consumers to trust strangers - and we should expect ""more liquid social connections and travel services that immediately match [travellers] with others at their destinations who have shared interests"". How rapidly new behaviours can develop is ably demonstrated by the current Pokémon Go phenomenon, a smartphone app launched last month that uses augmented reality (overlaying computergenerated elements on a user's real surroundings) to insert Pokémon characters into a player's world. Within a week of its arrival it was generating an estimated revenue of $1.6million per day in the United States and has seen users traverse cities and countries in their efforts to encounter each character. Other augmented-reality apps, encouraging us to rediscover electronically the settings we encounter in reality, are certain to follow shortly. Expect virtual-reality travel experiences to become more popular, too. Increasingly sophisticated headsets are already enabling the immobile to admire the view from Machu Picchu, for example, and also allowing discerning consumers to ""try before they fly"". Thomas Cook is harnessing the technology to offer customers tantalising taster experiences, such as helicopter rides above Manhattan and tours of the pyramids. The Australian airline Qantas, meanwhile, has provided headsets preloaded with immersive travel guides to some premium passengers. Affordable headsets are being launched by PlayStation, HTC and Oculus VR (owned by Facebook), so virtual excursions could soon be a reality for many. Other wearable tech may further alter how we travel. Though the future of Google Glass is uncertain, more discreet types of apparatus are on the way. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology is developing microscopic circuits so small they can be embedded in a contact lens. Apple Watch offers travel-ready apps that provide instant currency conversions and flight information, while easyJet's Sneakairs prototype uses trainers embedded with vibrating smartphone-synchronised sensors to indicate when notable landmarks are within immediate reach of sightseers. The things we choose to see are changing, too: the world's first ""rigspotting"" tour last month saw a group of 120 tourists pay from £535 per head to participate in a four-day tour of North Sea oil rigs. From September, guests at Cape Town's Ellerman House hotel will be able to fly by private jet to the jewel-rich town of Port Nolloth on an £11,400 ""diamond safari"" package - the first of its kind. Participants who follow professional prospectors are ""pretty much 100 per cent"" likely to uncover gems. More far-fetched travel opportunities are on their way. If the innovators and entrepreneurs of today achieve their aims, the future of travel might look something like this: Where we will travel Nick Trend, Telegraph Travel's consumer editor, expects the destinations we frequent to change in the years to come. ""With the future of key package-holiday destinations such as Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia looking uncertain,"" he says, ""expect mainstream tour operators to tempt us to some alluring new destinations. The UK's biggest travel company, Tui, has recently launched holiday packages to Costa Rica and to the beaches of Cayo Santa Maria in Cuba, for example."" In years to come, we will roam the previously inaccessible, explore entirely new surroundings and reconsider destinations previously overlooked. Abu Dhabi, long in Dubai's shadow, is a case in point. Currently under development there is Saadiyat Island, a vast cultural district that will house world-class museums in buildings designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architects. The first to open, in 2017, will be the Jean Nouvel-designed Louvre Abu Dhabi; institutions including the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Zayed National Museum (designed by Frank Gehry and Norman Foster respectively) will follow. Environmental factors will have an increasing impact, too. Later this month, the 13-deck Crystal Serenity cruise ship, which accommodates 1,070 guests, will sail along the Northwest Passage on a 32-night voyage that extends from Anchorage to New York. Guests (paying from £16,875 each) are guaranteed spectacular views as they pass through pristine landscapes - but the trip has only been made possible by receding ice levels, and environmentalists have voiced concerns about the imposition of such a momentous vessel on vulnerable ecosystems and communities. Others will go to greater lengths to explore extreme landscapes. Elizabeth Ellis, founder of tour operator Blue Marble Private, is currently organising a trip to the wreckage of the Titanic. She expects ""exploratory travel [in] difficult-to-reach, otherworldly environments"" to become increasingly popular. In the past 12 months she has chartered flights from Cape Town to the South Pole as a part of an eight-day Antarctic trip that cost participants £50,000 apiece, and arranged for a group to fly to the edge of space on a MiG military aircraft capable of reaching altitudes of about 60,000ft, or 11.5 miles. While prohibitively priced, commercial space travel is also coming. The severely delayed Virgin Galactic is still planning to sell flights to space at $250,000 a pop; its privileged guests will soar almost 70 miles above the Earth's surface. The Bloon flights offered by Spanish company Zero2Infinity don't reach the same altitude but at €110,000 (£92, 600) per person they are somewhat cheaper. Launching in 2018, the aircraft capsule will be hoisted 22 miles into the air by balloon, in the same way as daredevil Felix Baumgartner was taken to 128,100ft on the Red Bull Stratos mission in 2012. Exploring new depths here on Earth, the proposed SeaOrbiter is an oceanic observation vessel designed to traverse previously uncharted waters on extended research missions. In addition to 12 floors of labs it will feature guest quarters; crowdfunding has provided enough revenue to partially commence construction, though it could be several years before it sails. How we will travel Trains, planes, boats and cars will continue to shuttle us hither and yon, but the form of the journeys could change markedly over the coming decade. Here are some examples. By air For moneyed travellers, supersonic flights could soon be a reality. The US company Aerion is collaborating with the Airbus Group to launch AS2, a supersonic business jet, in 2023. Expected to reach Mach 1.5, it would be 67 per cent faster than current long-range subsonic jets. Rival firm Spike Aerospace is also planning to launch a Mach 1.6 supersonic jet in the early 2020s - but with one significant difference. To reduce drag, its cabin will be devoid of windows. Instead, interior walls will be covered with all-enveloping screens on which the panorama surrounding the aircraft could be broadcast. Travel time from New York to London would be almost halved, to just 3hr 20mins. Nervous travellers might prefer to have a different type of elevated aviation experience. Described as ""the Netflix of private jets"" and launching in October, Surf Air will offer unlimited private-jet flights to subscribers paying £2,500 a month. In New York, Uber-style app Blade is making near-instant, exclusive-use and shared helicopter rides to the Hamptons and elsewhere a possibility. Sadly, it is less exciting in economy class. Major US carriers including Delta and American Airlines are competing with budget operators by introducing extra-cheap ticket options, colloquially called ""last class"". Passengers can expect cheaper-thaneconomy fares, and no frills. Among other economy-class cabin reconfigurations that have been suggested, London-based Factorydesign's Air Lair would see passengers nest in pods stacked one on top of the other in a honeycomb structure. Tim Robinson, editor of the Royal Aeronautical Society's Aerospace magazine, sees the cabin as ""a major battleground for airlines to improve the passenger experience and ultimately maximise their profitability"". He predicts innovations such as dedicated sections for passengers wanting high-speed connectivity for gaming, say, or separate zones for those with children. Cheaper oil prices, increased competition and improved aircraft should see other enhancements filter through to the mass market. Since May, low-cost airline Norwegian has offered direct flights from London to California, with one-way flights to San Francisco starting at £179, while better aircraft will take us further, and in more comfort. Increasingly common, Boeing's Dreamliners offer bigger windows and invisible but significant improvements such as better airfiltration systems; Airbus A380s can accommodate 544 passengers in a four-class configuration. When it launches next year, a 9,034-mile Qatar Airways service between Doha and Auckland will become the world's longest flight. It should take between 17.5 and 18.5 hours. Continued on page 4 PARTNERS GEHRY By rail The rail industry is attempting to reach new extremes too, and the pleasures of slow train travel are being revived by new luxury sleeper services. Belmond (the company behind the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express) will launch multi-day trips in Ireland and Peru over the next year, and Train Suite Shiki-Shima's service will offer passage through north-eastern Japan from next May. In late 2014, Golden Eagle Luxury Trains launched its Jewels of Persia tour on the first ever European train to cross into Iran. The service provides a unique opportunity to explore terrains long off-limits to all but the most intrepid travellers. Though passengers have to forego alcohol on Iranian soil, they do benefit from fine dining and comfortable private quarters. The experience is available as a Telegraph Tour escorted by rail enthusiast Michael Portillo (for details, call 03300 299 528 or see telegraph.co.uk/tt-goldeneagle). In contrast, the eponymous transit system proposed by new US company Hyperloop One is focused on speed and aims to harness electric propulsion to accelerate carriages through a tube at up to 800mph - enough to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 30 minutes. It plans to test a prototype next year. By water Cruise ships are changing and many already come with amenities and novelties to rival the best hotels. Expedition cruise company Lindblad now carries ROVs (remote-operated vehicles) which plunge to 500ft below sea level to provide high-definition video of what lurks beneath the ship; and the Scenic Eclipse, due in 2018, will be capable of sailing in polar waters and will carry two helicopters and a submarine. For total extravagance, however, nothing rivals superyachts. With basketball courts and 3D cinemas already de rigueur, owners are demanding ever more outlandish features. The proposed 295ft Moonstone would feature a faceted hull embedded with solar-powered LEDs. Activated by app, they could display the exact hues of that evening's sunset to partially camouflage the vessel. By (flying) car Currently being developed by a Slovakian company, AeroMobil is a car that converts into a plane in seconds. Prototypes have flown successfully and commercial deliveries are expected in 2018. The new £145,000 A5, meanwhile, is a two-person amphibious aircraft that can take offand touch down on both water and land. Light and easily operated, it should appeal to millionaires who are keen to kick-start their weekend breaks. Where we will stay The hospitality sector has been shaken up by the arrival of Airbnb, and various ""sharing economy"" operators are emerging in its wake. Among them, onefinestay facilitates accommodation in exceptionally luxurious homes; soon-to-launch Freebird Club is a members' club offering homestays for the over-50s. Other increasingly niche ""peer to peer"" platforms, explicitly targeting a specific demographic, are likely to follow. Already Bud and Breakfast promises access to ""cannabisfriendly"" accommodation, while KinkBNB encourages users to get to know their hosts more intimately. Travellers who are less enthused about engaging with strangers will be catered to by improvements in technology. Though their ability to hold eye contact is unnerving, the human-like robots at Japan's newly launched Henn-na Hotel can check guests in and tackle general queries without intervention from a human. Botlr, a robot butler, is currently being trialled at a number of Aloft hotels in America; some Starwood hotels are now allowing guests to check in digitally, using their smartphones as room keys; and new apps launched by the likes of the Four Seasons chain are increasingly enabling customers to execute every engagement electronically. Other hotels are being developed to provide a base for customers with specific interests. Upmarket US gym chain Equinox is set to unveil its first hotel - no doubt a haven for keep-fit fanatics and selfie-loving Instagram fans - in New York in 2018, while eco-conscious consumers are being targeted by the emerging 1 Hotels group. Among various energy-saving initiatives are bedroom taps that release ""triple-filtered"" water so guests can hydrate without recourse to the plastic bottles traditionally replenished at turndown. Who we will travel with Virtuoso, an international network of high-end travel agencies, has highlighted multigenerational travel as this year's most popular travel trend, and companies are endeavouring to satisfy simultaneously the disparate needs of toddlers, great-grandparents and everyone in between. It's a shift that is seeing hotels significantly reconfigure their inventory and a number of properties have launched highcapacity stand-alone villas that supersede their signatures suites. A lavish example is the new, hillside Villa 20 at Amanzoe in Greece (from £12,000 per night for up to 18 guests), which offers residents a cascade of private pools and lounges, in a setting 1.5 times the size of Trafalgar Square. If escaping your family is preferred, various operators cater for solo travellers. Just You's packages see single travellers gather for Budapest spa breaks and comprehensive tours of Cuba; for particularly solitary types, On Foot Holidays arranges selfguided walks across Europe. The legalisation of gay marriage is encouraging LGBT individuals to travel more openly and, according to the market research firm Forrester, the gay travel market is now worth £6billion in the UK. Launched in December, OutOfOffice.com caters to this demographic and has thrived. Predicted revenues for its first month were £50,000; the company made £250,000. As interest in specialist areas grows, you can if you wish join similarly committed fans on Game of Thronesthemed tours in Belfast, commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster with a tour, or book a package to see a future solar eclipse. Travellers who wish to record these sojourns can hire a professional photographer to accompany them in 180 destinations through Flytographer or try the Drone the World service, launched this week by Black Tomato. From Burma to Iceland, drone photographers who have worked on Star Wars and the James Bond films will shoot blockbuster-worthy footage of clients' escapades. Though our preferred means of documentation may change over time, it's nice to think our desire to remember and relive our most precious holiday experiences will always stay with us.

"Olympic-sized oil woes; Brazil's state-owned petrobras, the symbol of the country's economic misery, may also be its saviour",Norway,"It's 2006 and state-owned oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA and partners have struck a pocket of eight billion barrels of oil in the massive pre-salt offshore basin that would kick off a number of similarly large discoveries. The find has put Brazil on the oil map, with global energy observers quickly placing the South American country alongside Canada and Kazakhstan as expected leaders of non-OPEC oil production growth over the next two decades. Brazilians were already brimming with pride after U.S. investment banker Goldman Sachs in 2001 had ordained the country to be one of the four new engines - with Russia, India and China - of the global economy to replace sputtering Europe and North America. The BRIC acronym took a life of its own, propelling Brazil into the limelight, and the country rode the hype and the commodity boom, lifting millions out of poverty and instilling a more confident strut in its samba. The country's oil and economic embarrassment of riches inspired thenpresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to declare ""God was Brazilian"", while Venezuela's late president Hugo Chavez jokingly contemplated calling his counterpart 'Sheikh Lula.' The summer Olympics, following its hosting of the FIFA Soccer World Cup in 2014, was to be Brazil's perfect coming-of-age party on the beach - a grown up ready to host the world. But a decade after the giant offshore find, the country, its oil industry - and Lula himself - are in need of divine intervention. ""That moment of enthusiasm right after the oil discovery and combined with what seemed like a very favourable moment for Brazil elicited some sort of exuberancy, if not hubris,"" says Joao Augusto de Castro Neves, director of Latin America at the Washingtonbased Eurasia Group. ""There was a great degree of excessive confidence that led to increasing government intervention and brought operational and financial difficulties to Petrobras."" Brazil's list of woes is long: Brazil's current president, Dilma Rousseff, is about to be impeached and Lula himself is to stand trial; Petrobras, the standard bearer of Corporate Brazil, is mired in the worst corruption scandal in its history; the economy is in a severe recession; and the Olympics, meant to showcase the country's dynamism, are marred by - among other things - the insidious Zika virus that is keeping scores of athletes and tourists away. The mood is ""very bad"" in the country, says Fernando Luiz Lara, an associate professor of architecture at the University of Texas in Austin, who is originally from Brazil. ""We have gigantic political problems,"" says Lara who is currently holidaying in Belo Horizonte, in the southeast of the country, where he plans to watch a couple of soccer games. ""I don't see any good solution in the near future. We are in for at least two years of bad times. Then, who knows."" The economy contracted 3.8 per cent in 2015 and is set to slide another 3.3 per cent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, as the economy goes bust, and an interim government has replaced an elected government riddled by corruption and incompetence in equal measure. The Olympic Games themselves are beset by cost overruns, human rights abuses, environmental disasters and security concerns, with 60 per cent of Brazilians believing the sporting spectacle will hurt the economy, according to a recent poll by Estado de S.Paulo, a Brazilian daily newspaper. At the heart of the trouble sits Petrobras, the country's state-owned oil company, currently embroiled in a massive corruption scandal that has seen hundreds of arrests and convictions already and could set the company back by billions of dollars. In 2014, Brazilian prosecutors launched 'Operation Car Wash' (Operacao Lava Jato), its name inspired by a foreign-exchange service at a gas station in Brasilia that was used by money-launderers to wire funds to Petrobras executives' overseas accounts as kickbacks for construction contracts. Rousseff, who is not personally accused of corruption even though the alleged incidents took place during her tenure as chair of the Petrobras board, was suspended as president in May and now faces an impeachment trial on unrelated charges of breaking fiscal responsibility laws on Aug. 29. Lula, who presided over the boom period and was idolized by his countrymen, is also expected to stand trial for allegedly obstructing the Operation Car Wash investigation. Both have denied any wrongdoing and some analysts believe the charges are politically motivated and without merit. That's not how it was supposed to play out for Petrobras, once seen as the poster child for all state-owned oil enterprises. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the domestic bourse in Sao Paulo, the company was run by competent managers and boasted deep technical and managerial bench strength. With strong corporate governance in place, the company walked the tightrope of managing its commercial interests and aligning itself with the policy of the Brazil government, its largest shareholder. But the Lula era, that lifted millions from poverty and ushered in the boom period, saw government increasingly interfering in the company's operations as political appointees who came on board made political rather than commercial decisions that rapidly eroded the company's fiscal strength. ""Petrobras is a complicated beast,"" says Eurasia's Neves. ""We have seen moments in the last 15 to 20 years where Petrobras was driven by market dynamics rather than political dynamics - more recently it was the other way around. Now we are seeing the pendulum swing again."" Government creep in Petrobras saw the company's market cap fizzle to US$52.2 billion today from US$241 billion in 2007 as it became a pure policy tool, forced to keep prices down to control inflation. Petrobas' debt has ballooned fivefold over the past nine years, while net income of US$13.1 billion in 2007 shriveled to a US$1.1 billion loss in the first quarter of 2016. Analysts have cast doubt over the company's US$130-billion investment plans during the next five years. ""Our business and strategic plans are being revised and the new plans will be announced (at) the beginning of October,"" Estephani Zavarise, a Petrobras media executive, said in an emailed statement. The company declined to comment on a list of questions submitted by the Financial Post, saying it is in a quiet period until Aug. 11 when it releases its secondquarter earnings. The corruption scandal has triggered a class-action lawsuit against Petrobras in New York that has weighed on the company's outlook. The stock has lost 75 per cent of its value over the past five years, but is up 94 per cent this year to US$8.34 on Friday as analysts believe the stock is oversold. There are also concerns that Petrobras may be dragged into a domestic lawsuit that mirrors the U.S. legal action, says Bruno Meyerhof Salama, a professor of law at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas School of Law in Sao Paulo. ""The Brazilian shareholder will be hurt twice,"" Salama said. ""They are hurt because the company was mismanaged and if the company awards damages (in the U.S), they will be hurt again, which is unfair. It's a reasonable argument, but it's questionable whether the lawsuit can proceed."" On Wednesday a U.S. federal appeals court approved Petrobras' request to delay the U.S. case that was set to go to trial in September. Then there is the matter of Petrobras's massive debt load, which at US$126 billion has made it the most indebted company in the world. Last year the company unveiled a US$15.1-billion, two-year divesting program to make a dent in its debt pile. ""By 2019-20, they would like to reduce the debt leverage from five per cent, to about 2.5 per cent,"" says Ricardo Bedregal, a Rio de Janiero-based senior director upstream at IHS Markit, noting that it will bring additional challenges for the company. ""Petrobras would have to either divest or need around US$50 billion from the government to reduce this debt ratio."" Ironically, Brazil's saviour may come in the form of the offshore pre-salt basin in the Atlantic that contains at least 40 billion barrels of reserves that can be produced at a breakeven price of US$20-US$50 per barrel - which is considered an 'unbeatable' proposition compared to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Africa, says Bedregal. ""In the next five to 10 years, Petrobras will come back on the road and by 2020 Brazil would be a major player in the global oil market,"" he says. The company has been monetizing the pre-salt basin, with production from the region growing to about one million bpd today from almost zero five years ago. And that's just scratching the salty surface - the IEA estimating there are more than 100 billion barrels locked in the basin. Further production would require sinking billions of dollars to extract the riches buried under a layer of salt two kilometres thick, and 340 kilometres offshore. The combination of heavy investment requirements and Petrobas' own frail fiscal situation provides an opening for international oil companies to take greater control in the offshore basin. Brazil's interim government, led by Michel Temer, is relaxing foreign rules, especially in the pre-salt basin, and lowering local content requirements. In late July, in the depths of the oil-price gloom, Norway's Statoil ASA paid US$2.5 billion to operate and secure a 66-per-cent share in the 1.3 billion-barrel Carcara discovery, the first major oil company to gain operatorship in the pre-salt fields. During the heady days of triple-digit oil prices in 2013, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA, CNOOC Ltd. and Petro-China Co. Ltd. invested a total of US$4 billion in a pre-salt field said to contain nine billion barrels of recoverable oil. Petrobras' divestment is an opportunity for even greater foreign-investor activity, including Canadian companies. ""The government is absolutely committed to opening up the market,"" said Corey Ruttan, chief executive officer of Alvopetro Energy Ltd., a small Calgary-based explorer working in Brazil. ""Some of the policies might have been the root cause of the problem and those are being addressed,"" Ruttan said in an interview, noting that the beleaguered Brazilian real has rallied against the U.S. dollar in recent months as mergers and acquisition activity in the country pick up. Other Canadian companies are also eyeing Brazil, with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. reportedly in talks with Petrobras over the sale of natural gas pipeline unit Nova Transportadora do Sudeste SA. Brookfield declined to comment. Salama believes that Temer will proceed with the country's business-friendly reforms, starting with the oil sector. ""The agenda is huge, and many if not all the reforms are incredibly unpopular in Brazil, but he will start with oil because it's easiest ... He understands better than anyone in the country how to navigate Congress,"" says Salama, especially as major decisions require two-thirds of the house voting in favour. Austin University's Lara is less hopeful, lamenting that deep-rooted corruption and the 'resource curse' continues to plague the country. ""Michel Temer is being controlled by a number of political forces, but he will be discarded soon by the very forces that support him,"" Lara says. Others point to concerns the government will exercise increased caution when dealing with the company and its business strategy. But among the Avenida Brigadeiro Faria Lima - Brazil's version of Bay Street - there is growing optimism Petrobras will get past its troubles, especially as debt reduction remains the company's main priority. ""There should not occur political interference in the executive team composition (including subsidiaries) and both the board and the senior management will be given autonomy to run the company in its best interests, including price policy in Brazil, one of investors' main requests,"" Wesley Bernabe, chief analyst at BB Banco de Investimento SA, wrote to clients after a meeting with Petrobras's new chief executive officer Pedro Parente in June. yhussain@nationalpost.com Twitter.com/YAD_FPEnergy"
Grounded oil rig may have leaked tonnes of diesel,Norway,"Two diesel tanks have been breached on the oil platform that ran aground on the Isle of Lewis, the Maritime and Coastal Agency has announced. It said that the Transocean Winner, a 17,000-tonne drilling platform, was carrying 280 tonnes of diesel in four tanks. It said that inspectors had been on board to assess the damage but that weather conditions meant it was impossible to tell how much diesel had escaped. The beach at Dalmore, where the platform is stuck, is a surfing spot and many locals make their living from fishing or tourism. The beach has been closed and an exclusion zone of 300 metres has been set up. The platform was being towed around the western side of the island on its way from Norway to Malta when it broke free from its tug boat in a storm. No one was on board at the time. Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said that there were many unanswered questions about the incident. ""Why was it where it was, why was it still under tow, and why was it in the most dangerous spot, i.e. outside the mainland when there was a major storm forecast?"" He also asked why a rig that was due to be scrapped was carrying so much diesel. Scotland's environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said that the relevant agencies were doing what was necessary to secure the rig and minimise environmental risks."
Large cruise ship voyage through Arctic ice rekindles rows,Norway,"Campaigners say Crystal Serenity trip puts at risk very environment tourists are travelling to see in Northwest Passage A decision to proceed with plans to sail the first huge cruise liner through the Northwest Passage on Tuesday with 1,000 passengers on board has rekindled rows with environmentalists about the Arctic. The wildlife charity WWF[http://www.wwf.org.uk] has accused Crystal Cruises[http://crystal.cruiselines.com] of putting at risk “the very thing that tourists would come to see” – a pristine wilderness and home to endangered species such as polar bears and walrus. “This voyage symbolises the risk of large-scale cruise ships operating in the Arctic. The unique wildlife is already stressed by a warming climate and the loss of sea ice, and the arrival of mega-cruise ships in this part of the world could push it further towards the edge,” said Rod Downie, WWF-UK Polar programme manager. “We recognise the positive steps that Crystal Cruises have taken to minimise their impact, working with local communities and in particular choosing not to burn heavy fuel oil in the Arctic, which is more persistent and damaging to wildlife if spilled. But if tourism is not sustainable, we risk ruining the very thing that tourists would come to see.” The Crystal Serenity will set sail from Seward, Alaska, for New York on a 32-day, near 1,000-mile journey through the famous Northwest Passage waterway via Canada and Greenland. Arguments around the Arctic have more recently centred on oil company drilling such as Shell’s controversial and now abandoned attempts to explore off the coast of Alaska and new plans to open up the Norwegian far north. But the increasing scope for industrialising the region[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Opposites-Opportunities-threats-Guardian-ebook/dp/B0076KWQ7M] as the ice melts has also triggered geopolitical tensions and talk of a new cold war because the legal status of who owns what up there is uncertain[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/jun/16/drilling-oil-gas-arctic-alaska]. Michael Byers, a professor of politics and law at the University of British Columbia, says the Crystal Serenity should be used to spur new talks between the Canadian and US governments about disputed waterway rights in the Arctic[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-trudeau-should-move-now-to-safeguard-the-northwest-passage/article31382232/]. On its website, Crystal Cruises describes the cruises as a “world away from the sunny Mediterranean and the Caribbean’s white sandy beaches, cruises around the polar regions offer an entirely different adventure. “Since these are luxury cruises, you could spend your days at sea in a hot whirlpool out on deck, glass of wine in hand – or head ashore on an expedition, learning more about these remote ecosystems with the help of expert guides,” said the Los Angeles-based company. In a statement, Crystal Cruises said it was taking great care with the sailing. It had been “working on this project since 2013 and will be implementing a number of additional precautions to ensure the safety of all guests and crew, as well as to protect the pristine environment. “We have taken many extraordinary operational and equipment-related measures to ensure a safe voyage. The typical conditions along the planned route during the Arctic summer are substantially free of ice and within Crystal Serenity’s safe-operating parameters. “Of note is our intention to use ultra low-sulphur content marine gas oil, which far exceeds the current requirements in that region. This, along with a relatively slow transit speed, will achieve our goal of minimising our carbon footprint.” The Crystal Serenity will carry 1,000 passengers – some reputed to be paying up to $120,000 (£92,000) – plus 650 crew members. There is a casino, six restaurants and a cinema on board. The vessel is by far the largest luxury cruise ship to sail through these remote, icy waters. Crystal Serenity will be accompanied by an ice–strengthened polar logistics vessel, RRS Ernest Shackleton, for safety backup. The vessel is normally used by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), a publicly-funded organisation. Concerns have been raised[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36541583] about this but a spokesman for the BAS said it had no authority over how the vessel was employed in the summer months and made no financial gain from the Crystal Serenity work."
10 Europe road trips that should be on your bucket list,Norway,"The next time you head to Europe, consider applying the classic American road trip formula to your vacation abroad. Hitting the road in Europe is a great way to get off the beaten tourist path and spontaneously discover small villages, regional cuisine and friendly locals. And you'll surely find plenty of roadside attractions (just maybe not a giant ball of twine). Here are 10 of the best road trip routes to try in Europe. Romantic Road, Germany The Romantic Road, or Romantische Strasse in German, is one of Germany's most popular tourist routes. That's because it gives visitors a taste of everything that makes the country idyllic: vineyards and the palace in Wurzburg, medieval towns like Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and the soaring Alps and fairytale-like Neuschwanstein Castle near Fussen. No matter what you like to do when you travel, there's something for you along or just off the Romantic Road -- from spa towns to fortified villages. Length: About 240 miles. Best detour: From the southern-most point of the Romantic Road in Fussen, Germany's highest peak, Zugspitze, is about an hour away. Don't forget: Rothenburg ob der Tauber is home to the Kathe Wohlfahrt headquarters. Save room in your luggage for typical German holiday decor, like wooden incense smokers and handmade ornaments. Bordeaux, France, to Bilbao, Spain For anyone who appreciates food, the drive between France and Spain from Biarritz to Bilbao is packed with Michelin-starred restaurants (several of which appear on the 2016 World's 50 Best Restaurants list) and enough food variety to keep even the pickiest traveler satisfied. Start in Bordeaux vineyards with a wine-tasting course at Maison du Vin de Bordeaux before exploring the UNESCO World Heritage-listed city center. In Biarritz, it's all about the beaches like Cote des Basques with Villa Belza, a 19th-century chateau, as your backdrop. Dine at acclaimed Elkano in Getaria, near San Sebastian. Finish the trip in Bilbao with pintxos at Irrintzi. Length: About 208 miles. Best detour: Axpe, Spain, is only about 20 minutes south from Durango off the main road between San Sebastian and Bilbao, but it's worth it for a stop at Asador Etxebarri, where Basque barbeque meets ingredients from the sea in an unassuming village. Don't forget: Make reservations in advance for restaurant heavy-hitters like Mugaritz in San Sebastian (Spain), or L'Impertinent in Biarritz (France). Normandy, France The Normandy coast, best known for its role in the D-Day landings, is a must-visit for history buffs. Begin the trip in Etretat for a walk along the white chalky cliffs with views of natural sea arches. Seaside towns, in particular Hornfleur and Trouville-sur-Mer, are worth a stop. From this direction, Juno Beach is the first of the Operation Overlord beaches you'll hit. About 50 miles of coastline separate it from Utah Beach. Other sobering points of interest include the artificial quays seen at low tide in Arromanches, the American Cemetery at Omaha Beach, and enormous shell craters at Pointe du Hoc. Continue the trip on a more light-hearted note to Mont St. Michel (beware: tourist crowds are no joke) before heading inland to the tiny town of Camembert to sample its the famed cheese of the same name. Finish the trip in Monet's Giverny. Length: About 430 miles. Best detour: Cross into Brittany from Normandy for a visit to St. Malo, about an hour from Mont St. Michel. The walled-in town was once a port for privateers and is now a short ferry ride from the Channel Islands. Don't forget: In addition to cheese, the region is known for its cider and calvados, or apple brandy. If you don't drive by a roadside stand or two, you may be in the wrong place. Trollstigen National Tourist Route, Norway Also known as the Troll's Route, this mountain road, designated as one of Norway's national tourist routes, affords drivers with views of mountains, waterfalls like the Seven Sisters, and the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Geirangerfjord. Like any road trip, this one is best when you get out and explore the areas of the drive between Valldalen and Andalsnes. Get up close to the area's waterfalls by kayaking Geirangerfjord. There are also several historic fjord farms, including Skagefla and Knivsfla. Length: About 65 miles. Best detour: Dovrefjell-Sundalsfjella National Park, a protected alpine area, is home to reindeer, musk ox and wolverines. Hiking and fishing, particularly for trout, are good reasons to stop. Don't forget: Consider traveling in summer as you'll have more daylight, which means more time to explore. High Alpine Road, Austria The Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse, or High Alpine Road, takes drivers through Hohe Tauren National Park in the eastern Alps with views of Austria's highest mountain, Grossglockner, as well as Pasterze, the longest glacier in the country at about 5 miles. Beyond the 36 hairpin turns, you'll want to get out of the car for a hike to any of the alpine huts dotting the landscape, or go further into the national park for hikes like the easy 5-mile round-trip trail to Stappitzer Lake. Length: About 30 miles, or about 185 miles from Salzburg to Carinthia via Grossglockner. Best detour: From Grossglockner, it's only about 2. 5 hours onward to picturesque towns in the Dolomites, like Cortina d' Ampezzo, or Bled, Slovenia, bordering Triglav National Park. Don't forget: The road closes in early November and reopens in early May, with gates closing at nighttime during the season. Tickets cost 35 euros for a day pass or 41 euros round-trip per car. Electric vehicles and motorcycles receive a discount. Athens to Olympia, Greece While Greece's islands usually hog the vacation spotlight, the mainland is the perfect place for countryside cruising. Start in Athens to explore the ruins (Acropolis, Parthenon, the Temple of Hephaestus, etc. ) before hitting the road to the Laconia countryside. Visit Sparta, the modern city believed to be the site of ancient Sparta, if only to pass through on your way to Mystras. The archeological site of medieval ruins sits among a breathtaking landscape and has the distinction of being on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Finish the trip in Olympia to take in the ruins of temples and the ancient Olympic Games before heading back to Athens. Length: About 420 miles. Best detour: To add more seaside to your trip, head south to Cape Matapan (also known as Cape Tainaron), the southernmost point of mainland Greece. The drive is just over 60 miles from either Mystras or Sparta. Don't forget: The Museum of the Olive and Greek Olive Oil in Sparta is worth a stop for lovers of the Mediterranean fruit. Tuscany, Italy Begin with a visit to Florence before packing up the wheels and taking off into the Tuscan countryside. The first stop is Orvieto, a hilltop town known for its Gothic cathedral, network of caves and Classico wine. Leave your car at the bottom of the hill for free and head up to the medieval town. Make the trip a loop by taking in some of Italy's less-visited coastal areas, starting with Talamone, a small fishing village with an ancient castle towering over it. From there, the beaches of Marina di Grosseto and the Riserva Naturale Scarlino in Follonica are worth stops. The area is known for its agriturismo, so look for farmhouse accommodations. Head back toward Florence with stops in Siena and Castellina in Chianti. Length: About 340 miles. Best detour: Rome is less than 80 miles from Orvieto. As they say, when in (almost) Rome . . . Don't forget: The unleaded gasoline in Italy is benzina verde. Don't use gasolio or diesel unless you have a diesel rental car. Ring of Kerry, Ireland The Irish countryside is the ideal setting for a road trip any time of year. The Ring of Kerry, a route circling the Iveragh Peninsula, gives you variety with mountains and medieval villages, beaches and lakes. The chiseled coastline offers dramatic views, while cozy pubs along the way provide the perfect spot to pop in for a pint and wait out any inclement weather. (But don't drink and drive, obviously. ) Get out for a walk along a stretch of the Kerry Way, a nearly 125-mile walking trail, and pay a visit to Ross Castle and Rossbeigh Beach. Make your trip more relaxing by adding in extra overnight stops at the area's bed-and-breakfasts, renowned for their hospitality. Length: About 110 miles (add 80 miles for the drive from Shannon Airport to Killarney). Best detour: The Cliffs of Moher are about 115 miles north of Killarney. The cliffs stretch 5 miles and tower more than 700 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. From here, you can drive more of the Wild Atlantic Way to extend your trip. Don't forget: Ireland is known for its unpredictable weather. Pack a raincoat and know that while the drive will inevitably be beautiful, you may not get crystal clear views for miles out to sea. Transfagarasan Mountain Road/Highway, Romania Made famous by Top Gear, Romania's national road 7C or Transfagarasan Mountain Road takes you through the Fagaras Mountains, part of the Carpathian range. The maximum speed is 25 miles per hour to account for the hairpin turns and steep climbs. Crossing viaducts and and driving through tunnels, you'll pass through the Arges River gorge and by Poenari Castle, infamous for its connection to Vlad the Impaler (the supposed inspiration for Count Dracula). Stick to 7C around Vidraru Lake, as it's better maintained than the road going along the other side. Check road conditions before you plan your trip, as the road is usually closed from October to June. Length: About 56 miles. Best detour: Bran Castle, commonly called Dracula's Castle, is just over 60 miles from Cartisoara, at the northern point of the Transfagarasan Mountain Road. Add 10 extra miles if you head to Bran from the southern point of the road in Bascov. Don't forget: Splurge on a rental car upgrade. Why not? Ring Road, Iceland Route 1 circles the entire country of Iceland, thus its nickname -- the Ring Road. Starting and ending in Reykjavik makes sense for most travelers flying into the country. Give yourself plenty of time for stopping and exploring the varying otherworldly landscape and dramatic fjords, like Eyjafjordur. Volcanically active areas with lava fields, geysers, mud pools and other geothermal features near Lake Myvatn in the north contrast dramatically with the Vatnajokull ice cap in the southeast, making the case for Iceland's name. In the west, just off Route 1, Thingvellir National Park (also a UNESCO World Heritage Site) shows another side of the islands with rocky outcrops and greenery surrounding traces of Vikings remains. Length: About 830 miles. Best detour: The so-called Diamond Circle is about a 160-mile loop in the northern part of the country. Some of that overlaps Route 1, but get off it to see the coastal town of Husavik, canyon of Asbyrgi and Dettifoss waterfall. Don't forget: Rent a four-wheel drive vehicle so you can tackle any spontaneous trips off the main road. READ THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE: 10 Europe road trips that should be on your bucket list"
Marianne Ihlen,Norway,"Muse and lover of Leonard Cohen who inspired his song So Long, Marianne When Leonard Cohen heard that Marianne Ihlen was dying of leukaemia, he wrote to thank her for the “beauty” and “wisdom” of her life. The letter was a fitting coda to the song So Long, Marianne, which he had written for her half a century earlier and which became perhaps his most celebrated composition. Ihlen was Cohen’s early muse and lover, inspiring a number of the songs on his first two albums. She was a striking and sensitive Scandinavian blonde goddess, described by Cohen as “the most beautiful woman in the world”. She appeared on the back cover of his second album, Songs From A Room, in a grainy black-and-white photograph, sitting at a desk in the corner of a sparsely furnished whitewashed room, wrapped in a towel and smiling bashfully for the camera. It was an idyllic image of romantic bohemian youth and was taken on the Greek island of Hydra, where they lived together in the early 1960s in a house that Cohen had bought for 1500 US dollars. Ihlen had moved to the island in 1958 with her husband, the Norwegian writer Axel Jensen, and their young son, also Axel. She recalled the electricity of her first meeting with the tanned and ruggedly handsome Cohen. Fifty years later she could still remember what he was wearing: khaki trousers, a faded green shirt, and brown tennis shoes. “I was standing in a shop with my basket waiting to pick up bottled water and milk. Then, there he was standing in the door way. With the sun behind him, you don’t see the face, just the contours, and so I hear his voice saying, ‘Would you like to join us? Come into the sun. We’re sitting outside.’ When my eyes met his, I felt it throughout my body.” The Canadian-born Cohen was then a novelist and poet who had not begun setting his lyrics to music. He had often observed Ihlen walking along the waterfront with her husband and child and thought they made “a beautiful holy trinity”. He later said that he “had no idea that I would spend the next decade with this man’s wife”. When Jensen abandoned Marianne for an American painter, Cohen stepped into the breach, but they did not immediately become lovers. “Though I loved him from the moment we met, it was a beautiful, slow movie,” she said. During their courtship Cohen accompanied her and her son to the beach and read her his poetry. When she had to return to Norway to finalise her divorce, Cohen drove her the 2,500 miles from Athens to Oslo. Their life together in Hydra was described in Kari Hesthamar’s book, So Long, Marianne: A Love Story. Living on a shoestring, Cohen spent his days writing the poetry that would appear in his collection Flowers for Hitler and the novels The Favourite Game and Beautiful Losers, while she kept the household. At night young Axel — to whom Cohen became a surrogate father — was left with a babysitter while he and Ihlen caroused in the harbour-front tavernas. When she drank wine, she “danced and became wild and beautiful and threatening and dangerous if you were a man with her,” Cohen recalled. “We lay in the sun, we listened to music, we bathed, we played, we drank, we discussed. There was writing and lovemaking. It was absolutely fabulous,” Marianne said. She inspired another of Cohen’s signature songs, Bird on the Wire. Ihlen had seen the birds perched on the island’s new telephone wires and suggested he write a song about it. He came up with the lines:Like a bird on the wire, like a drunk in a midnight choir, I have tried, in my way, to be free. The song was covered by dozens of artists including Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Judy Collins and Joe Cocker.When Cohen first wrote So Long, Marianne it was not intended as a farewell, and was entitled Come On, Marianne. “It was like ‘c’mon, if we can just keep this boat afloat’,” she recalled. During a trip back to Montreal to meet his publishers, however, he altered its title. “I didn’t think I was saying goodbye, but I guess I was,” he later said, lending poignancy to the song’s opening verse:Come over to the window, my little darling, I’d like to try to read your palm. I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy before I let you take me home. Now so long, Marianne, it’s time that we began to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again. When he decided to stay in North America to launch his singing career he sent her a telegram which read, “Have a flat. All I need is my woman and her child.” She flew to join him in Montreal with young Axel. Cohen, though, had numerous other lovers, including Janis Joplin and Joni Mitchell. Their relationship finally ended when another girlfriend, Suzanne Eldrod (who was not the Suzanne of his famous song with the same name), gave birth to Cohen’s son, Adam, in 1972. Ihlen returned to Norway and found stability when she married for a second time in 1979, to Jan Stang, who survives her. She spent the rest of her life living in Oslo, working in the personnel department of an oil company, painting and exploring Tibetan Buddhism. Born in the tiny coastal village of Larkollen, Norway, in 1935, she was brought up during the war years by her grandmother in a small beachside house, which she later inherited. By her teens she wanted to become an actress and applied for drama school. “I was opposed by my mother and father, lost my courage and didn’t dare. So I ran away from home,” she said. By the time she was 23 she had married Jensen in Athens and moved with him to Hydra, where she “sat at his feet while he wrote and carried the groceries uphill from the harbour to our home. We had an outside loo, there was electricity only one hour in the evening and one hour in the morning. Otherwise, we used paraffin lamps. Axel and I walked barefoot. We had two clean t-shirts and two pairs of trousers each.” The island attracted not only bohemians and artists but the jet-set, too, who enjoyed its unspoilt, tourist-free ambience. “They came down on weekends, with a cook, a maid and servant and all that. So we were invited to these cocktail parties, six o’clock, drinks before dinner, and there we met Onassis,” she remembered. “Jacqueline Kennedy was there, and Princess Margaret too.” She never sought to trade on her connection with Cohen, although they remained in touch. When he performed in Oslo in 2010, she attended the concert; she did not go backstage but “sensed” that he knew she was there. When her friend Jan Christian Mollestad contacted Cohen to tell him that she was dying, the letter he wrote her was as poetic as the song he named after her: “Well Marianne, it’s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine. You know that I’ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.”Marianne Ihlen, muse, was born on May 18, 1935. She died of leukaemia on July 29, 2016, aged 81"
Norway builds Arctic border fence as it gives migrants the cold shoulder,Norway,"NORWAY is building a 12ft-high fence along its Arctic border with Russia to prevent migrants entering the country and seeking asylum. The Sunday Times was given exclusive access last week to the restricted border area around the Storskog crossing, about 200 miles into the Arctic Circle, where the fence is being built on the only road connecting the two countries. The move is part of a controversial overhaul of Norway's asylum system, hitherto one of the most generous in the world, after more than 31,000 people from more than 50 nations sought asylum in the country of just 5m people last year. Nearly 6,000 of them poured in via the Arctic route from Russia, overwhelming the scarcely populated municipality. The crossing cuts though a tranquil landscape of birch forests and pristine lakes. The quiet of the Arctic autumn is disturbed only by the sound of diggers and heavy equipment. Stein Kristian Hansen, superintendent of the Norwegian border police, said the fence would allow him to lock down the border crossing area in case of emergencies like that last November, when thousands of migrants arrived on bicycles, using a legal loophole that bans travellers from crossing on foot. Coming from countries with mild winter, many were unprepared for the cold climate and wore socks on their hands to protect themselves from the cold, leaving local services scrambling to prevent a humanitarian disaster in a region where winter temperatures drop to -30C. ""Our fence will not have razor wire; it's a friendly, Norwegian fence,"" Hansen said with a grin, rejecting comparisons to the much-criticised border fence built by Hungary last year to keep out refugees. Norway, traditionally liberal and extremely affluent thanks to its massive oil and gas reserves, has, until now, taken pride in being a haven for asylum seekers. Although not a member of the European Union, it is part of the passport-free Schengen area, and authorities in Oslo, the capital, said fortifying its border with Russia was part of a Europe-wide crackdown on irregular migration. The fence — built in an area that will soon be turned by the harsh polar winter into a forbidding frozen desert, where illegal crossing is nearly impossible — is also intended to send out a clear message that Norway, too, is now closed for migrants. ""A strict but fair asylum policy is important if we are to succeed in integrating the applicants who are eligible ... to stay in Norway,"" said Sylvi Listhaug, the immigration minister. During the Cold War, the border was a flashpoint between the then Soviet Union and Nato, of which Norway is a member. After more than two decades of good co-operation between Norway and Russia, the West's relationship with the Kremlin deteriorated again following Moscow's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, and the building of a tall fence is highly controversial in a country keen to maintain good relations with its giant neighbour. Rune Rafaelsen, the mayor of Kirkenes, the border municipality, is one of the most vocal critics of the fence, which he dismissed as a merely ""symbolic"" move to deter migrants and harden the stance towards Russia. ""There are enough walls in Europe to protect us from refugees and migration. We don't need high but purely symbolic fences to deal with an already complicated neighbour,"" Rafaelsen said. Kirkenes's links with Russia run deep: the Red Army liberated the province from Nazi occupation during the Second World War, and the local economy has been highly dependent on trade and tourism links with Russia since the closure of an iron-ore mine, which was a key employer. Rafaelsen refers to the television series Occupied — in which the Kremlin covertly invades Norway with a mixture of hybrid warfare and economic pressure — as an example of how the ""fear of Russia"" plays out in Norwegian politics. Norway's migration dilemma is shared across Europe, as governments, desperate to prevent another wave of mass migration and curb a surge in support for populist far-right parties, resort to restrictive measures to deter asylum seekers. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who opened her county's borders last summer as part of her Wilkommenskultur, or welcoming culture, is slowly performing a U-turn after being faced with sinking approval ratings and the rise of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. ""The most important thing for the coming months is deportation, deportation and more deportation,"" Merkel thundered last week. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union is facing potential humiliation in elections today in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, her home state in northeast Germany, where it could be pushed into third place behind the AfD, which has campaigned on an anti-immigrant ticket. The Social Democrats are expected to win. Anti-migrant feeling is also a growing force in central Europe: Hungary has called a referendum on October 2 over EU plans to introduce compulsory quotas to resettle migrants in member states. Even Norway's neighbour Sweden — a self-proclaimed ""humanitarian superpower"" that attracted hundreds of thousands of people during decades of its open-door asylum policy — is now putting the brakes on migration. Norwegian officials, meanwhile, say none of the thousands of refugees who arrived last year have stayed in the Kirkenes municipality; many have been sent back on flights to Moscow via Oslo at great expense, after complaints that pushing them back into the polar region would violate their human rights. Back at the border crossing, Hansen said it was up to the politicians to determine who was entitled to asylum, but added that many of the migrants hailed from countries untouched by war or disaster: ""Many came from Syria, but others were from places like north Africa and even some tropical islands,"" he said. ""They didn't look like they needed protection."" A British warship will arrive off the Libyan coast in the next few days as part of an EU mission to intercept and arrest people smugglers in the Mediterranean. @bopanc Fortress Europe There will soon be more walls and fences on Europe's borders than during the Cold War Borders with fenced sections Completed or under construction Planned 31,000 people from more than 50 nations sought refuge in Norway last year asylum-seekers entered Norway via Russia last year 6,000"
Arctic nations square up as clamour for resources grows,Norway,"With the Danes rebuffing Russia, and Canada laying further claim to the Northwest Passage, rising access to north pole reserves risks flashpoints Kristian Jensen, Denmark’s foreign minister, gave a precise response last week to a request by Russia for the nations to enter bilateral talks over the ownership of the north pole. He flatly rejected the move. “We need to apply the international rules,” he told reporters. The Russian request and the swift Danish response are intriguing. The United Nations is currently assessing Russian, Danish and Canadian claims to own sizeable chunks of the Arctic seabed. The Russian move was generally viewed as an attempt to strike a deal that would cut out Canada, while Denmark appears to believe its case is strong enough to exclude such manoeuvres. One thing is clear. The Arctic is heating up in meteorological, political and environmental terms as nations fall over themselves to exploit the region. Apart from Denmark’s rebuff of Russia’s Arctic overtures, Canadian explorers announced last week they had discovered the wreck of HMS Terror[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt], one of the two ships belonging to British explorer Sir John Franklin’s doomed attempt to sail the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. (The other expedition ship, Erebus, was discovered two years ago.) These two vessels have enormous symbolic importance because Canada believes they support its claim to own the passage, which other nations, such as the US, argue is international waters. Then there were the recent moves by China to invest in mines in Greenland[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt], where declining ice cover is exposing vast outcrops of ores, including minerals crucial to mobile phone manufacture. Similarly, drilling companies are eyeing seabed reserves of natural gas and oil while travel companies are preparing to send huge cruise liners into the region. The first of these trips, by the Crystal Serenity[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises], has just been completed. Enormous forces, political and commercial, are bearing down on the region although all have a common root – as was also highlighted last week. Summer sea ice, which once covered 7.5 million sq km around the north pole, this year dropped to 4.13m sq km, its second lowest figure on record, it was announced.[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded] The rate of annual change – brought about by soaring fossil fuel emissions and rises in global temperatures – is now equivalent to a loss greater than the size of Scotland. “Loss of sea ice has local to global effects, from animals and ecosystems to encouraging further warming by exposing ocean water,” said Twila Moon, at Bristol University. “We should all be shocked by the dramatic changes happening in the Arctic.” Most scientists now expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of the century. By “free” they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by “reliably”, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however. “The Arctic is opening up, and all sorts of flashpoints lie ahead,” said Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. “If the central Arctic Ocean is freed of ice for several months a year, who will control the fishing and the dumping of waste there? The Russians have also made it clear they want to drill for oil and gas.” This point was also stressed by Professor Chris Rapley, of University College London. “An increasingly ice-free Arctic is a geopolitical game changer,” he said. Already there are profound changes, with invasive species pouring into the warming Arctic and threatening existing populations, according to Melanie Lancaster of WWF’s Arctic programme. “Specialised Arctic species such as polar bears [are already] showing signs of stress. Conservation action is urgently needed.” However, the Arctic, its wildlife and its four million inhabitants face a major handicap: the region’s lack of centralised protection and control. The Antarctic Treaty bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military and strictly monitors all environmental hazards around the south pole. By contrast, although no nation owns the north pole, the Arctic nations – Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark – have very different ideas about how to run the world’s most northerly regions. “Arctic environmental protection is currently determined by individual nations, by politicians who often meet far from its borders: in Moscow, Copenhagen and Washington,” said Professor Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia. “They have very different levels of commitment to protecting the environment – with Russia at the bottom and the Nordic nations at the top.” And it is not just the Arctic nations who are eyeing up the riches around the north pole. China recently assigned itself the status of being “a near-Arctic state”. It views the opening Arctic seas as an opportunity to maintain its access to the world’s most important resources. Some of the Earth’s major stocks of fish are migrating north as the planet heats up while the Arctic’s mineral resources are being exposed by retreating ice. “The Chinese have made no secret that they have their eyes on the Arctic’s fish and minerals,” said Dodds. This raises the question of what the Inuit and other Arctic people think about resources being exploited by others. “They are not against resource development but they do like to be consulted and involved,” said Dodds. “They do not want to be cheated. However, there are often disagreements within communities about the choices they have to make. Will a mining development ruin a village’s tourist potential, for example?” Byers was cautious. “I have enormous sympathy for the local peoples in the Arctic but they are few in number and have limited resources. They are trying to insert themselves into the decision-making of some of the most powerful companies and countries in the world,” he said. Relations with indigenous people are one of the flashpoints that may trigger serious disputes in the region. There is already bitterness among the Inuit about their treatment in the past and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is currently investigating the serious abuse that thousands of children received[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/canada-dark-of-history-residential-schools] in residential schools last century. That resentment could colour future attempts to develop the region. Of all the Arctic nations, Russia has been the most determined to exploit the region as it warms, however. “You can see that determination in the way it responded to the Arctic 30 incident,” said Duncan Depledge, Director, All-Party Parliamentary Group for Polar Regions Secretariat. In 2013, Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform as part of a protest against Arctic oil production. Russians arrested them at gunpoint[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic] and charged the activists initially with piracy and later with hooliganism and only released them after two months of detention. “That is an indication of how seriously they take the Arctic,” added Depledge. This point was backed by Dodds: “The Russians are hell bent on showing the world they mean business here.” Could that determination lead to an outbreak of hostilities? Byers was not convinced. “The Arctic is a very expensive region in which to operate and Russia is not a wealthy country. The cost of militarising the Arctic would be prohibitive. They might want to police it so that they can control outfits like Greenpeace but I don’t see them having a war with another Arctic nation.” The implications for the region are still worrying, nevertheless. As Rapley stated: “The ongoing thinning [of Arctic summer sea ice] is especially significant and the implications are profound. The Arctic nations are jostling for advantage, and the economic and ecological consequences of new trade routes opening up have yet to unfold. The changes that have occurred have been greater and faster than predicted. The planet is sending a clear message: time is running out.”"
"The ""Frozen"" storm rages on at Disney World and Disneyland",Norway,"Kids may be Finding Dory, blissing out in Zootopia, and uncovering The Secret Life of Pets this year, but Frozen retains its icy grip as the top grossing animated film of all time. It's no wonder then that Disney, the king of synergy (especially when it concerns its princesses), opened two new attractions based on the regal entourage from Arendelle at its theme parks this past summer. ""Frozen - Live at the Hyperion,"" debuted in late May at Disney California Adventure (the park that is adjacent to Disneyland). The stage musical replaces a presentation of Aladdin that had been running at the 2,000-seat Hyperion Theater since 2003. The show's creative and production team includes members who worked on the park's Aladdin musical as well as Tony award-winning vets. The ambitious new show follows the Broadway-caliber formula established by its critically acclaimed predecessor. And by ambitious, I mean the 65-minute ""Frozen"" production includes a cast and crew in excess of 200, elaborately staged scenes, and some engaging special effects. Befitting its movie roots, the show incorporates imagery that merges filmed sequences with the live performances. It also introduces charming interpretations of Sven the reindeer and scene-stealer Olaf the snowman crafted by Michael Curry. The pioneering puppet designer helped develop similar live theater characters for the Broadway adaptation of ""The Lion King. "" The story is basically a condensed version of the film and is anchored by musical numbers including ""For the First Time in Forever,"" ""Love Is an Open Door,"" and, of course, the ubiquitous ""Let It Go. "" That showstopper includes pixie dust flourishes such as Queen Elsa ascending a grand staircase enhanced by projection-mapped snow crystals. ""Frozen"" is about 20 minutes longer than the park's Aladdin musical and could test the patience of squirmy toddlers. Then again, most of the toddlers in the audience of any given show have probably seen the nearly two-hour ""Frozen"" movie countless times, albeit in doses at home. If the familiar characters and songs don't keep them hooked, the ""snow showers"" and other large-scale effects surely will. Before or after the show, fans, squirmy or otherwise, can meet Anna, Elsa, and Olaf in the Hollywood Land section of Disney California Adventure. Disney is preparing a Broadway production of ""Frozen"" that is set to debut in 2018. Those who pine for Aladdin's quip-laden blue genie can still see him and the rest of the cast live on stage on Broadway and in touring productions. At Florida's Walt Disney World, Olaf and Sven began inviting boatloads of guests in late June to take a journey from the bay of Arendelle to visit Elsa's summer ice palace in Frozen Ever After in the Norway pavilion at Epcot. The ride features sophisticated animatronics, including a remarkably agile Olaf ice skating (in this fictional world, snow and ice persist year-round, apparently) and Elsa belting out ""Let It Go. "" That's a cue for the boats to head backwards as ice walls rise in sync with the song's crescendos. Elsa's snowman bodyguard, Marshmallow, blows the boats forward and down a mildly thrilling hill. It's calm enough that Frozen Ever After has no height restriction, and even the youngest passengers (and wimpiest adults) should be able to handle it. Unlike Disney California Adventure's relatively long stage production, Frozen Ever After lasts a mere few minutes. Instead of attempting to tell a story, it reintroduces the well-known characters and their ear candy songs in a new setting. The repurposed attraction uses the conveyance system and show building of Maelstrom, the featured ride at Epcot's Norway pavilion since 1988. The boats in the original attraction also reversed direction. Adjacent to the ride, visitors can have an audience with Anna and Elsa at their ""Royal Sommerhus"" meet and greet, where they're available for photos and autographs. The ladies may even consent to a song snippet if you ask nicely. When the royal duo first set up shop at Disney World soon after the film debuted, lines swelled to hours, and disappointed fans were often shut out. While they are still a huge draw, the initial furor has abated. Also, guests can now reserve times to meet the pair. Conceived as a permanent world's fair with lands devoted to the future and to various nations, Epcot has had a mostly staid, edu-tainment focus. (Initially, Disney even banned Mickey and their other classic characters from the park. ) Maelstrom, for example, included depictions of Norwegian oil rigs and touted the country's history and tourist attractions. With the Frozen overlay, the Mouse appears to be signaling a willingness to, er, let it go, and embrace more whimsy and kid-friendly fun at Epcot."
"Gateway to Fjord country; Norway’s superb transport infrastructure makes exploring the stunning landscapes easy and exciting, and Bergen is the perfect portal into that quasi-mythical world, writes Jamie Ball",Norway,"How is it that a city so surrounded by, and engulfed in, water manages to burn to a cinder again and again over the centuries? Fjord-smooching Bergen is doused in about 2.25m of rain a year. More than three times the rainfall of Dublin, for example, it was clearly not enough to quench over a dozen great fires that have gutted the Norwegian city since the 12th century. Consequently, a ""Bergenser"" out of the rain is like a fish out of water, but don't they wear it well? Like walking-talking Helly Hansen fit models, the men are so all-weathered and virile-looking they might once have been breastfed cod liver oil, while the women mostly share the same aquatic-eyed, elf-faced aspect, as if conceived beneath some statuesque toadstool. Norwegians play it straight, but not stiff. You will see no rows of prefect-perfect pedestrians stacked upon the sidewalk of a deserted street, waiting for the little green man. A contented people, in equal parts calm and quietly confident, most speak at least rudimentary English; long enough to reveal a dry, understated humour lacing much of their conversation. Founded in 1070 and translating as the ""meadow among the mountains"", west coast Bergen drove the nation's economic pulse until less than 200 years ago, when Oslo took over the throne. It's certainly not one of Europe's most beautiful cities, but it's far from unappealing - especially if perusing a pleasant day strolling the Bryggen (colourful, reconstructed Hanseatic buildings on the harbour), taking the cable car up Mount Fløyen (lording over the city centre) or exploring the worthy KODE arts museum buildings over a leisurely, saturated afternoon. But the truth is that Bergen is best served as a portal to the surrounding fjord country, so much of which (including all of the following) can be accessed within a day's journeying north from the city, via ferries, trains and motorways. You could be forgiven for surmising that the cloud-choked Norwegian fjords are akin to New Zealand's South Island on Prozac, but it's only when sacred flashes of sunlight alight, your lips part in ""wow"" at some of the most stunning scenery in Europe. But most of the other time, the steep, densely wooded valleys cast beneath brooding Nordic skies imbue everything with a Munch melancholy. About halfway along the deep, 180km-long Sognefjord is the beguiling town of Balestrand, set among some of the most painted mountainscapes in northern Europe. Its notoriety began with the translation of the Icelandic saga Fritjof the Warrior in 1825, which helped spur a 19th century Nordic cultural revival, propelling landscape artists into places such as Balestrand. Much like our own Celtic Renaissance, it helped spur a nationalist drive that climaxed in Norway's independence from Sweden in 1905. The successful artists and writers created ""dragon-style"" houses across the orchard-strewn town: Palladian wooden villas in the misnomered ""Swiss"" style between the 1890s and 1920s. Of its 1,400 inhabitants, the most eccentric is said to be a wealthy septuagenarian known as ""The Elizabeth"" who tags the town by night in anti-ageist graffiti. Bolstered by the flow of North Sea oil money, Norway's superb rural infrastructure would put most nations to shame in the unfailing quality of its roads and railways, ferry services and public lighting. The poster child of that infrastructure is the 18 National Tourist routes that lattice the spine of the country - 10 of which criss-cross fjord country. The routes parade vanguard viewing points and rest areas showcasing that post-modern groove where minimalist Scandinavian architecture, engineering, landscape architecture and land art meet to moonlight as portals to regional culture, history and nature. On the Gaularfjellet National Tourist Route, the Utsikten (""The View"") viewing platform opened last summer to the tune of €2 million, marketed in spin-free Nordy-speak as a ""large triangular concrete slab with corners that are bent upwards"". Perched on the lip of a mountain, it's certainly that and much more besides: a tribute to Norwegian design and resolve. South of Gaularfjellet is the Aurlandsfjellet National Tourist Route. This is Jølster, where grass-roofed, Hansel and Gretel-style houses built over several centuries dot the roadside as bell-braced ewes wander the mountains through summer. Salmon-laden rivers spill down mountainsides in a Valhalla of white water frenzy. The Stegastein viewing point also offers jaw-dropping scenery atop of a cutting-edge platform akin to some inverted ski-jump of wood, concrete and glass. Across the valley floor squat placid lakesides along which generations of smallholders have raised the hemline between the water and the woods to reveal bountiful paddocks; places where petite, white, wooden churches signal villages with Volvos and Audis galore. On the south side of Jølstravatnet fjord rests Astruptunet, home of painter, illustrator and graphic artist Nikolai Astrup (1880-1928), one of the country's most renown artists. Inspired by the shifting weather patterns and light and mountains of Jølster, Astrup's uncomplicated naturalism seems fittingly Norwegian. Dying of pneumonia at just 47, for the last 15 years of his life Astrup lived and worked with his large young family at these Hobbit-esque, earth-roofed timber buildings and gardens, nestled into a terraced hillside overlooking a ghostly fjord. His artwork remains largely unknown outside his own nation, but Norwegians seem to agree that this sleeping giant is soon to awaken. Having stayed the night in tranquil Marifjøra on Sognefjord, we cross the fjord by ferry to the Urnes Stave Church, a Unesco World Heritage site, which dates from 1130. A medieval, wooden church building, once littered about north-western Europe, the stave (or upright) church style ceased in 1350 with the arrival of the Black Death in Norway. To step into such a church is to breathe in muffled centuries of worship, witness and history. It's all about the wood, which almost seems animate and conscious compared to the unyielding, stoic stone of our own Irish churches. Urnes is the oldest preserved stave church in the world - of more than 1,000 originally, less than 30 survive; its dark wood and ornate carvings are thought to have been inspired by the Book of Kells. Arcing south for the slow, rewarding journey back to Bergen, the hour-long Flåm Line Railway serves as an exhibition of thunderous waterfalls thoughtfully laid out between Heidi-esque chalets and sloping pastures, as the rail line plays peek-a-boo between a checklist of tunnels. Ascending the valley of Flåmsdalen, where mythical huldra (earthy sirens that lured men into the woods to meet their end) were said to have resided, the scenery could serve as a Norwegian alternative to The Sound of Music. The train stops at one gargantuan waterfall and after we step out, recorded music pounds out as a blonde huldra emerges from the drizzle in a red silken gown, high up the hanging valley, and pulling dance moves like some confused love child of Wonder Woman and Eric the Viking. I suspect her idea of foreplay would be a headlock. We soon pile back on the train and I giggle all the way back to Bergen."

"Europe’s youth unemployment crisis stokes generational divide; With high youth unemployment showing few signs of abating, social unrest perils grow and populist politics gains a firmer foothold",Norway,"PALERMO, ITALY -- Italy is a Group of Seven industrialized country. You would not know that in Sicily, the host of the next G7 summit, in May. If it were a nation, you could be forgiven for thinking it’s a failed state. The unemployment rate on the once-wealthy island is more than 22 per cent. Far more shocking is the youth unemployment, at 56 per cent. Additionally, many young adults have given up looking for work, meaning they’re dropping off the job seekers’ rolls. Take Fabrizio Augugliaro, 30, graduate of a five-year mechanical engineering program at the University of Palermo. His job? He plays the accordion on the street. In the tourist season, pumping the squeezebox might earn him €30 ($43) in coins over a couple of hours. “After I graduated, I looked for work – nothing,” he said while smoking and drinking coffee in central Palermo’s Piazza Bologni. “He who has work blocks work for the young. The mentality here is a job for life, so the older workers don’t want to risk bringing in younger competition for their jobs.” To be young in Sicily is to be without a job and living with your parents. The same goes for many other regions of the southern European Union, and more than a few parts of the ostensibly rich northern EU, such as de-industrialized northern France and middle England. Some 78 per cent of Italians aged 20-29 live with mamma and papa, according to recent figures from Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency. The live-at-home figure in Britain is half that, but still high by North American standards. They do so not because their mothers’ cooking is irresistible; it’s because they can’t afford rent. At the height of the European crisis, in 2011 and 2012, disaffected youth, most of them without jobs or recently forced out of jobs by the deadly combination of recession and austerity, turned central Athens into a gigantic bonfire on several occasions. Many other cities in Europe – Rome, Madrid, Barcelona and Paris, among them – were paralyzed by mass protests and strikes. This anger and tension have helped to fuel the rise of the populist parties, including France’s Front National, Germany’s Alternative fuer Deutschland and Movimento 5 Stelle (5 Star Movement, or M5S), which is Italy’s second-biggest national party and Europe’s biggest elected anti-establishment party. The Brexit and Donald Trump victories have emboldened the supporters and leaders of these parties, one or two of which could form governments as Europe embarks on a series of elections, including the French presidential vote in April. An October report by Mediobanca Securities analyst Antonio Guglielmi notes that nearly 50 per cent of voters in the 18-to-24 age group support M5S and that support for M5S among those age 54 or younger is 10 percentage points higher than it is for prime minister Matteo Renzi’s ruling Partito Democratico, the centre-left Democrats whose power base is older workers and pensioners. Italy is not so much divided by the traditional left-right political split as by age – wealthy oldsters versus the poor young. “The country is rather split in the young-versus-old-people dichotomy,” stated Mr. Guglielmi. “Older people have secured their benefits, jobs and pensions and tend to preserve the status quo, voting [for] pro establishment and traditional parties. Younger generations are sitting on large economic uncertainty …. It is not just an Italian situation.” Indeed, a July Foreign Affairs magazine article by UniCredit’s euro zone economist, Edoardo Campanella, said the young-old divide threatens to rip Europe apart. “As the young are pushed to the margins of society, Europe’s gerontocracy is becoming not only financially unsustainable but morally unbearable,” he wrote. “Striking a balance between the conflicting interests of the old and the young is therefore necessary to ward off explosive intergenerational tensions.” Italy, the euro zone’s third-largest economy, is on the front lines of the youth unemployment crisis. Sustained economic recovery in Western Europe, let alone in Italy, is unlikely unless the Italians get their youth off the sofa and into the work force. Italy, whose economy is still substantially larger than Canada’s, has been in recession or flat-lining since 2008. Italian youth unemployment is about 38 per cent, almost double the pre-crisis level, though down from its peak of about 43 per cent. The regional disparities are extreme. The rate in Bolzano, the wealthy mountain area in Italy’s far north, is only about 12 per cent, less than a third of the national rate and less than a quarter of the Sicilian rate. Italy’s southern regions, collectively known as the Mezzogiorno, could be on a different planet. Last year, the overall employment rate in Sicily – measured as the number of adults age 20 to 64 who were in the work force – was reported at only 42.4 per cent. That was the lowest in Europe, even worse than in perennial basket case Greece. It seems that every young adult in Sicily is unemployed, or underemployed. “I have a Sicilian friend who has a PhD in molecular biology and she does quality checks on food,” said Roberta di Mauro, 30, who has a biology degree from the University of Palermo. She fled Italy to find a job and surfaced in Brighton, England, where she works at the retailer Marks & Spencer. “I knew I had to leave or, at some point, I would be 35 and living at home.” Mariangela Salamone, 33, who has an industrial engineering degree from the same university, has bounced from one temporary job to another, all of them unrelated to her expertise and all poorly paid. Since Italy does not have a minimum wage, pay for unskilled or semi-skilled labour is often heinously low. She has not had work since last spring and says employment prospects for Italian mothers – she has a two-year-old son – are particularly grim. “The state does not pay for child care,” she said. “In Italy, the grandparents are the child-care system and if you don’t have willing grandparents who live close, you’re in trouble.” The saddest story of Sicilian unemployment belongs to Norman Zarcone, whose suicide in 2010 instantly made him the face of Italy’s lost youth generation. His death is still mourned in Palermo at public gatherings and in concerts dedicated to his memory. Mr. Zarcone was a musician and PhD student at the University of Palermo. His specialty was the philosophy of quantum mechanics. In an interview, his father Claudio, a freelance political journalist, said his son grew increasingly frustrated by the failure to find any research work in the philosophy department; nepotism and budget cuts conspired against him. On the morning of Sept. 13, 2010, he flung himself out of a window at the top of the university’s philosophy faculty. “He killed himself at the university, not at home, to deliver a message,” Claudio Zarcone said. “He became the symbol of the generation without work, who have no opportunities because of nepotism. They are called the ‘Norman generation.’” The tragedy is that the “Norman generation” is not limited to Sicily or even to southern Europe, where three countries – Greece, Portugal and Spain – sued for international bailouts during the height of the debt crisis (Spain’s bailout was directed at the banks) and Italy came close. Prospects for youth employment first started to deteriorate in the 1970s, as baby boomers flooded into the job market, greatly increasing the labour supply. At the same time, the wage gap between young and old workers began to widen. After 2008, when the Great Recession hit, youth employment went into crisis mode pretty much everywhere, though less so in Canada and the United States than in Europe. The youth jobless rates in the rich industrialized world in 2009, a year after the start of the crisis, climbed to shocking levels. France’s went to almost 23 per cent, Italy’s to 25 per cent, Spain’s to 37 per cent, Sweden’s to 25 per cent, Britain’s to 19 per cent and the United States’ to 17 per cent. For the 35 generally wealthy member states of the OECD, youth unemployment reached to 16.7 per cent in 2009, up from the pre-crisis level of 12 per cent. The good news is that youth unemployment in almost every European country is off its peak, dramatically so in a few countries, notably Ireland, Czech Republic, and Iceland, according to Eurostat. Germany has been the standout winner. Its youth unemployment has actually decreased since the crisis and now stands at only 7 per cent, thanks to fortunes thrown at vocational training, an aggressive economic stimulus program and an export boom, which was fuelled by the cheap euro and which offset relatively weak domestic demand. The bad news is that the decline in most countries has been modest, partly because the economic recovery itself has been underwhelming and young people, many of them on temporary contacts or no contracts at all, are easier to fire than the entrenched older workers. In Norway, which is under pressure from the oil price collapse, youth unemployment has actually edged up in recent years. In Spain, the rate has dropped 10 percentage points in two years, but at 43 per cent, is still solidly in crisis territory. France’s youth jobless rate was 24 per cent in 2014. The figure today is unchanged. No wonder the popularity ratings of President François Hollande are on a Titanic run, reaching 4 per cent in November, a record low for a president since the Second World War. David Bell, economics professor at Scotland’s University of Stirling, said countries where consumer demand has bounced back as their economies did the same, such as Ireland and Britain, have seen the greatest reductions in unemployment. A flexible labour market – the ability to hire and fire easily – helps. “Southern Europe does not have flexible labour markets,” he said. “Lack of demand in those countries was also made worse by austerity.” John Springford, director of research at the Centre for European Reform, a London think-tank, said countries that underwent painful internal devaluations – a wage-crunching exercise – have had better luck in reducing their jobless rates (Greece is the exception). In Britain, where overall unemployment hit an 11-year low of 4.8 per cent in October, real wages are down about 8 per cent since 2008. Real wages have not fallen in Italy, which helps to explain its terrible, post-crisis job-creation record and rapid de-industrialization. Youth unemployment’s pernicious factor is that the longer you’re out of a job, the chances of finding a job diminish. It also means that any job you do find can carry a wage penalty. This is called the “scarring effect” and it can trigger depression, ill health and even suicide. “There is a wealth of literature showing that unemployment is a stressful life event that directly reduces individual wellbeing,” Mr. Bell and David Blanchflower wrote in a 2011 report called Young People and the Great Recession. “Unemployment increases susceptibility to malnutrition, illness, mental stress and loss of self esteem, and increases the risk of depression.” There is no easy solution to the high levels of European youth unemployment, since each country is burdened by made-at-home conditions that can impede job creation. Greece is still gripped by austerity. Italy is hopelessly weighed down by excess bureaucracy and regulations, a dysfunctional judiciary that makes contract enforcement nearly impossible, and the Mafia’s influence in the south. France also suffers from deadening bureaucracy and has had enormous problems integrating its immigrant populations, in which unemployment is rife. Empty factories that will never be reopened litter northern Europe. Norway’s prime source of income – oil revenue – is in rapid decline. All hope is not lost. The European Central Bank’s €80-billion-a-month quantitative easing program is, finally, nudging up growth and inflation rates in the euro zone countries, suggesting that unemployment will not get worse. Austerity is in decline in some countries, such as Spain. But there is no guarantee that youth employment will return to normal. Mr. Springford, of the Centre for European Reform, said governments “should end austerity and make guarantees into training or government-subsidized jobs.” Governments are running out of time. The United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO) has drawn a direct line between social unrest and high unemployment; the memories of the riots and mass protests of 2011 and 2012, a few of them deadly, are still fresh. Recent images of unemployed youth in nearby Tunisia engaged in violent protests brought home the message again. The populist parties have expertly exploited the lack of opportunity among millions of young people. Beppe Grillo, the firebrand former comedian who leads Italy’s M5S, which is polling at 30 per cent, wants a referendum on the euro in good part because he thinks the currency is killing Italian jobs. He has Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi on the run. Ahead of Italy’s Dec. 4 referendum on constitutional reform, Mr. Renzi has been campaigning hardest in the job-free zones of the Italian south, where his support is crumbling while M5S’s surges. “Those who dare, the stubborn, the barbarians will carry the world forward, and we are the barbarians,” Mr. Grillo said, predicting that Mr. Renzi would lose the referendum and go on to lose the next election to M5S. In Sicily, young people seem to be losing hope that the job market will revive. Almost every day, there is news of another employer shutting down. Five years ago, Fiat (now Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), closed its Termini Imerese factory in Sicily, killing 1,600 jobs. For a while, call centres were coming on strong. “Sicily has 20,000 people in call centres, but now they’re closing and going to cheaper places such as Albania and Tunisia,” said Andrea Gattuso, the youth employment representative in Palermo for CGIL, the acronym for Italy’s biggest trade union. Adam Asmundo, chief economist for Fondazione RES, a Sicilian economic and civil research institute, says some smart young Sicilians are becoming entrepreneurial and launching tech companies but almost anyone with ambition is hitting the road. “The only thing they can do is get away, take a flight and go,” he said. “The problem is that the ones who flee are the most creative and dynamic.” In Palermo, Fabrizio Augugliaro, the engineer who became a musician, is making his peace with his freestyle life on the street, playing his accordion for tourists and picking up music-teaching gigs here and there. His rent and meals are cheap and stress levels are low, he says, even if he often finds his work tiresome. “We are of the generation whose parents told us to get a university degree and all our problems would be solved,” he said. “You know what? It wasn’t true.” Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/europes-youth-unemployment-crisis-stokes-generational-tensions/article33054509/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/europes-youth-unemployment-crisis-stokes-generational-tensions/article33054509/] The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers. Globe and Mail Update"
Europe's youth-jobs crisis stokes generational divide,Norway,"Italy is a Group of Seven industrialized country. You would not know that in Sicily, the host of the next G7 summit, in May. If it were a nation, you could be forgiven for thinking it's a failed state. The unemployment rate on the once-wealthy island is more than 22 per cent. Far more shocking is the youth unemployment, at 56 per cent. Additionally, many young adults have given up looking for work, meaning they're dropping off the job seekers' rolls. Take Fabrizio Augugliaro, 30, graduate of a five-year mechanical engineering program at the University of Palermo. His job? He plays the accordion on the street. In the tourist season, pumping the squeezebox might earn him 30 ($43) in coins over a couple of hours. “After I graduated, I looked for work – nothing,"" he said while smoking and drinking coffee in central Palermo's Piazza Bologni. “He who has work blocks work for the young. The mentality here is a job for life, so the older workers don't want to risk bringing in younger competition for their jobs."" To be young in Sicily is to be without a job and living with your parents. The same goes for many other regions of the southern European Union, and more than a few parts of the ostensibly rich northern EU, such as de-industrialized northern France and middle England. Some 78 per cent of Italians aged 20-29 live with mamma and papa, according to recent figures from Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency. The live-at-home figure in Britain is half that, but still high by North American standards. They do so not because their mothers' cooking is irresistible; it's because they can't afford rent. At the height of the European crisis, in 2011 and 2012, disaffected youth, most of them without jobs or recently forced out of jobs by the deadly combination of recession and austerity, turned central Athens into a gigantic bonfire on several occasions. Many other cities in Europe – Rome, Madrid, Barcelona and Paris, among them – were paralyzed by mass protests and strikes. This anger and tension have helped to fuel the rise of the populist parties, including France's Front National, Germany's Alternative fuer Deutschland and Movimento 5 Stelle (5 Star Movement, or M5S), which is Italy's second-biggest national party and Europe's biggest elected anti-establishment party. The Brexit and Donald Trump victories have emboldened the supporters and leaders of these parties, one or two of which could form governments as Europe embarks on a series of elections, including the French presidential vote in April. An October report by Mediobanca Securities analyst Antonio Guglielmi notes that nearly 50 per cent of voters in the 18-to-24 age group support M5S and that support for M5S among those age 54 or younger is 10 percentage points higher than it is for prime minister Matteo Renzi's ruling Partito Democratico, the centre-left Democrats whose power base is older workers and pensioners. Italy is not so much divided by the traditional left-right political split as by age – wealthy oldsters versus the poor young. “The country is rather split in the young-versus-old-people dichotomy,"" stated Mr. Guglielmi. “Older people have secured their benefits, jobs and pensions and tend to preserve the status quo, voting [for] pro-establishment and traditional parties. Younger generations are sitting on large economic uncertainty … It is not just an Italian situation."" Indeed, a July Foreign Affairs magazine article by UniCredit's euro zone economist, Edoardo Campanella, said the young-old divide threatens to rip Europe apart. “As the young are pushed to the margins of society, Europe's gerontocracy is becoming not only financially unsustainable but morally unbearable,"" he wrote. “Striking a balance between the conflicting interests of the old and the young is therefore necessary to ward off explosive intergenerational tensions."" Italy, the euro zone's thirdlargest economy, is on the front lines of the youth unemployment crisis. Sustained economic recovery in Western Europe, let alone in Italy, is unlikely unless the Italians get their youth off the sofa and into the work force. Italy, whose economy is still substantially larger than Canada's, has been in recession or flat-lining since 2008. Italian youth unemployment is about 38 per cent, almost double the pre-crisis level, though down from its peak of about 43 per cent. The regional disparities are extreme. The rate in Bolzano, the wealthy mountain area in Italy's far north, is only about 12 per cent, less than a third of the national rate and less than a quarter of the Sicilian rate. Italy's southern regions, collectively known as the Mezzogiorno, could be on a different planet. Last year, the overall employment rate in Sicily – measured as the number of adults age 20 to 64 who were in the work force – was reported at only 42.4 per cent. That was the lowest in Europe, even worse than in perennial basket case Greece. It seems that every young adult in Sicily is unemployed, or underemployed. “I have a Sicilian friend who has a PhD in molecular biology and she does quality checks on food,"" said Roberta di Mauro, 30, who has a biology degree from the University of Palermo. She fled Italy to find a job and surfaced in Brighton, England, where she works at the retailer Marks & Spencer. “I knew I had to leave or, at some point, I would be 35 and living at home."" Mariangela Salamone, 33, who has an industrial engineering degree from the same university, has bounced from one temporary job to another, all of them unrelated to her expertise and all poorly paid. Since Italy does not have a minimum wage, pay for unskilled or semiskilled labour is often heinously low. She has not had work since last spring and says employment prospects for Italian mothers – she has a two-year-old son – are particularly grim. “The state does not pay for child care,"" she said. “In Italy, the grandparents are the child-care system and if you don't have willing grandparents who live close, you're in trouble."" The saddest story of Sicilian unemployment belongs to Norman Zarcone, whose suicide in 2010 instantly made him the face of Italy's lost youth generation. His death is still mourned in Palermo at public gatherings and in concerts dedicated to his memory. Mr. Zarcone was a musician and PhD student at the University of Palermo. His specialty was the philosophy of quantum mechanics. In an interview, his father Claudio, a freelance political journalist, said his son grew increasingly frustrated by the failure to find any research work in the philosophy department; nepotism and budget cuts conspired against him. On the morning of Sept. 13, 2010, he flung himself out of a window at the top of the university's philosophy faculty. “He killed himself at the university, not at home, to deliver a message,"" Claudio Zarcone said. “He became the symbol of the generation without work, who have no opportunities because of nepotism. They are called the ‘Norman generation.' "" The tragedy is that the ""Norman generation"" is not limited to Sicily or even to southern Europe, where three countries – Greece, Portugal and Spain – sued for international bailouts during the height of the debt crisis (Spain's bailout was directed at the banks) and Italy came close. Prospects for youth employment first started to deteriorate in the 1970s, as baby boomers flooded into the job market, greatly increasing the labour supply.

Polar Bears’ Path to Decline Runs Through Alaskan Village,Norway,"Correction Appended KAKTOVIK, Alaska — Come fall, polar bears are everywhere around this Arctic village, dozing on sand spits, roughhousing in the shallows, padding down the beach with cubs in tow and attracting hundreds of tourists who travel long distances to see them. At night, the bears steal into town, making it dangerous to walk outside without a firearm or bear spray. They leave only reluctantly, chased off by the polar bear patrol with firecracker shells and spotlights. On the surface, these bears might not seem like members of a species facing possible extinction. Scientists have counted up to 80 at a time in or near Kaktovik; many look healthy and plump, especially in the early fall, when their presence overlaps with the Inupiat village’s whaling season. But the bears that come here are climate refugees, on land because the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is receding. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and the ice cover is retreating at a pace that even the climate scientists who predicted the decline find startling. Much of 2016 was warmer than normal[http://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card], and the freeze-up came late. In November, the extent of A[https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/] rctic sea ice[https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/] was lower than ever recorded for that month. Though the average rate of ice growth was faster than normal for the month, over five days in mid-November the ice cover lost more than 19,000 square miles, a decline that the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado called “almost unprecedented” for that time of year. In the southern Beaufort Sea, where Kaktovik’s 260 residents occupy one square mile on the northeast corner of Barter Island, sea ice loss has been especially precipitous. The continuing loss of sea ice does not bode well for polar bears, whose existence depends on an ice cover that is rapidly thinning and melting as the climate warms. As Steve Amstrup[http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/science/polar-bear-scientists/dr-steven-c-amstrup], chief scientist for Polar Bears International[http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/], a conservation organization, put it, “As the sea ice goes, so goes the polar bear.” An Imperfect Symbol The largest of the bear species and a powerful apex predator, the charismatic polar bear became the poster animal for climate change[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier]. Al Gore’s 2006 film, “An Inconvenient Truth,” which depicted a lone polar bear struggling in a virtually iceless Arctic sea, tied the bears to climate change in many people’s minds. And the federal government’s 2008 decision[https://www.fws.gov/alaska/fisheries/mmm/polarbear/pdf/Polar_Bear_Final_rule.pdf] to list polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act — a designation based in part on the future danger posed by a loss of sea ice — cemented the link. But even as the polar bear’s symbolic role has raised awareness, some scientists say it has also oversimplified the bears’ plight and unwittingly opened the door to attacks by climate denialists. “When you’re using it as a marketing tool and to bring in donations, there can be a tendency to lose the nuance in the message,” said Todd Atwood[https://alaska.usgs.gov/staff/staffbio.php?employeeid=601], a research wildlife biologist at the United States Geological Survey’s Alaska Science Center[https://alaska.usgs.gov/]. “And with polar bears in particular, I think the nuances are important.” Few scientists dispute that in the long run — barring definitive action by countries to curb global greenhouse gas emissions — polar bears are in trouble, and experts have predicted that the number will decrease with continued sea ice loss. A 2015 assessment[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22823/0#sectionAssessment] for the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List projected a reduction of over 30 percent in the number of polar bears by 2050, while noting that there was uncertainty about how extensive or rapid the decline of the bears — or the ice — would be. A version of the assessment was published online[http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/content/12/12/20160556] Dec. 7 in the journal Biology Letters. But the effect of climate change in the shorter term is less clear cut, and a populationwide decline is not yet apparent. Nineteen subpopulations of polar bears inhabit five countries that ring the Arctic Circle — Canada, the United States, Norway, Greenland and Russia. Of those, three populations, including the polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea, are falling in number. But six other populations are stable. One is increasing. And scientists have so little information about the remaining nine that they are unable to gauge their numbers or their health. In their analysis, the researchers who conducted the Red List assessment concluded that polar bears should remain listed as “vulnerable,” rather than be moved up to a more endangered category. Yet numbers aside, scientists are seeing other, more subtle indicators that the species is at increasing risk, including changes in the bears’ physical condition[http://www.nrcresearchpress.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/abs/10.1139/AS-2015-0027#.WEsAJrIrK71], body size[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/10.1890/08-1036.1/abstract], reproduction [https://alaska.usgs.gov/products/pubs/info.php?pubid=2452]and survival rates[http://www.sciencedirect.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/science/article/pii/S0048969716323221]. And scientists have linked some of these changes[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/10.2193/2006-180/abstract] to a loss of sea ice[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01603.x/abstract] and an increase in ice-free days in the areas where the bears live[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/10.1890/15-1256/abstract]. Climate-change denialists have seized on[https://polarbearscience.com/2016/11/01/if-experts-had-been-right-about-sea-ice-there-would-be-no-polar-bears-in-churchill/] the uncertainties in the science to argue that polar bears are doing fine and that sea ice loss does not pose a threat to their survival. But wildlife biologists say there is little question that the trend, for both sea ice and polar bears, is downward. The decline of a species, they note, is never a steady march to extinction. “It’s not going to happen in a smooth, linear way,” said Eric Regehr[http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/members/], a biologist at the federal Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage who took part in the 2015 assessment and presented the findings at a meeting in June of the International Union’s Polar Bear Specialist Group. From Sea to Shore A dozen polar bears pick through the bone pile that sits just outside town. Men from the whaling crews had dumped the carcass of a bowhead whale on the pile earlier in the day. As two visitors watch from the safety of a pickup truck a few hundred yards away, the bears devour the leftover meat and blubber. The Inupiat people, who have been whaling here for thousands of years, believe that a whale gives itself to the crew that captures it. Once the animal’s body is pulled to shore, water is poured over it to free its spirit. Even a few decades ago, most polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea remained on the ice year-round or, if they did come to shore, stopped only briefly. The sea ice gave them ready access to seals, the staple of their high-fat diet. But as the climate has warmed, the spring thaw has come earlier and the fall freeze later. The pack ice that was once visible from Kaktovik even in summertime has retreated hundreds of miles offshore, well beyond the southern Beaufort’s narrow continental shelf. The edge of the pack ice is now over deep water, where seals are few and far between and the distance to land is a long swim, even for a polar bear. As a result, researchers have found, a larger proportion of the bears in the southern Beaufort region are choosing to spend time on shore: an average of 20 percent compared with 6 percent two decades earlier, according to a recently published study[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155932] by Dr. Atwood of the Geological Survey and his colleagues that tracked female bears with radio collars. And the bears are staying on land longer — this year they arrived in August and stayed into November — remaining an average of 56 days compared with an average of 20 days two decades ago. “It’s one of two choices: Stay with the pack ice, or come to shore,” Dr. Atwood said of the southern Beaufort bears. “If they sit on that ice and those waters are very deep, it will be harder for them to find nutrition.” The shifts that researchers are seeing go beyond where polar bears decide to spend their summers. In the southern Beaufort Sea and in the western Hudson Bay — the two subpopulations studied the most by researchers — bears are going into the winter skinnier and in poorer condition. They are also smaller. And older and younger bears are less likely to survive than in the past. “You see it reflected through the whole population,” said Andrew Derocher, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta, who has studied polar bears for 32 years. “They just don’t grow as fast, and they don’t grow as big.” ‘An Urgency’ to Visit The proliferation of polar bears in Kaktovik in the fall has drawn wildlife photographers, journalists and climate-change tourists to the village, filling its two small hotels or flying in from Fairbanks for the day on chartered planes. About 1,200 people came to view the bears in 2015, and the number is increasing year by year, according to Robert [http://www.kaktovikarcticadventures.com/contact] Thompson[http://www.kaktovikarcticadventures.com/contact], an Inupiat guide who owns one of six boats that take tourists to view the bears. Some visitors are surprised at the bears’ darkened coats, dirty from rolling in sand and whale remains. “They don’t look like polar bears,” one man from the Netherlands said. “But it does not matter. I will Photoshop them when I get home.” Susan Trucano, who arrived in early September with her son, Matthew, said they wanted to see polar bears in the wild before they were driven to extinction. “It was an urgency to come here,” Ms. Trucano said. “My fear was that we would lose the opportunity of seeing these magnificent animals.” The increasing tourism has been a financial boon for some people in Kaktovik, but it has upset others. Tourists take up seats on the small commercial flights in and out of the village during the fall months when the bears are there, crowding out residents who need to fly to Anchorage or Fairbanks. And some visitors wander through town snapping pictures without asking permission, or get in the way of the rituals that accompany the whale hunt. Last year, an intrusive tourist nearly came to blows with one of the whaling captains. For the most part, polar bears and people have coexisted peacefully here. Village residents are tolerant of the bears — “They could break right in here, but they know the rules,” said Merlyn Traynor, a proprietor of the Waldo Arms Hotel[http://waldoarmshotel.com//] — and with the whale remains, they have little reason to come after humans. But as the Arctic ice continues to shrink, bears are arriving in poorer condition and are staying longer, even as the number of tourists increases. Interaction between bears and humans is becoming more common, as it has in other parts of the Arctic[http://www.globalnews.ca/news/3129915/record-number-of-polar-bear-clashes-in-churchill/], exposing the polar bears to more stress and the people to more danger. So far, there have been no attacks on humans, but there have been some close calls. “They never used to come into town, or maybe occasionally, like once a year or so,” Mr. Thompson said. “Now they’re in town every night.” Polar bear experts say they worry that at some point the number of bears seeking food here will exceed what is available. “When polar bears are fat and happy and in good condition, they’re not that big of a threat,” said James Wilder, an expert who recently completed a study of polar bear attacks on humans. “But when they get skinny and nutritionally stressed, you’ve got to watch out.” A Habitat Endangered Threatened species like lions or wolves face predictable threats: poaching and hunting, or the encroachment of human settlements on their habitat. But the biggest threat to the polar bear is something no regulatory authority involved in wildlife conservation can address: the unregulated release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Sport hunting once posed a significant danger to polar bears, greatly shrinking their numbers in some areas until 1973, when an agreement[http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/agreements/agreement1973.html] among the Arctic countries restricted hunting to members of indigenous groups, and the populations began to rebound. Oil spills[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/o/oil_spills/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier], pollution and over-hunting still pose some risk. But these dangers pale compared with the loss of sea ice. For many researchers, the most pressing question is how many days a polar bear can survive on land without the steady source of high-fat nutrition that seals usually provide. “A bear needs sea ice in order to kill seals and be a polar bear,” said Dr. Regehr of the Fish and Wildlife Service. “That’s a bottom line.” Some scientists have suggested that the bears might learn to survive on other types of food — snow geese, for example — or that they might learn to catch seals in the water, without relying on the ice as a platform. But most researchers say that is unlikely. Such changes usually evolve over thousands of years, said David Douglas[https://alaska.usgs.gov/staff/staffbio.php?employeeid=135], a research wildlife biologist at the Geological Survey, who spoke at the specialists group meeting. But the loss of sea ice “is taking place over potentially a very rapid time frame, where there may not be a lot of time in polar bear generations to home in on behaviors that could give some advantage,” he said. Much depends on how much of the ice disappears. Under some climate models, if steps are taken to control greenhouse gas emissions, the species could recover. And some evidence suggests that during an earlier warming period polar bears took refuge in an archipelago in the Canadian Arctic. In Kaktovik, at least for now, whales are providing the bears with an alternative source of food. But dead whale is not a polar bear’s preferred cuisine. “The bears are not here because we hunt whales,” said Mr. Thompson. “They’re here because their habitat has gone away, and it’s several hundred miles of open water out there.” Like the Science Times page on Facebook.[http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h] | Sign up for the  Science Times newsletter.[http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU] Correction: December 19, 2016, Monday An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to polar bears in one instance.

Refugees From an Arctic Thaw,Norway,"KAKTOVIK, Alaska -- Come fall, polar bears are everywhere around this Arctic village, dozing on sand spits, roughhousing in the shallows, padding down the beach with cubs in tow and attracting hundreds of tourists who travel long distances to see them. At night, the bears steal into town, making it dangerous to walk outside without a firearm or bear spray. They leave only reluctantly, chased off by the polar bear patrol with firecracker shells and spotlights. On the surface, these bears might not seem like members of a species facing possible extinction. Scientists have counted up to 80 at a time in or near Kaktovik; many look healthy and plump, especially in the early fall, when their presence overlaps with the Inupiat village's whaling season. But the bears that come here are climate refugees, on land because the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is receding. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and the ice cover is retreating at a pace that even the climate scientists who predicted the decline find startling. Much of 2016 was warmer than normal, and the freeze-up came late. In November, the extent of Arctic sea ice was lower than ever recorded for that month. Though the average rate of ice growth was faster than normal for the month, over five days in mid-November the ice cover lost more than 19,000 square miles, a decline that the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado called ''almost unprecedented'' for that time of year. In the southern Beaufort Sea, where Kaktovik's 260 residents occupy one square mile on the northeast corner of Barter Island, sea ice loss has been especially precipitous. The continuing loss of sea ice does not bode well for polar bears, whose existence depends on an ice cover that is rapidly thinning and melting as the climate warms. As Steve Amstrup, chief scientist for Polar Bears International, a conservation organization, put it, ''As the sea ice goes, so goes the polar bear.'' An Imperfect Symbol The largest of the bear subspecies and a powerful apex predator, the charismatic polar bear became the poster animal for climate change. Al Gore's 2006 film, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' which depicted a lone polar bear struggling in a virtually iceless Arctic sea, tied the bears to climate change in many people's minds. And the federal government's 2008 decision to list polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act -- a designation based in part on the future danger posed by a loss of sea ice -- cemented the link. But even as the polar bear's symbolic role has raised awareness, some scientists say it has also oversimplified the bears' plight and unwittingly opened the door to attacks by climate denialists. ''When you're using it as a marketing tool and to bring in donations, there can be a tendency to lose the nuance in the message,'' said Todd Atwood, a research wildlife biologist at the United States Geological Survey's Alaska Science Center. ''And with polar bears in particular, I think the nuances are important.'' Few scientists dispute that in the long run -- barring definitive action by countries to curb global greenhouse gas emissions -- polar bears are in trouble, and experts have predicted that the number will decrease with continued sea ice loss. A 2015 assessment for the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List projected a reduction of over 30 percent in the number of polar bears by 2050, while noting that there was uncertainty about how extensive or rapid the decline of the bears -- or the ice -- would be. A version of the assessment was published online Dec. 7 in the journal Biology Letters. But the effect of climate change in the shorter term is less clear cut, and a populationwide decline is not yet apparent. Nineteen subpopulations of polar bears inhabit five countries that ring the Arctic Circle -- Canada, the United States, Norway, Greenland and Russia. Of those, three populations, including the polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea, are falling in number. But six other populations are stable. One is increasing. And scientists have so little information about the remaining nine that they are unable to gauge their numbers or their health. In their analysis, the researchers who conducted the Red List assessment concluded that polar bears should remain listed as ''vulnerable,'' rather than be moved up to a more endangered category. Yet numbers aside, scientists are seeing other, more subtle indicators that the species is at increasing risk, including changes in the bears' physical condition, body size, reproduction and survival rates. And scientists have linked some of these changes to a loss of sea ice and an increase in ice-free days in the areas where the bears live. Climate-change denialists have seized on the uncertainties in the science to argue that polar bears are doing fine and that sea ice loss does not pose a threat to their survival. But wildlife biologists say there is little question that the trend, for both sea ice and polar bears, is downward. The decline of a species, they note, is never a steady march to extinction. ''It's not going to happen in a smooth, linear way,'' said Eric Regehr, a biologist at the federal Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage who took part in the 2015 assessment and presented the findings at a meeting in June of the International Union's Polar Bear Specialist Group. From Sea to Shore A dozen polar bears pick through the bone pile that sits just outside town. Men from the whaling crews had dumped the carcass of a bowhead whale on the pile earlier in the day. As two visitors watch from the safety of a pickup truck a few hundred yards away, the bears devour the leftover meat and blubber. The Inupiat people, who have been whaling here for thousands of years, believe that a whale gives itself to the crew that captures it. Once the animal's body is pulled to shore, water is poured over it to free its spirit. Even a few decades ago, most polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea remained on the ice year-round or, if they did come to shore, stopped only briefly. The sea ice gave them ready access to seals, the staple of their high-fat diet. But as the climate has warmed, the spring thaw has come earlier and the fall freeze later. The pack ice that was once visible from Kaktovik even in summertime has retreated hundreds of miles offshore, well beyond the southern Beaufort's narrow continental shelf. The edge of the pack ice is now over deep water, where seals are few and far between and the distance to land is a long swim, even for a polar bear. As a result, researchers have found, a larger proportion of the bears in the southern Beaufort region are choosing to spend time on shore: an average of 20 percent compared with 6 percent two decades earlier, according to a recently published study by Dr. Atwood of the Geological Survey and his colleagues that tracked female bears with radio collars. And the bears are staying on land longer -- this year they arrived in August and stayed into November -- remaining an average of 56 days compared with an average of 20 days two decades ago. ''It's one of two choices: Stay with the pack ice, or come to shore,'' Dr. Atwood said of the southern Beaufort bears. ''If they sit on that ice and those waters are very deep, it will be harder for them to find nutrition.'' The shifts that researchers are seeing go beyond where polar bears decide to spend their summers. In the southern Beaufort Sea and in the western Hudson Bay -- the two subpopulations studied the most by researchers -- bears are going into the winter skinnier and in poorer condition. They are also smaller. And older and younger bears are less likely to survive than in the past. ''You see it reflected through the whole population,'' said Andrew Derocher, a professor of biological sciences at the University of Alberta, who has studied polar bears for 32 years. ''They just don't grow as fast, and they don't grow as big.'' 'An Urgency' to Visit The proliferation of polar bears in Kaktovik in the fall has drawn wildlife photographers, journalists and climate-change tourists to the village, filling its two small hotels or flying in from Fairbanks for the day on chartered planes. About 1,200 people came to view the bears in 2015, and the number is increasing year by year, according to Robert Thompson, an Inupiat guide who owns one of six boats that take tourists to view the bears. Some visitors are surprised at the bears' darkened coats, dirty from rolling in sand and whale remains. ''They don't look like polar bears,'' one man from the Netherlands said. ''But it does not matter. I will Photoshop them when I get home.'' Susan Trucano, who arrived in early September with her son, Matthew, said they wanted to see polar bears in the wild before they were driven to extinction. ''It was an urgency to come here,'' Ms. Trucano said. ''My fear was that we would lose the opportunity of seeing these magnificent animals.'' The increasing tourism has been a financial boon for some people in Kaktovik, but it has upset others. Tourists take up seats on the small commercial flights in and out of the village during the fall months when the bears are there, crowding out residents who need to fly to Anchorage or Fairbanks. And some visitors wander through town snapping pictures without asking permission, or get in the way of the rituals that accompany the whale hunt. Last year, an intrusive tourist nearly came to blows with one of the whaling captains. For the most part, polar bears and people have coexisted peacefully here. Village residents are tolerant of the bears -- ''They could break right in here, but they know the rules,'' said Merlyn Traynor, a proprietor of the Waldo Arms Hotel -- and with the whale remains, they have little reason to come after humans.

Why cutting soot emissions is 'fastest solution' to slowing Arctic ice melt,Norway,"Reducing wood-burning, gas-flaring and global diesel emissions would be ‘quick win’ in combating irreversible climate change, scientists say World leaders should redouble efforts to cut soot emissions because it is the cheapest and fastest way to combat climate change, climate scientists and advocates have told the Guardian. Deposits of soot – unburned carbon particles – have stained parts of the Arctic black, changing the ice from a reflector of sunlight to an absorber of heat, and accelerating the melting of ice and snow, which itself is starting to alter global weather patterns[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now]. Related: Arctic ice melt 'already affecting weather patterns where you live right now'[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now] Some scientists believe reducing the concentration of soot particles and other so-called “short-lived climate pollutants” entering the atmosphere may be easier in the short term than bringing down carbon dioxide emissions. Such a “quick win” would be important to provide breathing space while world populations reduce their use of fossil fuels, scientists say. Paul Bledsoe, a former White House adviser who has worked on climate science issues for a decade, said: “Limiting short-lived climate pollutants is the cheapest, fastest way to prevent ice melt globally, particularly in the Arctic.” Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “You can’t solve a fast-moving problem like Arctic warming without fast-moving solutions. Cutting the short lived-climate pollutants is the fastest solution we’ve got. “Cutting these super climate pollutants can cut Arctic warming by two-thirds in the near term.” The vast expanse of ice and snow covering the Arctic may look startlingly white from a distance, but on closer examination the glaciers and snow cover are patched by dark streaks of inky black and dusty grey and brown. Some are small and self-contained; others are miles long. All are the mark of man. Hailong Wang, an atmospheric scientist at the US Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, said that both observational and modelling evidence showed that soot was warming the Arctic. “The warming effect could be through the direct heating to the air, snow and sea ice by absorbing sunlight, and then accelerating the melting of snow and sea ice,” Wang said. “When the melting starts, there are positive feedback processes that can lead to even faster melting.” Work by Piers Forster, a professor of physical climate change at the University of Leeds, and Maria Sands, a researcher at Norway’s Cicero institute, and their colleagues, has established that reducing soot emissions could lower Arctic temperatures by 0.2C within a few decades – a valuable contribution, considering that the commitment made in the Paris agreement was to hold temperature rises to no more than 1.5C or 2C. Related: Greenland's dark snow - in pictures[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/dec/08/greenlands-dark-snow-in-pictures] The Arctic bears what could be considered more than its fair share of the world’s pollution. Industry and tourism in the region are tiny, though mining and oil companies continue to eye-up potential sites as the permafrost retreats. The dirt that scars the Arctic landscape is not local: rather, ocean and air currents carry substances – soot, heavy metals, plastic particles, and more – fromacross the globe to deposit them in this pristine environment. Chemical pollution has even been found to cause brain damage in polar bears. Soot in the atmosphere has been calculated to be capable of causing warming of about 0.5C in the Arctic, from heating of the atmosphere and melting of snow. This amounts to about a quarter of the observed warming since pre-industrial times. However, the picture is more complicated than these raw figures might suggest. Unburned carbon particles and gases, such as sulphur dioxide, which often accompany soot production, can have an aerosol cooling effect, because in the atmosphere they can deflect heat from the sun back into space. This process, sometimes called global dimming, makes it hard to estimate the final effects of the pollution. While mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) and other pollutants persist for decades, soot is a less permanent problem. “Unlike greenhouse gases, soot particles are relatively short-lived in the atmosphere. The average lifetime is around a week or two,” says Wang. “New snowfall [can also] cover them [the soot particles] pretty quickly.” And this, according to Zaelke, is what makes soot so important. “Speed is the key metric here, that we haven’t paid enough attention to [in discussions over climate change],” he said. “We have been looking at slow-moving solutions [such as reducing greenhouse gases] and we need to catch up. We need to do something about near-term warming if we are going to stabilise the climate.” Greenhouse gases are produced by a wide range of human industries: generating electricity, driving, flying, raising cattle, making cement, agricultural fertilisers, and many more. Soot comes from a smaller subset of these activities. Coal-fired power stations are a leading source, as are dirty vehicle engines, and industrial chimneys, but even in developing countries where people have little access to electricity and powered transport, soot is produced by indoor fires used for cooking and heating. Global warming is not the only impact. Soot is behind human health problems from Beijing to Burundi, as the particles are breathed into lungs where they remain, causing and exacerbating respiratory diseases. Smoky fuels kill more than 4 million people a year, according to the World Health Organisation[http://www.who.int.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/] – a disproportionate number of them women and children, from dirty cooking fires. Dealing with soot, therefore, is not only a win for the climate, but for people’s health. Forster and Sand have identified three measures as potentially the most effective: reducing the domestic burning of wood in Asia, cutting the flaring of gas in Russia, and reducing emissions from diesel vehicles globally. The technology to do all of these is available. Gas flaring is not only unnecessary but inefficient, as captured waste gases can be used for fuel. Scrubbers can also be fitted to the chimneys of fossil fuel power stations. Car engines can be fitted with filters, as they are in many developed countries, to remove the dirt from exhausts. Cooking fires are individually harder to reach, but in many areas of the world simple solar cookers could be used that would not only reduce deaths from pollution but ease the lives of women and girls for whom the drudgery of finding fuel each day can be physically demanding, and put a brake on education and development. History shows that while these measures can involve some upfront costs, these are quickly repaid in quality of life. Londoners, for example, took pea-soupers as a fact of life before clean air legislation was passed following the deadly smogs of the early 1950s. With the right regulation and political will, soot could be made a historical curiosity across the globe. Forster said: “The measures [to reduce soot] would also help by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. They would also kick in faster – within 10 years of the emissions reduction – whereas CO2 emissions reductions just slow the rate of warming. You need negative [CO2] emissions for a CO2 cooling effect.” Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said: “With scientists recognising that soot ranks second only behind carbon dioxide in terms of global warming, it’s crucial that this pollution is cut to help avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Tackling soot would be a win-win, because it will bring enormous health benefits by cutting air pollution too. Governments must act now, and act fast.” These actions will only be effective as part of a broader push to tackle carbon emissions. Although dealing with soot could be an important way of heading off one of the threats to the Arctic and the world, it cannot be a substitute for acting on warming gases more widely. “Greenhouse gases are still the major player in causing the overall melting of the Arctic,” said Wang. Stopping soot pollution could give us a vital breathing space, but an effective end to global warming – and Arctic melting – will require much more."
"Behind oil-drilling bans, a debate over competing Arctic visions",Norway,"The days of the Arctic being a remote and frozen wilderness appear to be coming to an end, but precisely what the rapidly changing region will develop into is only just beginning to be addressed. Two competing visions for the region clashed this week when President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced new restrictions on offshore drilling in their respective jurisdictions of the Arctic Ocean. In the eyes of these two progressive-minded leaders – one cementing his environmental legacy on the way out the door, the other beginning to establish his – the melting Arctic represents an opportunity to develop the increasingly accessible region in a cleaner and more diverse and sustainable fashion that protects its fragile ecosystems while helping the two countries reduce their carbon emissions. On the other side, critics say the new restrictions will simply boost fossil fuel development in other Arctic regions, namely in Russian and Norwegian territory, while forcing Arctic communities to abandon industries that have, literally and financially, fueled their development to date. The restrictions on drilling could see the countries follow in the footsteps of other Arctic nations that have moved away from oil and gas toward the tourism and shipping industries, according to Mia Bennett, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is researching Arctic development. “Outside of Norway and Russia, there has already been a shift away from developing infrastructure for [oil and gas] in the Arctic and a move towards building maritime infrastructure, namely for the cruise and shipping industries,” she says by email. The new limits on Arctic drilling are potentially indefinite in the US, but will be reviewed every five years in Canada. Tourism rising Even prior to this week’s announcement, the fossil fuel industry in the North American Arctic was slumping while tourism has been enjoying slow but steady growth. Low oil prices combined with the hazardous conditions have made Arctic oil exploration a financial nonstarter for companies for now. Royal Dutch Shell, perhaps the most aggressive company in the region, has sunk over £5 million in Arctic fuel exploration with no meaningful return. The thawing of the Northwest Passage, meanwhile, has enabled the slow-but-steady growth of the tourism industry. The Passage’s southern route has been navigable every summer since 2007, while the northern route has been navigable for six summers since then. Cruise ships have been making increasingly lengthy transits, beginning in 2011 and culminating this past summer in the first larger-size cruise ship, the Crystal Serenity, traversing the entire passage. The industry is still in its infancy, however, and far from accessible to the typical traveler. Tickets for the Crystal Serenity ranged from $22,000 to $120,000, plus required insurance coverage costing $50,000. And the shipping industry still has some way to go. Ships have managed fewer than 240 complete transits of the Northwest Passage since Roald Amundsen first did it 110 years ago, and without oil and gas development there may be precious little for ships to transport in and out anyway. “The shipping industry's bread and butter is transporting resources out of the Arctic and importing in supplies for extraction (including oil and gas),” writes Ms. Bennett. “Without the latter, I'm not sure how lucrative the former will be.” Indeed, the fossil fuel industry has long sustained Arctic communities by providing jobs, resources, and infrastructure to places few other industries are willing to go. And this was among the arguments made by critics of the new restrictions. Decision 'will inhibit our ... communities' “This decision will not stop our climate from changing, but it will inhibit our North Slope communities from developing the infrastructure, communications capability and technology necessary for growth,"" said Rex Rock, Sr., president of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, according to KTUU News in Alaska. ""It’s a move which was made without any consultation from the largest private land owners in the U.S. Arctic and yet we will be the ones forced to live with the consequences.” Despite the lack of exploration activity in the region, some politicians in both countries bemoaned the potential lost revenue, which they believe will be soon captured by competing nations like Norway and Russia. “The Arctic is going to be developed. We know that,” said Sen. David Sullivan (R) of Alaska, according to KTUU. “So now what we’re going to see is companies taking their resources and their capital to countries that don’t have the high standards that we do.” Bob McLeod, premier of the Northwest Territories, criticized Mr. Trudeau for leaving untapped 7 billion barrels of oil and 92 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in a territory that has the third-lowest per-capita GDP in the country. “The Russian Arctic is already the frontier of Arctic [oil and gas] exploration, and now with these restrictions, it looks poised to remain that way,” writes Bennett. “A frontier, sacrifice zone, or vulnerable testing ground, depending on how you look at it.” For now at least, the North American Arctic will take a slightly different path. A different kind of power Clean-energy technology is beginning to enter the conversation, with companies interested in taking advantage of the region’s immense hydropower potential. One company, Ocean Renewable Power Company of Portland, Maine, has been testing small-scale tidal and river power generators in remote Alaskan villages, training locals to install and operate the systems. “These communities have the potential to grow,” says Chris Sauer, the company’s president and CEO. “Being able to provide them with affordable energy that doesn’t damage the environment could be a huge catalyst in the growth of these communities.” Meanwhile, tourists can arrive by air as well as ship. And more development is coming by land, name in the form of a $300-million, 150-kilometer highway being built between Inuvik in the Northwest Territories and the Arctic coastal town of Tuktoyaktuk. While the road may bring more development, particularly tourism, Bennett is concerned that projects like this – which may only have a 40- or 50-year lifespan – will become more common. “I think there’s a general unwillingness to think about longer-term development past, say, 2050,” she says. “We have at this moment in the Arctic a strong desire to put in infrastructure and money and investment, but the future landscape is becoming harder and harder to predict.”"
Loganair chief makes a flying start as airline plans to take off,Norway,"THERE is a pause followed by muted laughter when Jonathan Hinkles is asked why he took on the role of managing director at “beleaguered” Scottish airline Loganair. Beset by operational and punctuality issues, profits were falling and the First Minister had publicly revealed her concerns over Loganair’s ability to service its passengers in remote Scottish communities. “I was aware of where things were,” says Mr Hinkles – who moved from his role as vice-president operations and crewing at Virgin Atlantic at the end of June. “Early this year I was asked if I would like to participate in the selection process. I was fairly non-committal, but it moved from there.” Mr Hinkles had previously served as chief operating officer at Loganair, before moving to Virgin for four years. “I like Virgin, I like the people, but the point I’m making is that at Loganair there was clearly a job to do, and it’s an operation I knew could and should work well, and I enjoyed very much in my previous time at the airline,” he says. “There was a defined ability to make a very visible difference and get the airline to where it needed to be.” Less than six months later and things are markedly improving. Punctuality – flights landing within 15 minutes of their scheduled slot – was at 89 per cent in October, 20 percentage points ahead of last year. This had been made possible by beginning to overcome a shortage of skilled aviation engineers, and rebuilding shaken confidence among the 600-strong workforce. “There was a lot of work to do to build confidence,” says Mr Hinkles. “It was a two-point challenge, one of which is customer confidence in the airline and its service delivery after a pretty torrid run of operational issues, and the second is about rebuilding the confidence in our team that they have the capacity to deliver.” He called the last year of media coverage, “pretty demoralising,” saying: “It went from being ‘Loganair, Scotland’s airline’, to ‘beleaguered airline, Loganair’.” Then, just as plans were progressing smoothly, the airline opted not to sign a franchise extension with Flybe, with whom it has operated under since 2007. “The working assumption all the way through [talks] was that we would renew the franchise if the terms on the table to do so were acceptable,” he says. “They weren’t and we didn’t.” And so Loganair heads into 2017 ready to fly under its own banner for the first time since it signed a franchise deal with BA in 1993. “The more we looked at the option of going independent the more we were attracted by what we saw,” says Mr Hinkles. A new schedule has been unveiled that Mr Hinkles said was a “statement of intent” as Loganair prepared for a new chapter in its long history. In addition to retaining services previously operated under the franchise agreement, new routes have been launched, including Stornoway to Manchester, and Shetland and Aberdeen to Vagar in Faroe Islands. A twice-weekly service from Glasgow to Bergen in Norway will also launch. “Where the exchange rate has gone after Brexit, which frankly is another big challenge that airlines face today, it should be good news for incoming tourism – shopping, eating, drinking trips will prove pretty popular out of Norway into Glasgow,” he says. Revenue at the business for the year ending March 31 was £95.3 million as pre-tax profits halved to £3.6m. Mr Hinkles says revenue will pass £100m this year as new commercial contracts supplement its consumer offer. These already include services for oil and gas companies, and Royal Mail. An education campaign to highlight that Loganair will be flying independently from September 1 will begin in earnest towards the end of March, while a number of new staff will be hired in Glasgow to take over back office duties that were carried out previously by Flybe. A £15m investment plan is under way and in addition to increasing the 28-strong fleet, aircraft will begin to be replaced, but not until around five years from now. “A lot of talk about new aircraft came up when the issues were happening last year and became conflated, wrongly,” he says. “The issues last year were around the loss of personnel to support the fleet and organisational elements that we have put fixes in place to resolve. It does not automatically follow that old airplane means unreliable and new airplane means good.” That team of engineers is “broadly back to full strength”, he says. But adds: “It takes a tremendous amount of time to train an engineer on a specific type of airplane. The lead time is a minimum of six months but more realistically it takes 18 months to train an experienced engineer in all the functions of a different aircraft.” Mr Hinkles says he is “genuinely pleased” with where the airline is today. The improvements in reliability would indicate that Loganair is getting where it needs to be, which has allowed him to look at the macro challenges impacting the industry. “We’ve got a number of new contracts, which will help profitability and the same time we have got the issue of foreign exchange and Brexit. All of our fuel, maintenance, spare parts are paid for in dollars and have just become more expensive. “It is never going to be plain sailing, or plain flying I should say, but we have got to keep running it as well as we can and operational performance is the best way to do that. The most cost-effective way to run an airline is on time.” Mr Hinkles concedes Virgin’s routes may have had a touch more glamour, but that Orkney is his favourite Loganair destination. A good day is a trip to Kirkwall for meetings (where he recently bid to take the airline’s service in the islands past the 50-year mark) before joining the flight crew on the inter-island services. For a boy of eight who became fascinated with aircraft, it sounds like a fitting way to spend his career. “[The other] Monday I took the evening flight to North Ronaldsay and we delivered five passengers and picked up a couple to bring back, which is what we do up there. It’s just great.”"
