Fire and ice; The potential proving ground for hydrogen technology has shifted from Iceland to Hawaii,Iceland,"Experts have long believed that, at least for the foreseeable future, the ideal early market for hydrogen fuel-cell cars is a small, self-contained place, one facing exorbitant fossil fuel prices and with an abundant supply of renewable energy on tap. That would be Iceland. At one time, before the financial crisis essentially bankrupted the country, Iceland had said it planned to be the world's first hydrogen economy. Times have changed. Aside from needing to focus on bailing out its bankrupt banks, Iceland also found itself face to face with another big challenge: access to fuel-cell cars. There are only a handful of them and one in mass production. This brings us to the Hawaiian Island of Oahu, with a population of one million. Last year, General Motors announced the Hawaii Hydrogen Initiative (or H2I in marketing speak) in Honolulu. This new partnership includes Aloha Petroleum (which operates filling stations), The Gas Company (which produces large amounts of hydrogen as a byproduct of making the synthetic natural gas it sells), the U.S. Energy Department, the Hawaiian Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, and the American military. The partners envision a hydrogen renewable energy future for Hawaii. The goal is to have 20 to 25 hydrogen stations operating on Oahu by 2015, the year that commercial fuel-cell vehicle production is expected to start in limited quantities. GM predicts that the small network of H2 stations on Oahu could power 10,000 cars and service every driver without fear of running out of H2. Meanwhile, GM has built more than 100 hydrogen-powered Chevrolet Equinoxes, almost all in Oshawa, Ont. GM is mum on pricing, but Toyota told just-auto.com that at current costs, the hydrogen car it planned to deliver by 2015 or earlier would take about $120,000 (U.S.) to build. GM, Daimler, Toyota and Honda all believe fuel cells have a future. The biggest barrier to adoption of hydrogen as the fuel of the future is not the vehicle technology, but the lack of a network of hydrogen filling stations. Oahu is a test case for what's possible. ******* Promise of Hydrogen Why keep living the hydrogen fuel cell dream? Auto makers favour fuel cells for two main reasons: no need for petroleum and no emissions from the tailpipe. A fuel cell uses hydrogen to generate electricity through a chemical reaction and emits only water vapour through the tailpipe. Hydrogen is plentiful and can be derived from natural gas, methanol and even water. Compared to other so-called “green” transportation technologies – gas-electric hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery-powered vehicles – hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles could be a promising way for car companies to meet stiffer CO2 regulations later this decade. So what's in a fuel-cell powertrain? Four main elements: 1. A tank that stores hydrogen. 2. A fuel-cell stack that converts hydrogen and oxygen into heat and water, creating electricity. 3. Lithium-ion batteries that store the electricity. 4. A power unit that controls the flow of electricity to the electric motors that propel the vehicle. Unlike a battery-powered vehicle that can take six or more hours to recharge, a hydrogen refill takes 3.5 minutes. Battery-powered cars have a range of no more than 160 km, yet Honda's Clarity fuel-cell sedan can travel 400 km on hydrogen. Battery cars and hybrids aside, auto makers say electric vehicles powered by fuel cells compare well against internal combustion engines with catalytic converters. According to General Motors, fuel-cell-powered cars are more than twice as efficient as internal combustion vehicles. Moreover, fuel cell cars boast: Comparable precious-metal content Comparable durability Comparable range: about 400-500 km or more Comparable performance 60 per cent fewer parts 90 per cent fewer moving parts Zero emissions Zero petroleum needs Cold and hot weather capability Fast refuelling"
Heated seats in a frozen wonderland; A luxurious Porsche SUV takes the chill off a trip to the end of the highway at Prudhoe Bay,Iceland,"DEADHORSE, ALASKA -- DEADHORSE, ALASKA - The old guy loading supplies onto the snow machine's trailer nodded toward our cars and asked the inevitable question. ""I saw you down at the Safeway in Fairbanks. You're driving up to Prudhoe? Why do you want to do that?"" Because it's an adventure, we told him. Because it's the end of the Alaska road. Because it's as far north as anyone can drive in North America, farther even than Inuvik or Tuktoyaktuk in Canada. Because it's there. ""Okay,"" he said, and paused for a moment. ""But why do you want to do that?"" If anyone could understand, it should be this guy - a man intimately acquainted with the lure of the far north. We met him at a turn-off from the fabled Dalton Highway, just an hour's drive below the Arctic Circle. He was loading fresh fruit and vegetables onto the trailer to take to his roadless community 30 kilometres up the Yukon River. But he did not understand. He smiled, shook his head politely and returned to the task, and we walked back through the crisp April air to the four Porsche Cayennes with their heated seats, heated steering wheels and thick, contoured leather. If truth be told, none of us could really answer the question, either. I've been accompanying a group of nine Italians who love Porsches and cold places, and who flew into Vancouver late last month from their homes at Pesaro in balmy central Italy to make this drive. All own Porsche Cayenne SUVs and love them so much that they make annual winter excursions to challenging places: northern Scotland, Iceland, Norway's Nordkap. This month, after two years of preparation, they left Europe for this cold drive north to America's Arctic coast. Porsche Canada supplied the vehicles and some logistic help, and I'm tagging along for the ride. I've always wanted to drive to Prudhoe Bay. Not sure why. The convoy headed north through British Columbia and the Yukon before crossing into central Alaska and reaching Fairbanks Tuesday, where we stocked up on decent coffee and junk food. The Dalton Highway starts 135 km north of town and the road turns immediately to hard-packed gravel, perhaps to deter whimsical tourists. This is the Haul Road, not a sightseeing route but a supply highway to the oil field communities of Prudhoe Bay and Deadhorse, and a maintenance highway for the northern half of the 1,300 km Alaska pipeline. It doesn't take long for the pipeline to show itself, running raised above the ground and close to the road. Almost half is buried, whenever there's no danger of it warming the permafrost, and a dozen giant pumping stations along the way provide the pressure to keep the oil moving. There are mountains here, white and jagged against the blue sky, and the road twists and curves at their base. It's wide enough for two trucks to pass comfortably and the surface soon changes back to smooth asphalt. though with the occasional dip that keeps you awake. It's built mostly above the surface on a bed of raised gravel, partly to better drain itself as protection from frost heaves and to insulate the permafrost below, but also to provide a buffer that prevents snow from sweeping directly across the surface. It can snow here on any day of the year, and although it's such a dry climate that true storms are infrequent, what snow there is doesn't melt but just accumulates until late May. We pressed on north from the Yukon River and soon reached the Arctic Circle, where there's a turn-off and a large sign that thrilled the visitors. Most vacationers on this road visit from May to September and few will see the deep snow that blocks the washrooms and the picnic tables, but for us, the strong, windless sun felt almost warm and it was comfortable to read the information posters. The Italians unfurled a large sign to pose for photos, and then we drove north for another hour to our beds for the night. The beds were at Coldfoot, a former mining community that is the only public source for fuel and food along the 666 km of the road. After construction of the highway was completed in just the five summer months of 1974, and the pipeline was completed three years later, the workers' house trailers from a nearby camp were moved here and turned into lodging, alongside a restaurant and saloon; we stayed in comfortable prefabricated and connected rooms and chatted to truckers till late into the night. Those professional drivers couldn't understand the appeal of driving without getting paid for it, either, but they were angry with us that one of our party - another Canadian guest driving the Cayenne that towed the trailer - had been travelling too fast for their liking. At least twice, he'd not moved properly over to the side of the road to let them pass. We assured them that somebody else would be driving the trailer the next day. Just as well, they said - we'll run him off the road next time. And they were serious. You don't mess around up here. In fact, the next day brought the most challenging section of the drive by far, when we reached the 4,800-foot Atigun Pass - this is the Continental Divide and the highest highway pass in Alaska. If you watch Ice Road Truckers on TV, this is where much of the action takes place. The road has a 12 per cent grade and trucks must stop before the long climb to chain up their driving tires. The only way to get through is to take it slow and steady, and we followed a pair of heavy haulers that were themselves escorted by chase pickups to prepare the way. With four-wheel drive, Pirelli winter tires and hundreds of horsepower, we had a much easier time of it than those transport trucks. And on the other side, after dropping steeply onto the Arctic watershed, we saw the trees had disappeared and the temperature had dropped to -20 C. The guidebook warned that these last 275 km have the worst weather on the highway, which means the snow blows across the clear tundra and sweeps the road.High posts to each side mark the route for the plows and we stayed between those posts, with nothing now to see except flat white on each side, blurring into a white sky. The road here is hard-pack again, iced in the winter to protect it from the heavy tires and coated in the summer with calcium chloride to keep down the dust, which makes it both corrosive and slippery. But it's still worth it on the machinery if it means the trucks can complete the long haul to supply the oil fields at the ocean. For us, though - was it worth it? For tourists with no reason to visit except to look around and then return south? We pulled up to the town's solitary working gas pump this evening, where the price of unleaded wasn't even marked but sells for about $5 a U.S. gallon, and looked around to ask ourselves the same question. Was it worth it? We're still a couple of kilometres short of the Arctic Ocean here, and cannot pass the oilfield security gates to get to the frozen water. We went there and were turned back. There's nothing else to see at this time of year except prefab buildings and white expanse - the small lake and summer wildflowers are nothing but flat snow and ice. This truly is the end of the road. Soon, we'll return south and retrace our route down to Fairbanks, and then to Anchorage. But when we're home and we next look at the map, and our eyes trace that red line that slides to the top of the paper, or slips off the top of the screen, we'll nod and perhaps even smile. Another mystery will have been answered. Maybe not explained, but answered nonetheless. Mark Richardson is the editor of Wheels. mrichardson@thestar.ca.

Rising Oil and a Falling Dollar Reset Summer Travel Plans,Iceland,"Whether you're planning a hike through the Grand Canyon or a tour of Tuscany this summer, expect to pay more to get there and to spend the night. Rising oil prices are driving up the cost of airfares and gasoline at the pump. And a weaker dollar is making hotels and meals more expensive abroad. But travel experts say there are ways to trim summer travel costs. Book a package when possible to lock in prices, should oil prices keep rising and the dollar falling. Travel off the beaten path. And forget about waiting for those last-minute deals -- there aren't likely to be many. ""This is going to be a summer where the traveler has to do his or her homework,"" says Henry Harteveldt, an airline and travel analyst for Forrester Research in San Francisco. U.S. and Canada Thinking of taking that Great American Road Trip? Gas prices will eat into your budget. The Energy Information Administration recently projected gasoline prices will jump 40% this summer from last summer. Serena Treavor of Berkeley, Calif., nixed the idea of driving cross-country after determining it would cost her $800 for gas alone. Add food and lodging, and the tab would reach $1,500 one way, she estimates. So Ms. Treavor booked an all-inclusive cross-country package from Green Tortoise Adventure Travel, which covers food, transportation and lodging. She'll be riding and sleeping in a bus with custom couches and chairs for up to 36 passengers. Ms. Treavor is paying $1,000 one way from San Francisco to Boston or New York. And if she decides to fly back to San Francisco (about $400 one way), she'll be saving about $1,600. Booking a hotel in a nearby city, instead of a larger tourist destination, can save you a bundle. Thinking of Washington, D.C.? Consider staying in a hotel in Baltimore or Annapolis, Md., both about an hour away, says Clem Bason, president of Hotwire Group, which is owned by Expedia. A four-day stay at the Hilton in Washington, D.C., was recently going for $240 per room per night, compared with $119 at the Hilton in Annapolis, according to Hotels.com. Cut costs further by flying into airports a bit farther from your destination. For instance, round-trip flights between Chicago and Orlando on Southwest Airlines for late July were recently going for as low as $285. Flights from Chicago to Tampa Bay, a two-hour drive from Orlando, were as low as $110. A year after the BP oil spill, the cost of vacationing on the Gulf of Mexico is still down. A room in a resort near Sarasota, Fla., is going for $129 per night, down from $149 last March, according to Travelzoo.com. And Vancouver, British Columbia, is rife with deals, according to travel experts. Hotels were built and renovated for the 2010 Olympic Games. Tourism has trailed off since then, however, so vacancies are in abundance, says Mr. Bason, with four-star hotels at about $100 per night. Abroad Long-haul flights are expected to be even more affected by oil prices, with experts estimating a 20% jump in airfares by summer. Some carriers, including American Airlines and British Airways, already have added fuel surcharges as high as $200 on some flights. That means it's best to lock in prices early -- and consider a package that incorporates airfare, hotel, other transportation and even some meals. ""If you were to book à la carte...you would spend at least twice as much,"" says Angela Lyda, senior editor of travel-ticker.com, a site owned by Hotwire. In Europe, the best deals are outside popular destinations like England, Italy and France. So forgo the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum for St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague or the Gullfoss waterfall in Iceland. Vanessa Giacoppo, a 27-year-old publicist in New York, was planning to go to Paris or London with her boyfriend during Memorial Day weekend -- until they realized they'd have to dish out more than $1,000 each for airfare alone. So they're going to Iceland. The airfare cost $400 each. They're staying in hotels ranging from $50 to $275 per night. ""A lot of my friends are asking ""Where? Why? How? Isn't it going to be cold?'"" Ms. Giacoppo says. ""We'll see [Reykjavik]. Maybe a glacier. ... Paris wasn't within reach, but Iceland was."" Eastern European cities such as Budapest and Prague may have airfares comparable to their western neighbors, but hotels are much cheaper. Rooms (mostly three- and four-star bookings) are going for an average of $100 per night, says Jeanenne Tornatore, senior travel editor at Orbitz.com, compared with about $175 for London, Paris and Rome. Some countries' economic malaise may be to your financial benefit. Ireland and Greece have resorted to bailouts from the European Union to shore up their economies -- and Portugal is right behind them. So these countries are looking to capture your travel dollars, Forrester's Mr. Harteveldt says. A 10-day package to Greece was recently going for about $1,100, including airfare, hotels, and ferries, according to Ms. Lyda. In the Mideast, deals could start showing up for tourist spot Egypt. Carriers are just starting to reinstate flights to the country following the political unrest. And as flights pick up, discounts are expected to follow. Mr. Harteveldt expects hotels, sight-seeing operators and restaurants to lower prices to attract foreign travelers. Packages will likely be your cheapest and best option, he says, especially guided tours if you're concerned about safety. If your idea of a vacation is a beach and a lounge chair, summer months are hurricane season -- meaning it's cheaper -- in the Caribbean and Mexico. But expect to pay more than last summer, due to higher fares. Stick with an all-inclusive package for the best prices. It may seem like you're paying more upfront, but if you factor in activities, food and drink, you could save 50%, Ms. Lyda says. Cruises Home-port cruising, where you don't have to fly to a port, is the way to go. Airfare can be more expensive than a 10- to 12-night cruise, says Stewart Chiron, chief executive of travel-advice website CruiseGuy.com. In the New York area, cruises to Canada, New England, Bermuda, the Caribbean as well as trans-Atlantic destinations leave from Bayonne, N.J., Manhattan and Brooklyn. If you live in central Connecticut, for instance, you could drive about two hours to Bayonne to embark on a typical five-night cruise to Bermuda or the Caribbean (costing about $600 per person). You'll pay about $50 in gas round trip and $95 for parking. But if you were to fly to Miami and take a cruise from there, you'd spend about $400 on airfare and transportation and $500 on the cruise per person. The first option could be a big savings for, say, a family of four. Cruises to Florida, the Bahamas and the eastern Caribbean also depart from Baltimore. Cruises to the western Caribbean depart from Galveston, Texas, Mobile, Ala., and New Orleans. The most popular summertime cruise is Alaska, Mr. Chiron says. Leaving from Seattle, instead of the more common Vancouver, however, can save you about 30% on airfare. Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com[mailto:emily.glazer@wsj.com]"
Arctic countries seek cooperation as ice melts,Iceland,"Top diplomats from eight Arctic countries will meet Thursday to set down rules for opening the vast region to fishing, tourism, oil and mineral exploration as global warming melts the ice. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her colleagues from Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden will gather in Greenland's tiny capital of Nuuk to discuss how to manage the area's development while protecting its fragile ecosystem. With its capital of 16,000 people, Greenland will be represented by Denmark, which handles foreign affairs for the sprawling self-ruled territory of 65,000 inhabitants neighboring northeastern Canada. Heather Conley, an Arctic expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the gathering is historic, in part because it is the first time a US secretary of state will attend the ministerial talks. It ""is a historic turning point to deepen and strengthen international cooperation in the Arctic as we seek to meet the dramatic challenges of the equivalent of a melting continent over the next several decades,"" she said. Clinton's deputy Jim Steinberg said the seventh biennial ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council -- composed of the eight countries and the region's indigenous groups -- also marks another step away from the Cold War. ""We want to send a strong message that in the post-Cold War world the Arctic is a region of cooperation, not conflict,"" he told a gathering hosted by the CSIS think tank in Washington. ""By working together to ensure the safety of human life in a newly emerging region of human activity we can show in particular that Russia and the United States are key actors in helping to propel cooperation on core issues."" Clinton and her counterparts are due to sign an Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement, which the State Department said will be the first binding international agreement among the eight Arctic states. During talks in Iceland in December, the ministers drafted an agreement that divides the Arctic into specific search and rescue areas, with each nation legally responsible for its own territory. Icelandic officials said such an agreement was all the more important as an increasing number of people now sail through the Arctic as waterways open up with the melting ice. In August last year, a Russian oil tanker set off for China on a previously impassable route through the Arctic Ocean. Cruises with tourists are also venturing into the Arctic, particularly around the US state of Alaska. Earlier this month scientists said that warming in the Arctic is occurring at twice the global average and is on track to lift sea levels by up to 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) by 2100, a far steeper jump than predicted a few years ago. Steinberg said Washington wants the Nuuk talks to launch a task force designed to negotiate an instrument for handling Arctic oil spills. ""We know that there are significant deposits of oil and gas that were in the past difficult to access and may become more accessible over time,"" he said. The United States wants the Arctic countries to be prepared to both prevent oil spills or other disasters and to create ""effective mechanisms to deal with accidents should they happen,"" Steinberg said. More than one fifth of the world's undiscovered but technically recoverable reserves of hydrocarbons are located north of the Arctic Circle, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The region accounts for about 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas, USGS data shows. About 84 percent of the resources are offshore. Exploration off Greenland has yet to produce any commercially exploitable reserves, but that did not stop British firm Cairn from boosting its investment there by one billion dollars on the back of ""encouraging"" first results. Alaska, where the Prudhoe Bay oil field has been operating since 1977, is currently the most exploited area of the Arctic and its wells are responsible for more than one tenth of US oil production. Washington also sees the potential for new fisheries to emerge as the ice retreats, according to David Balton, the US deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries. The meeting in Nuuk aims to establish a permanent secretariat for the Arctic Council, with Iceland offering to host it in Reykjavik and Norway proposing its northern city of Tromso, Balton said. Clinton, who leaves for Nuuk on Wednesday, will be accompanied by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other officials, a testament to the importance Washington attaches to the meeting. Clinton and the ministers will gather for dinner Wednesday evening. lc/jk/ss"
Leaked cables show tension over Arctic: Greenpeace,Iceland,"A rush for the Arctic's resources is sparking military tension in the region, Greenpeace said Thursday quoting leaked diplomatic cables, as foreign ministers from Arctic countries gathered in Greenland. ""New revelations by... WikiLeaks show how the scramble for resources in the Arctic is sparking military tension in the region -- with NATO sources worried about the potential for armed conflict between the alliance and Russia,"" it said. According to the environmental group, cables obtained by WikiLeaks show how ""Russia is maneuvering to claim ownership over huge swathes of the Arctic,"" while the United States desires to take a strong position in Greenland and tensions are mounting within NATO. A US diplomatic note reads ""our intensified outreach to the Greenlanders will encourage them to resist any false choice between the United States and Europe."" Another dispatch from Canada said Prime Minister Stephen Harper was quoted by diplomats as saying a NATO presence in the Arctic would ""give non-Arctic members of the Western alliance too much influence in an area where 'they don’t belong',"" Greenpeace said. The environmental group charged the cables' revelations ""expose something profoundly concerning."" ""Instead of seeing the melting of the Arctic ice cap as a spur to action on climate change, the leaders of the Arctic nations are instead investing in military hardware to fight for the oil beneath it,"" campaigner Ben Ayliffe said. ""They’re preparing to fight to extract the very fossil fuels that caused the melting in the first place. It’s like pouring gasoline on a fire,"" he added. Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden met Thursday in Greenland's tiny capital to set down rules for opening the Arctic to fishing, tourism, oil and mineral exploration as global warming melts the ice. rdm/cw"
Recession-weary Iceland in no mood for new struggle with force of nature.,Iceland,"ECONOMIC GLOOM: Since the first volcanic ash cloud eruption last year, crisis-stricken Iceland has slipped into a pessimistic mood, writes BALDUR ARNARSONin Reykjavík FIRST CAME what Icelanders stoically labelled an eruption for tourists in the Fimmvörðuháls area – an ash column and elegant flow of lava in March 2010 that pleased the eye and the cameras. Several weeks later the much-anticipated report by the special investigation commission into the origins and causes of the economic collapse was published. But then came the ash clouds. Less than 60 hours after the report was introduced with much fanfare, its revelations were overshadowed by the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. The eruption was everything but elegant. The violent spew of volcanic ash threatened the livelihood of numerous farmers and the tourism sector – one of the pillars of the €9 billion economy – suffered a collapse in bookings. The island was thrust into an alternative crisis mode. Dreary economic analysis was replaced by headlines about the disruption to international air travel caused by the towering column of ash. Somewhere in between a feel-good factor sneaked in. For perhaps the first time since pop singer Björk rose to international stardom, Icelanders again enjoyed a world attention that was not rooted in the folly of overambitious bankers. To follow was an unusually warm summer. Tourists returned in record numbers. The economy seemed on the mend. A sigh of relief was heard at Reykjavík cafes. But then came the autumn. The gloomy economic reality again settled in the national consciousness. Unemployment increased for the third consecutive autumn to its post-crisis norm of 7-9 per cent. According to Gissur Pétursson, chairman of the directorate of labour, such persistent figures have not been seen since the 1930s in a nation of historically low unemployment. Furthering this point, thousands of Icelanders have voted with their feet and looked for job opportunities abroad, many in oil-rich Norway. Adding to the unemployment and emigration, the devaluation of the Icelandic krona in recent months – the euro was standing at 83 ISK in May 2007 but now buys 164 ISK – and lack of foreign investment have contributed to an economic slowdown. The result has been a dramatic decrease in purchasing power. Imported goods have in some cases doubled in prices since the boom years. The ageing car fleet perhaps best represents this reversal. Should the situation not improve, Iceland will soon be on a par with eastern Europe in terms of the age of the car fleet, according to an analysis by the Icelandic Federation for Motor Trades and Repairs. Record oil prices have also decreased the scope for personal consumption, with Gunnar Svalur Sveinsson, an expert at the Icelandic Travel Industry Association, arguing that “the situation is beginning to resemble the norm in undeveloped and emerging economies”. “Many Icelanders can no longer afford to buy the services that foreign tourists enjoy on the island,” he recently remarked in an interview with Morgunblaðið, a daily newspaper. As to be expected, the poor have suffered most from the sharp decrease in purchasing power. Nevertheless, it came as a shock to many when Guðmundur Magnússon, chairman of the Organisation of Disabled in Iceland, brought attention to the fact that hundreds of Icelanders are suffering from malnutrition due to their dire financial situation. Add to this the almost constant political turmoil – three MPs from the Left Green Movement recently broke ranks, reducing the parliamentary majority to one seat – and the result is an annus horribilis. As ash clouds return, hopes for a social revival have given way to pessimism on the economic front. The recession-weary community is, therefore, in no mood for another struggle with the forces of nature. Conferences have already been called off due to the disruption to air travel caused by the Grímsvötn eruption. With economic growth supposedly relying on tourism and consumption this year, any loss of revenue will be strongly felt in the trade and service industries. Unfortunately for the embattled government, the spewing of volcanic ash, expected to recede in the coming days, is unlikely to put the grim economic reality aside for long. Should the situation not improve, desperation might bring about another but more violent wave of protests. This time around bricks and sticks might replace the pots and pans of the 2009 saucepan revolution."
Monday Interview : Graham Stewart : Stewart has his eyes on his heritage as well as the prize off Shetland Isles,Iceland,"GRAHAM Stewart should be put on a retainer by the Faroe Islands' tourist board. As he enthuses about the people, cultural and wildlife of the Faroes, I'm whisked away from the foyer of an Edinburgh hotel and transported to the self-governing Danish islands, lying between Shetland and Iceland. Although he was raised in Edinburgh, Stewart's mother is from the Faroes and her son fell in love with the islands while visiting as a teenager. The trip was to shape his life; Stewart chose to enter the oil and gas industry so he could continue to have contact with the islands. While working closely with Tom Cross at Dana Petroleum, Stewart set up oil and gas explorer Faroe Petroleum in 1998. Having served together at the Petroleum Science and Technology Institute in Edinburgh, Cross was happy for his finance director to leave Dana in 2002 to concentrate full-time on Faroe. Cross's Dana took a 20 per cent stake in the fledgling Faroe Petroleum in 2003 for GBP7 million, a holding that has now passed to the Korea National Oil Corporation (Knoc) following last year's acquisition of the Scottish group. Even though the Faroes might be his first love, Stewart's attention is now firmly focused further south, on the Atlantic ocean to the west of Shetland. ""The Atlantic margin is the final frontier in UK waters,"" explains Stewart, 50. ""If there are any big discoveries still to be made then that's where they're most likely to be."" His confidence in the region was put to the test last Monday when Faroe announced ""disappointing"" results from its Lagavulin test well, the most northerly drilled in UK waters, and one of the deepest to boot. Although hydrocarbons were encountered, no ""workable reservoir system"" was found and so the Lagavulin well will be plugged and abandoned. Faroe's shares dropped 13 per cent on the day to close at 148p, and then see-sawed along with the rest of the market for the remainder of the week, closing up 2 per cent on Friday at 149p. But, as the week progressed, City analysts were falling over one another to declared that the sell-off in Faroe's shares was a buying opportunity because of the other 17 wells it has lined up in its fully-funded exploration programme through to the end of 2013. Stewart denies there was any need for a charm offensive following the release of the drilling results, which he only received late on the preceding Friday afternoon. ""I spoke to one or two shareholders who I was scheduled to speak to anyway over the course of the week but they already understood it was a high-impact but also high-risk well,"" he says. ""A couple of analysts called to find out more information about what we had encountered in the well and they understand the investment case."" Lagavulin took longer than Faroe had initially expected due to bad weather over the winter, a tighter regulatory regime following BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and tricky rock formation through which it had to drill. Yet Stewart said the extra costs associated with Lagavulin - which some analysts estimated could be as high as GBP12m - would not dent the firm's planned drilling programme because Faroe had received an unexpected windfall after buying an 18 per cent stake from Italian oil firm Eni in the Blane field in the North Sea. Selling some of the Blane oil inventory netted the Aberdeen-based firm an unexpected dollars 45m (GBP28m), more than offsetting the extra costs at Lagavulin. The acquisition will also help to cut the firm's UK tax bill. While Faroe held only a 10 per cent stake in the Lagavulin well, which was drilled by Chevron, its next project along the Atlantic margin places the Scottish company directly in the spotlight. Faroe will be the operator for the Fulla prospect, which is due to begin drilling before the end of the month and in which Faroe and Canadian Overseas Petroleum each hold 50 per cent stakes. Stewart thinks Fulla - which is expected to be lower-cost and lower-risk than Lagavulin - could ""possibly"" be better for Faroe if it strikes oil. While the west of Shetland is a key area for Faroe - with the company having the third-largest acreage in the region, behind Dong and StatOil - Stewart hasn't put all his eggs in one basket. His company also has an extensive drilling programme focused on Norway, where production tax breaks help to offset exploration costs for smaller companies. Stewart has been an outspoken critic of Chancellor George Osborne's surprise North Sea tax hike in March's budget. ""There seems to be this perception that the North Sea is the goose that will keep on laying the golden eggs,"" Stewart says. ""But if they keep increasing taxes then the goose is going to stop laying. Thirteen of our 18 exploration wells this year are going to be in Norwegian waters, which tells you something about how we view the tax regimes in Norway compared with the UK."" Background GRAHAM Stewart, 50, was educated at the Royal High School in Edinburgh before studying offshore engineering at Heriot-Watt University and then gaining a master's degree in business administration from Edinburgh University. His career has included spells at Schlumberger and DNV Technica, as well as the Petroleum Science and Technology Institute, where he worked alongside Tom Cross. Stewart later served as Cross' commercial director and finance director at Aberdeen-based oil and gas explorer Dana Petroleum between 1997 and 2002. Stewart founded Faroe Petroleum in 1998 and was its chairman until 2002, when he left Dana to become Faroe's chief executive."
Chinese in bid to buy Icelandic land,Iceland,"News | INVESTMENT A Chinese millionaire wants to buy 300sq km of wilderness in Iceland, raising fears that Beijing is trying to extend its influence into the North Atlantic. Huang Nubo plans, if given permission by the Icelandic government, to use the land for a £61m eco-tourism and golf resort. He is ranked as China's 161st richest person. Land around the world has been bought up by Chinese interests in recent years and there is concern that the planned purchase of Grímsstadir á Fjöllum, in the remote north-east of the country, would offer a foothold in a region that could become an important staging post if retreating ice cover leads to the oil and gas industry moving into the Arctic."

Chinese tycoon to buy piece of Iceland for €70m.,Iceland,"ONE OF China’s best-known property developers Huang Nubo, a poet and mountaineer with extensive Communist Party links, is planning to spend €70 million to buy a 300sq km chunk of Iceland to build a luxury eco-tourism project. But the size and location of the site has sparked fears that perhaps the project could be merely a first step in a geopolitical powerplay that might threaten Iceland’s sovereignty. The piece of land in question is nearly one quarter the size of Hong Kong. Mr Huang, listed by Forbesmagazine as China’s 161st richest person with a net worth of €617 million, has struck a deal with private landowners in Iceland for the tract of land in the Grímsstadir á Fjöllum region, and the luxury development would include an eco-tourism golf resort project, the Financial Timesreported. “We face the fact that a foreign tycoon wants to buy 300 square kilometres of Icelandic land. We have to discuss it and not swallow without chewing; would we find it all right if the entire country were sold this way?” Iceland interior minister Ögmundur Jónasson told the Iceland Review. “People are often too quick to accept offers like these,” he said. The deal requires the approval of both China and Iceland. No one has anything to fear, insists Mr Huang. “The project is a purely commercial move and has no connection with politics. The concerns are groundless,” he was quoted saying by China’s official new agency, Xinhua. A deeply mercantilist nation, China is always looking for ways to expand trade links around the world. Iceland occupies a strategically important location between Europe and North America and could function as a potential hub for Asian cargo should climate change open Arctic waters to shipping. An entrepreneur, Mr Huang (55) tends to describe himself as a poet, who writes under the pseudonym Luoying, and he is also famous for his mountaineering exploits in China. He is a high-profile capitalist, and he has a reputation as a philanthropist, but his Communist Party credentials are solid. Mr Huang is a former propaganda department section chief and has also worked as an administrator at a section of the ministry of construction, one of the agencies responsible for preserving historic sites. His company, which he established in 1995, manages many of China’s most famous tourist sites, such as Hongchun in Anhui Province and Zhongdian near Tibet in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Zhongkun is also developing projects in Nashville, Tennessee, and in Los Angeles, and also has interests in Japan. His ambitions in Iceland are well documented. Last year he said he was planning to organise a poetry forum in Reykjavik, and he donated €700,000 to the “China-Iceland Culture Fund”. Energy is central to the links between China and Iceland at the moment. China is the world’s leading investor in alternative energy technologies, and has formed a partnership with Iceland to develop geothermal technologies. China’s second biggest oil and gas company, China Petroleum Chemical Corp, has committed to making geothermal one of its main businesses, and has signed a deal with Iceland’s Geysir Green Energy to jointly develop the renewable energy source. China has been working hard to forge solid financial links with Iceland, which has been struggling since its economy collapsed in 2008 after a banking crisis, which saw three of its major banks collapse within weeks. Iceland is currently struggling under the weight of a bailout by the International Monetary Fund. Iceland has been desperate to improve its access to foreign currency since then and in June last year, Iceland’s central bank, Sedlabanki, signed a currency swap agreement with China worth 66 billion krona (€400 million). Political links appear to be very strong, particularly as Iceland appears to feel that China was speedy in stepping in to help when the economy collapsed. Relations were less than friendly in 2008, when Icelandic singer Bjork shouted “Tibet! Tibet!” at the end of her song Declare Independence! during a concert in Shanghai. If the bid for the Icelandic territory is successful, the Chinese will own 0.3 per cent of the total land area of the singer’s homeland."
Iceland's president welcomes Chinese interest,Iceland,"Iceland's president has hailed a controversial Chinese investment as a sign of the country's blossoming ties with the rising Asian power, while alleging that Europe and the US abandoned their north Atlantic neighbour in the wake of its devastating financial crisis three years ago. ""China and India lent Iceland a helping hand in many constructive ways whereas Europe was hostile and the US was absent,"" Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson told the Financial Times, as he responded to a controversy over the proposed sale of a large tract of Iceland to a Chinese tycoon for an eco-tourism resort. Some Icelandic politicians and business leaders are concerned the project could be a cover for China's strategic interest in the country as global warming opens up the nearby Arctic to oil exploration and shipping. But Mr Grímsson said that, while the sale required scrutiny, he saw no reason to fear Chinese investment and praised the interest shown by China and India in Iceland at a time when relations with its traditional Nato allies have grown tense. While Iceland received a European-led bail-out from the International Monetary Fund and talks are under way for the country to join the European Union, Mr Grímsson accused the EU of ""turning their guns"" on Iceland during the dispute over money lost by UK and Dutch depositors in the failed Icesave bank . He added that the US had shown ""zero interest"" in the country since closing its air base near Reykjavik five years ago. Mr Grímsson, in office for the past 15 years, is known as a maverick often at odds with the country's centre-left government. While his remarks reflect widespread public resentment over alleged bullying by Iceland's western allies since the bank crash, not all Icelanders share his enthusiasm for Chinese investment. Some government ministers have expressed reservations over the plan by Huang Nubo, a real estate entrepreneur and former Communist party official, to buy 300 square kilometres of wilderness in the country's north-east. Mr Huang told the Financial Times on Friday it would send a negative signal to other Chinese investors in Iceland if the deal fell through. ""It will be like killing the monkey to scare the chickens,"" he said while stroking his pet cat, Little Sister Big Eyes. A keen mountaineer and poet, the 55-year-old says he was drawn to Iceland by his love of nature and memories of his college years there, when the mother of his Icelandic roommate sent hand-knitted woollen sweaters to keep them warm during winter. Mr Grímsson has prioritised relations with China and India, while promoting Iceland as a potential Arctic logistics hub and touting its expertise in geothermal power. He has visited China five times in the past six years and claims to have received more Chinese delegations to Iceland during his presidency than ""the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain combined"". Mr Grímsson revealed that, in the weeks after the 2008 bank collapse, he wrote to China's president, Hu Jintao, for assistance. That approach was the catalyst for last year's $500m currency swap agreement between the two countries India had also been supportive, opening an embassy in Reykjavik weeks after the crisis and inviting him on a state visit at the height of Iceland's Icesave dispute with the UK. Indian investors are planning to build a five-star hotel near Thingvellir, a Unesco world heritage site as home to Iceland's ancient Viking parliament and the place where the continental plates of Europe and North America meet. Mr Grímsson said Iceland stood to benefit from the growth of foreign travel by Chinese and Indian tourists: ""In big Asian cities, many people have never experienced solitude or wilderness. In Iceland, we have always take this for granted but now we see it could be as valuable a resource for us as fish stocks and geothermal power."""
China and the world: A chilly reception,Iceland,"Winds sweep across a highland plateau featuring little but coarse grass and volcanic rock. Dirty patches of last winter's snow cling to surrounding mountains awaiting replenishment as the short, cool summer yields to autumn. It is not immediately clear why anyone would want to pay $9m for the desolate area of north-east Iceland known as Grímsstadir á Fjöllum, less still to invest another $100m or more building a luxury hotel and golf course. Yet that is the intention of Huang Nubo, a Chinese tycoon and self-described poet and adventurer, whose provisional deal to buy 300 square kilometres of Icelandic wilderness has left many in the country searching warily for ulterior motives. Some suspect the former official in the Communist party's propaganda department is a Trojan horse for Chinese strategic interest in Iceland. Halfway between Europe and North America, the country played a crucial role in north Atlantic security during the cold war and could take on renewed significance if global warming opens the nearby Arctic to oil exploration and shipping. Mr Huang says such conspiracy theories are unfounded. He has had ties to the country since sharing a room with an Icelandic student at Peking university and he fell in love with the place when visiting for the first time last year to sponsor a poetry festival. Sitting in his Beijing office, surrounded by memorabilia from his mountaineering expeditions, he says: ""I thought it was so beautiful. I love wild, barren places."" Yet, whatever his motives, the deal shows how China and its entrepreneurs are increasingly looking to exercise their growing financial muscle abroad. From African farmland and Chilean iron ore to French châteaux and Swedish car companies, Chinese investors are buying up land and resources around the world. This signals a change from the growth model of the past few decades, which was heavily reliant on inbound foreign direct investment. China vied with the US as the world's top FDI destination for much of the past decade. Until now, Beijing's capital controls have made it hard for Chinese business to invest overseas. But those restrictions are being eased and outbound direct investment has jumped from about $15bn in 2004 to more than $220bn by the end of last year, according to government estimates. Even so, China still accounts for only 1.2 per cent of total world FDI, about the same as Denmark. Though this is higher than that of emerging markets such as Brazil and India, it is only about one-twentieth that of the US. But by all accounts China is at the start of a global buying spree that will reshape the global economic landscape and probably the physical landscape, too. Robert Zoellick, World Bank president, says the phenomenon could have benefits such as easing imbalances in global capital flows and encouraging internationalisation of the renminbi. ""It's a natural development for a growing economy that's going to play a larger role in the international economic system,"" he told the Financial Times. ""I think this can actually be constructive."" However, the uproar caused by Mr Huang's project highlights the suspicion facing Chinese investors overseas. The 55-year-old says he was dismayed by global media reaction. He was en route to Tibet this week when he read in the FT that some Icelandic politicians had expressed concern. Until then, he says, he had heard only positive things in meetings with officials. ""I'm just a businessman - why does everyone think I have the government at my back?"" Dressed in sweatpants, he does not look the strait-laced apparatchik, nor is his office typical of a Chinese businessman's. The lobby features sculptures inspired by his poems; crampons and oxygen tanks are lined up outside the meeting room. A litter of grey kittens runs around, vying for his attention. Upstairs, beside his bedroom, he keeps two monkeys, several parrots and a rabbit. He used to keep sharks but says they failed to thrive in Beijing. Mr Huang, who has climbed Everest and reached the north and south poles, rejects any claim that his deal is motivated by strategic considerations. ""It's true that I have a government background. But I didn't want to be a bureaucrat,"" he says, stroking a purring kitten. ""Could a bureaucrat keep cats in his office?"" The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. <> Despite his eccentricity, in many ways he is typical of the growing ranks of tycoons looking to spread their wings beyond China. Having made his fortune in property, he owns leisure and tourism assets across the country, placing him 161st among its richest people, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $890m. ""We stand at the dawn of hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese mergers, acquisitions and investments in new greenfield facilities around the world over the decades to come,"" says Daniel Rosen of the Petersen Institute for International Economics in Washington. In a recent report, he estimated that if China follows the typical pattern of an emerging economy it will make as much as $2,000bn-worth of direct investments abroad by 2020. Until recently, most overseas Chinese investments have been in Asia, Latin America and Africa, as the state seeks to secure the natural resources needed to fuel its commodity-intensive growth engine. Today, while Chinese state-owned enterprises account for more than 70 per cent of the country's outbound FDI stock, according to government figures, smaller private companies and individuals are increasingly looking abroad, too. Natural resources remain central but Beijing is encouraging all domestic companies to compete in overseas markets and acquire skills and technology. At the same time, Beijing is trying to maintain control over the targets of outbound investment to avoid any political backlash from overseas and stop its investors being seen as ""dumb money"". It has blocked several deals by state-owned and private companies that did not fit prevailing industrial, political or macroeconomic policy. Mr Huang admits his project could yet meet that fate, saying: ""It's possible that the Chinese government will not approve it, if they think it would impact China's image abroad."" Icelandic approval, too, is far from certain, as the country weighs the appeal of a big foreign investment in its troubled economy - a victim of the financial crisis when its banking sector collapsed in 2008 - against unease over Chinese influence. Similar dilemmas face countries elsewhere. The developed world's economic woes, combined with the seemingly relentless march of Chinese growth, have left many feeling vulnerable and wary of opportunistic investors swooping in to buy assets on the cheap. In a recent report for the European Council on Foreign Relations, François Godement and Jonas Parello-Plesner voiced some of the concerns being raised in European capitals and in many other parts of the world. ""Crisis-hit Europe's need for short-term cash is allowing Chinese companies not just to strike cut-price deals but also to play off member states against each other and against their own collective interests - replicating a strategy China has already used in the developing world,"" the authors said. They also voiced concerns about reciprocity that are widely held in countries with companies trying to crack the Chinese market. ""The problem presented by Chinese direct investment in Europe becomes even clearer when one considers Europe's limited access to similar opportunities in China,"" they wrote. ""In a nutshell, this means that China's Geely can buy Sweden's Volvo but Chinese regulations block the reverse."" Back at Grímsstadir á Fjöllum, people living in the area's handful of small farms and guesthouses are reluctant to talk about Mr Huang's plans. One woman, peering around a half-opened door, says she is worried about the environmental impact of a big tourism project; but another resident expresses enthusiasm for the jobs it would create. Their requests for anonymity attest to the sensitivity of the subject in this tiny community. While some Icelandic politicians have voiced concern, including the minister responsible for approving the deal, President Olafur Ragnar Grímsson is sympathetic to Mr Huang. ""Nobody talked about geopolitical implications when Iceland flooded its valleys to create hydroelectricity for western aluminium companies,"" he recalls. ""But when a Chinese poet wants to build a hotel, everyone goes crazy."" Critics say this is naive. ""You don't need to buy 0.3 per cent of Iceland to build a hotel,"" says one prominent Reykjavik business leader. For his part, Mr Huang says the size of the area reflects the fact that multiple owners have pooled together to sell their land as a big bloc. Only a fraction of it is suitable for building on, he says. In addition to the hotel and golf course, his plans include hot- air balloon rides and horse stables. Guests will be flown in from Reykjavik to a small airstrip on two small planes he will buy. ""It's extraordinarily beautiful,"" he reiterates. ""Mankind's last real vacation paradise."""
Chinese target Arctic with Iceland land deal: experts,Iceland,"A Chinese businessman's plans to buy a swathe of Iceland for a resort have sparked local scepticism, amid speculation it is a bid by Beijing to get its hands on Arctic riches. The melting Arctic ice cap means lucrative oil and gas deposits under the seabed could soon become accessible, and shorter shipping routes between Asia and Europe will open up. Observers suggest those prospects may be the real reason behind property tycoon Huang Nubo's plans to buy 300 square kilometres (200 square miles) of Icelandic wildnerness. He says he wants to build a luxury resort with a hotel, golf course and sports facilities, and Europe's biggest nature reserve. The purchase could give China a foothold in the region -- enabling it to establish contacts and gather information -- before the Arctic treasure chest opens up. ""It is likely that the Chinese government will find every way to enhance cooperation at multiple levels -- scientific, economic, political and otherwise -- to lay the groundwork for future involvement in the construction and operation of infrastructural hubs"" in the Arctic, Embla Eir Oddsdottir, project manager at The Stefansson Arctic Institute in Iceland, told AFP. ""The possibility of shipping and transport across the Arctic is very important for China,"" she noted. With the icecap melting in summertime, the route between the Atlantic and the Pacific will shorten the sailing distance between Shanghai and Europe by about 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles). ""In talks with Icelandic authorities, (the Chinese) have made a point of saying it was very plausible"" that China would use Iceland as a trans-Arctic shipping port, the chairman of the Icelandic parliament's foreign affairs committee, Arni Thor Sigurdsson, told AFP. Marc Lanteigne, a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and an expert on China's rise as a strategic and economic power, said there were ""very strong, and often very opaque, links between large Chinese businesses and the country's government."" China could especially be eying the up to 160 billion barrels of oil believed to be in the Arctic. ""China is now importing more than 50 percent of its crude oil consumed, and like other large economies is worried about the safety of petroleum imports from the Middle East and is seeking alternative sources,"" Lanteigne said. He noted Beijing had been active in the oil trade in Central Asia, the Caspian region and sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. ""It is therefore very likely that China would want to increase its presence in the Arctic out of concern for being left out of oil exploration there,"" he said. Sigurdsson noted China had ""no direct claim to natural resources"" in the region, but could ""become a participant ... by cooperating with states or companies searching for resources."" Observers stressed there was no concrete indication Beijing would use Huang's land purchase to hunt for Arctic riches. Yet his plans have raised eyebrows in Reykjavik, where Interior Minister Oegmundur Jonasson has said he would scrutinise the application carefully. Jonasson insisted the land ""is not up for sale simply because a high price is being offered."" Huang has offered to buy the partially state-held land, known as Grimsstadir a Fjoellum, for $10 million and wants to invest a total of $100 million (70 million euros). The former government official, whose company Zhongkun Group owns resorts and tourist facilities worldwide, has said he is attracted by Iceland's wilderness and pledged to respect the local environment. Tourism bureau chief Oloef Yr Atladottir said she was favourable to Huang's plans, saying the investment as presented would be ""very positive."" A recent poll showed 59.1 percent of Icelanders were wary yet supported the sale, largely because Iceland could use the much-needed cash injection after its devastating 2008 economic crash. Since the collapse of its overweighted financial sector, tourism has become a key source of revenue. Lanteigne said the location Huang had chosen was notable. ""The location ... is significant given that northern Iceland is being viewed as a potential depot for fossil fuel exploration vessels,"" he said. In addition, Iceland's position in the North Atlantic ""would mean that a Chinese strategic presence of any type would be enough to unsettle governments in the United States and Europe,"" Lanteigne said. He stressed however that ""at present there does not appear to be any sign that the proposed purchase is anything but a strictly business transaction."" str/po/nl/jj/rl"
Geothermal power: A laboratory for life after fossil fuels,Iceland,"Iceland's President Olafur Ragnar Grímsson has only to look out his window for a reminder of his country's clean energy potential. From the white-washed presidential residence on a windswept peninsula outside Reykjavik, he can look across the capital to a volcanic mountain range behind. It is Iceland's location on a geological hotspot in the middle of the North Atlantic that makes it one of the world's leading developers of geothermal power - electricity generated from the heat of the earth's core. Now, as the country battles its way back from a crippling financial crisis, Mr Grímsson is promoting its geothermal resources as a driving force behind economic recovery. He has travelled the globe selling Iceland's geothermal expertise with a focus on the world's big emerging economies. ""Clean energy has become the pillar of co-operation between Iceland and China and also with India,"" he told the Financial Times. ""These countries can see the potential of geothermal power to help meet their rising energy needs."" Chinese interest in Iceland - including a recent deal by a Chinese tycoon to buy a large swathe of Icelandic wilderness for a tourism project - has sparked fears in the west that Beijing could be seeking a strategic foothold in the North Atlantic. But Mr Grímsson says the primary focus of bilateral relations is energy, as China looks for help in meeting its goal to produce 15 per cent of its energy needs from non-fossil fuels by 2020. It may seem strange for a country of 1.3bn people to be seeking guidance on energy matters from a nation whose entire population, at 320,000, is smaller than most districts of Beijing. Yet, with almost all its electricity and heating needs provided by geothermal and hydro power, Iceland is a laboratory for life in a post-fossil fuel world. Mr Grímsson has been cultivating energy ties with Beijing since taking former Chinese president Jiang Zemin to visit a geothermal plant during a stop in Reykjavík in 2002. ""You could see the Chinese delegation came away seeing geothermal energy in a new light,"" he recalls. Since then, the two countries have signed formal co-operation agreements to work together on geothermal projects in China and other parts of the world. Chinese engineers, meanwhile, have been sent to Iceland to study at a United Nations-run geothermal training centre. China may not be as well known as Iceland for its volcanoes and hot springs but geothermal power is accessible in many parts of the country. An Icelandic company called Enex has been developing a geothermal heating system in Xianyang, a city in Shaanxi province, in a joint venture with Sinopec, the Chinese state-owned energy group, with plans for similar projects elsewhere. Beijing is among other cities considered to have geothermal potential. China is one of many countries in which Icelandic geothermal companies are active, ranging from Slovakia and Hungary to Kenya and El Salvador. The idea of Icelandic engineers spreading clean energy to the world represents an appealing contrast to the country's ill-fated flirtation with international banking over the past decade. However, it is at home where Icelanders stand to make the biggest economic gains from the bubbling hot spots beneath their feet. With much greater supplies of power than its tiny population could ever consume, Iceland has used its surplus electricity to attract investment and jobs from the energy-intensive aluminium smelting industry. Electricity is so cheap that it makes economic sense for smelting companies, including Alcoa and Rio Tinto Alcan, to produce aluminium in Iceland, despite its isolated location. There are three smelting plants in operation, with one under construction and another two planned. Anxious about over-reliance on aluminium, the country is seeking to diversify into other energy-hungry industries. A big data centre, for example, is under construction at the former Nato air base at Keflavík, west of Reykjavik. Geothermal power companies are increasing capacity to meet rising industrial demand. Alterra Power, a Canadian renewable energy company, recently won approval to expand its Reykjanes geothermal plant from 100MW to 180MW. However, not all Icelanders are happy about commercial exploitation of their country's energy reserves. Environmentalists have fought against the aluminium industry for decades and the Canadian takeover of a domestic power company by Alterra, previously known as Magma Energy, last year was deeply unpopular. Björk, the Icelandic pop star, led the protests over a deal that she claimed would give foreigners too much power over the country's natural resources. Controversy also surrounds tentative plans to export Icelandic electricity via a 1,170km undersea cable to Scotland. The idea has been mooted for years but appeared to take a step forward in March when it emerged that Landsvirkjun, the state-owned utility that produces three-quarters of Iceland's electricity, was conducting a feasibility study. The $2.1bn project has become more viable as technological advances make it possible to transmit electricity over longer distances through high-voltage cables. Supporters say an Iceland-UK power link could make energy exports as valuable to the Icelandic economy as oil and gas is to Norway. For the UK, it would help cut greenhouse gas emissions and provide more reliable supplies than wind power. Many Icelanders are cautious about letting the rest of Europe share in their energy riches. However, with an estimated three-quarters of the country's geothermal resources still undeveloped, advocates say there is more than enough to go round."
Iceland asks Chinese tycoon for details on land purchase,Iceland,"Reykjavik has asked a Chinese property tycoon to provide more details about his company and its planned land purchase in Iceland before it grants approval, his local agent said Tuesday. Huang Nubo asked the Icelandic government five weeks ago for permission to buy 300 square kilometres (200 square miles) of Icelandic wildnerness to build a resort, since the land is partly owned by the government and approval is required for a non-resident of the European Economic Area to buy land. Huang has offered to buy the land, known as Grimsstadir a Fjoellum, for $10 million and wants to invest some $200 million (147 million euros). Iceland's Interior Minister Oegmundur Jonasson has sent Huang a letter asking for details on his company, Zhongkun, and his plans, agent Halldor Johansson told AFP. ""There is a certain reluctance in the ministry, but the letter does not take any position in the matter,"" he said, adding that Huang's response was expected to arrive at the ministry in the coming days. Huang has said he wants to build a luxury resort with a hotel, golf course and sports facilities, and Europe's biggest nature reserve. Icelandic observers have suggested that Huang's purchase could help Beijing get a foothold in the Arctic region, as the melting ice cap means lucrative oil and gas deposits under the seabed could soon become accessible and shorter shipping routes open up. Huang, whose company Zhongkun Group owns resorts and tourist facilities worldwide, has said he is attracted by Iceland's wilderness and pledged to respect the local environment. str/ig/po/nl/ga"
New border control fears,Iceland,"Independence would lead to new border controls with England unless Scotland rejected European Union membership, according to leaked UK Government legal advice. An independent Scotland would be forced to join a European free travel area that the UK has refused to sign up to, it warns. The Herald revealed yesterday that UK Government lawyers had warned Scotland would not automatically remain a member of the EU. Instead, an independent Scotland would have to reapply, a process that could cost billions in lost funding and take up to three years, advice seen by The Herald shows. Scotland would also be expected to fulfil a number of criteria as a “new” member of the union, including membership of the euro. However, the advice reveals the price of joining the EU would also be to sign up to the Schengen Agreement – whereby free travel is allowed between many European countries. As the UK is currently outside the Schengen area, and is determined to remain so, Scotland’s membership would trigger new controls, such as passport checks, at the border with England. Being forced to sign up to Schengen would also force Scotland to leave the current free travel area between the UK and Ireland, according to the official advice. Scotland would not be able to control those entering the country from the Schengen area, potentially leading to an increase in economic migrants. Labour MPs have previously warned that independence could lead to travellers being forced to show their passports at Gretna. The SNP has always denied that independence would lead to controls at the border. The party insists that there would be easy and free movement between Scotland and England, much as there is now, and free access to each other’s markets. And it has denounced as a “myth” the idea an independent Scotland would not automatically become an EU member in its own right. The original Schengen Agreement was signed in the mid-1980s but not implemented until five years later. It created a borderless Schengen area, which allows international travel with no internal border controls. The Schengen area currently consists of 25 European countries, and means anyone can travel from Tallinn to Lisbon without having to show a passport. It was designed to ensure freedom of travel and boost tourism across participating member countries. However, the UK has always rejected its terms and successive governments have made clear that they will stay outside the common travel area. Yesterday the Scottish Government insisted the legal advice was wrong and Scotland would automatically remain part of the EU. A spokesman for the First Minister said: “As far as the leaked section of this Westminster document is concerned, it is a case of ‘ask a silly question, get a silly answer’.” He added: “When there are 27 existing EU members – and Croatia, Macedonia, Turkey, Iceland and Montenegro are lined up to join – the idea that oil-rich, resource-rich Scotland would not continue our EU membership is a particularly decrepit argument against independence.” He also insisted an independent Scotland would not be forced to join the euro as a process of EU membership. “This is complete nonsense,” he said. “The issue of the euro would be decided by a referendum of the people of Scotland when the economic circumstances were right – until such a point, an independent Scotland will retain sterling as at present.”"
Chinese tycoon one step closer to Icelandic land purchase,Iceland,"A Chinese property tycoon is one step closer to getting Icelandic approval for his plans to buy a large swathe of land for a tourist resort, an economic affairs ministry memo released on Thursday showed. The ministry said it was favourable to Huang Nubo's plans in its memo to the interior ministry, which will make the final decision. Icelandic law requires government approval for land sales to citizens outside the European Economic Area (EEA). ""The ministry of economic affairs sees no reason to believe that Iceland's interests are in any way threatened by the foreign investment in question,"" Economic Affairs Minister Arni Pall Arnason wrote in a memo to Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson. It is not yet known when Jonasson will announce his decision. Huang Nubo asked the Icelandic government in late August for permission to buy 300 square kilometres (200 square miles) of Icelandic wildnerness to build a resort, since the land is partly owned by the government and approval is required for a non-resident of the European Economic Area to buy land. Huang has offered to buy the land, known as Grimsstadir a Fjoellum, for $10 million and wants to invest some $200 million (147 million euros). Iceland's Interior Minister Oegmundur Jonasson has said he would scrutinise the application carefully. Jonasson insisted the land ""is not up for sale simply because a high price is being offered."" Huang has said he wants to build a luxury resort with a hotel, golf course and sports facilities, and Europe's biggest nature reserve. Icelandic observers have suggested that Huang's purchase could help Beijing get a foothold in the Arctic region, as the melting ice cap means lucrative oil and gas deposits under the seabed could soon become accessible and shorter shipping routes open up. str-po/nl/hd"
"Reader, I loved them",Iceland,"Business and economics Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty, by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, PublicAffairs, RRP£15.99 This guide to tackling poverty, based on field research, suggests ways of overcoming the inertia, ideology and ignorance that so often reduce the effectiveness of aid spending. Winner of the 2011 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award, this was described by the judges as of particular relevance for a world riven by inequality. Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck - Why Some Thrive Despite Them All, by Jim Collins and Morten T Hansen, Random House Business Books, RRP£25 Collins, author of business classics such as Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap ... and Others Don't, teams up with Hansen to analyse how some companies prosper even in the most turbulent conditions. Using compelling examples from mountaineering to corporate America, they prove it's not about luck but about meticulous preparation, relentless discipline and creativity based on hard evidence of what works. Triumph of the City: How Our Greatest Invention Makes Us Richer, Smarter, Greener, Healthier and Happier, by Edward Glaeser, Macmillan, RRP£9.99 Economist Glaeser places his bet on cities as our best hope, arguing that for all their faults, close-knit metropolitan communities - if properly run - are financially, environmentally and creatively the best mode of human cohabitation. Glaeser's study was a finalist for Business Book of the Year. The Shift: The Future of Work is Already Here, by Lynda Gratton, HarperCollins, RRP£14.99 What does a fast-changing world hold for workers, confused about the way forward?

Adapt: Why Success Always Starts with Failure, by Tim Harford, Little, Brown, RRP£20 The FT columnist and Undercover Economist takes a timely look at failures and what they can teach us about how to solve complex problems, from Iraq to Broadway. It's a manifesto for trial and error versus traditional command-and-control leadership. The Fear Index, by Robert Harris, Hutchinson, RRP£18.99 Not a business book in the classical sense, Harris's thriller is set at the sharp end of finance: inside the highly automated trading rooms of a Geneva-based hedge fund and the mind of its founding genius on the eve of the (real life) ""flash crash"" of May 2010. An enjoyable way to learn about the arcana of Cern, quants and algorithmic trading. Wilful Blindness: Why We Ignore the Obvious at Our Peril, by Margaret Heffernan, Simon & Schuster, RRP£12.99 Heffernan presents a readable analysis of the way powerful and intelligent people deliberately set aside crucial facts and turn a blind eye to fatal errors and frauds. A polemic against the dangers of docility and ""groupthink"" in every walk of life, it was another finalist for Business Book of the Year. Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography, by Walter Isaacson, Little, Brown, RRP£25 Rushed into print only weeks after the death of the Apple founder, Isaacson's book sets out to be the definitive history of Jobs's life and work. Richard Waters, reviewing it for the FT, said the exhaustive account ""deserves the wide readership it will undoubtedly get"". Grand Pursuit: A Story of Economic Genius, by Sylvia Nasar, Fourth Estate, RRP£25 The author of A Beautiful Mind repairs some of the post-crisis dents in traditional economics by writing about economic thinkers - from Dickens up to Amartya Sen - whose work has changed lives for the better. She tells some wonderful stories about their extraordinary lives along the way. Andrew Hill, FT management editor ........................................................................................................................ History The Great Sea: A Human History of the Mediterranean, by David Abulafia, Allen Lane, RRP£30 An outstanding study of one of the world's great centres of civilisation. Abulafia is a Cambridge University professor who specialises in the history of southern Europe in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Here he provides a panoramic survey of the Mediterranean from antiquity to the present day. Vanished Kingdoms: The History of Half-Forgotten Europe, by Norman Davies, Allen Lane, RRP£30 Aragon, Burgundy, Galicia - European history is rich with states and regions that either never quite achieved independence or, if they did, failed to preserve it into modern times. Davies, who made his name as a historian of Poland, excels in challenging conventional notions of Europe's past. Algeria: France's Undeclared War, by Martin Evans, Oxford University Press, RRP£20 Easily the best account of the 1954-1962 war of Algerian independence available in English. Evans, a prolific writer on Algerian history, sets new standards in weaving together the metropolitan French and north African threads of the story. Very timely on account of the Arab spring and - so far - Algeria's failure to go the way of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. The Pursuit of Italy: A History of a Land, its Regions and their Peoples, by David Gilmour, Allen Lane, RRP£25 Published to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Italy's creation as a nation state, Gilmour's book is an elegantly written, reliable and up-to-date guide to Italian history for the general reader. He contends that the vibrancy of Italy's regional identities makes up for the deficiencies of the Italian state. Being Soviet: Identity, Rumour and Everyday Life under Stalin 1939-1953, by Timothy Johnston, Oxford University Press, RRP£55 An ambitious and thought-provoking study of the lives of ordinary Soviet people from the Nazi-Soviet pact to Stalin's death. Johnston pays particular attention to how Soviet citizens reacted to official propaganda about the US and Britain, wartime allies who were transformed into cold war enemies after 1945. Heinrich Himmler: A Life, by Peter Longerich, translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe, Oxford University Press, RRP£25 Longerich, one of Germany's leading authorities on the Third Reich and the Holocaust, provides an exhaustive account of the life and career of the mass murderer who was Hitler's SS and police chief. First published in German in 2008, this is surely the final word on one of the Nazi regime's most deeply sinister figures. Jerusalem: The Biography, by Simon Sebag Montefiore, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, RRP£25 An epic and utterly absorbing study of a city whose modern religious, political and ethnic rivalries can be understood only in the context of its preceding 3,000 years of history. Montefiore writes with tremendous verve, sensitivity to historical controversy and an exceptional eye for the entertaining detail. Eisenhower 1956: The President's Year of Crisis: Suez and the Brink of War, by David A Nichols, Simon & Schuster, RRP£17.50 Eisenhower's 1953-1961 presidency, sandwiched between Roosevelt and Truman before him and Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon afterwards, is at last receiving proper attention from historians. Nichols gives a compelling narrative of the year when Ike, recovering from a heart attack, battled for re-election as the Suez and Hungarian crises unfolded. Winter King: The Dawn of Tudor England, by Thomas Penn, Allen Lane, RRP£11.99 Few historians have succeeded in capturing the personality of Henry VII, the secretive and suspicious king who usurped the English throne in 1485 and founded the Tudor dynasty. Penn pulls off this feat magnificently in a book that concentrates on the increasingly paranoid atmosphere of Henry's final years. Leningrad: Tragedy of a City under Siege 1941-1944, by Anna Reid, Bloomsbury, RRP£25 A superbly researched account of the deadliest siege of the 20th century. The Nazis intended to starve Leningrad into submission, and they very nearly achieved their goal. At the same time the Soviet regime was brutal and incompetent. Reid tells her story with perceptiveness and compassion. With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918, by David Stevenson, Allen Lane, RRP£30 No praise is too high for this compelling study of the first world war's final year. Stevenson displays a masterly grasp of the war's interrelated military, political and economic themes as he explains how Britain, France and the US survived ferocious German onslaughts and marched to victory in November 1918. Tony Barber, FT Europe editor ....................................................................... Lionel Barber, Editor of the Financial Times Yes, it was written more than half a century ago and first published in the 1980s but by far the best book I have read this year is Vasily Grossman's Life and Fate (Vintage). Set against the backdrop of the battle of Stalingrad, the novel grapples with the great ideological crimes of the 20th century. Time and again, the reader's despair is tempered by Grossman's deep sense of humanity. An extraordinary achievement. As for 2011, try Poor Economics by Professors Banerjee and Duflo of MIT, a radical but empirical examination of how to tackle poverty in the world's poorest nations. A worthy FT-Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year. Henry A Kissinger, Former US Secretary of State John Lewis Gaddis's George F Kennan: An American Life (Penguin Press) is a profound analysis of the seminal foreign policy professional who developed the concepts on which American cold war policy came to be based but who was also the most substantial critic of the way his maxims were applied. A magisterial study of a complex figure who exemplified the basic American ambivalence over its role in the world. Lucy Kellaway, FT management columnist At Last (Picador) is the final book in Edward St Aubyn's brilliant trilogy of the dysfunctional Melrose family. Patrick's impossible mother is dead and her funeral is attended by what is left of the family and a few mad, deluded and bad hangers-on. The writing is as savagely sharp and the comedy as deliciously bleak as in the previous two volumes, but what makes At Last the finest of the three is that it is the wisest. After the sadism, paedophilia, drug addiction, lechery, betrayal and loneliness, something in the end has been learnt: there is something worth keeping after all. ....................................................................... Politics Cables from Kabul: The Inside Story of the West's Afghanistan Campaign, by Sherard Cowper-Coles, Harper Collins, RRP£25 A former UK ambassador in Afghanistan describes his transformation from loyal supporter of the war to hardened sceptic, in lucid and sometimes devastating prose. A primer for a campaign that may finally be coming to an uncertain and dangerous close. A Contest for Supremacy: China, America and the Struggle for Mastery in Asia, by Aaron L Friedberg, Norton, RRP£20 A lucid and readable examination of the emerging power struggle between the US and China. Friedberg, an American academic and former White House official, is a hawk, and his book is particularly strong on the military aspects of the struggle. That Used To be Us: What Went Wrong with America - and How It Can Come Back, by Thomas L Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum, Little, Brown, RRP£25 A prominent journalist and an academic argue that America has yet to respond properly to the rise of new, dynamic powers around the world. They lay out a plan for national regeneration that focuses on clean energy, debt reduction, education, IT and political reform. George F Kennan: An American Life, by John Lewis Gaddis, Penguin Press, RRP£30 A biography of the man who devised America's strategy of ""containment"" to deal with the Soviet Union after 1945 also serves as a meditation on US foreign policy and the role of intellectuals in public life. DarkMarket: CyberThieves, CyberCops and You, by Misha Glenny, Bodley Head, RRP£18 Cyberwarfare and cybercrime are emerging as the new preoccupations of security agencies around the world. Glenny is a very skilled journalist, who blends lively reportage with an acute analysis of the issues involved. The End of the West: The Once and Future Europe, by David Marquand, Princeton University Press, RRP£16.95 Marquand's subject is slightly less sweeping than the title implies - but still vitally important. A veteran supporter of the European Union, his book stands back from the current crisis and argues that Europe suffers from outdated notions of global power and a complacent attitude to Asia - as well as the familiar ""democratic deficit"". Where China Meets India: Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia, by Thant Myint-U, Faber, RRP£20 After many years of isolation and political oppression, Burma seems finally to be changing. Myint-U's book argues that its re-emergence into the modern world will have a transforming effect on the balance of power between Asia's two giants, China and India. Can Intervention Work?, by Rory Stewart and Gerald Knaus, Norton, RRP£12.99 Written before the Libyan war, this book examines the case for ""liberal interventionism"". Stewart and Knaus are both practitioners and scholars - with particular experience in Afghanistan and Bosnia, respectively. The combined effect is pessimistic, without actually ruling out further interventions. The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev, by Daniel Triesman, Simon & Schuster, RRP£18.99 A history of post-communist Russia that takes a relatively calm and benign view of the evolution of the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The author argues that Russia, though troubled, remains a major global power. A book that is worth consulting as Vladimir Putin prepares to return to the presidency. Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China, by Ezra F Vogel, Harvard University Press, RRP£29.95 A major biography of the man who may turn out to have done more to transform the world than any other leader of the 20th century. Deng's ""market Leninism"" has massively increased China's wealth, while repressing democracy. Vogel's portrait is sympathetic, although not uncritical. The Quest: Energy, Security and the Remaking of the Modern World, by Daniel Yergin, Allen Lane, RRP£30 Yergin is the world's pre-eminent historian of the oil industry. This book is a successor to his much-acclaimed work The Prize and covers the past 20 years - including multiple upheavals in the Middle East and the emergence of climate change as a global issue. Gideon Rachman, FT chief international affairs commentator and author of 'Zero-Sum Future' (Simon & Schuster) Science Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science, by Michael Nielsen, Princeton University Press, RRP£16.95 A powerful plea for scientists to work together in new ways, using the full power of the internet and information technology. Nielsen attacks the possessive attitude to data that still pervades some fields of research and shows how much scientists can gain through more open, collaborative working - which may involve members of the public as well as those inside the academic tent. The Better Angels of Our Nature: The Decline of Violence in History and Its Causes, by Steven Pinker, Allen Lane, RRP£17.99 A hugely impressive effort to document and explain the increasingly peaceful nature of human civilisation. Pinker, a celebrated Harvard psychologist, shows how every form of violence, from rape and murder to animal cruelty, has been declining for centuries - at least on a per capita basis - and argues convincingly that the 20th century does not deserve its terrible reputation. The Tell-Tale Brain: Unlocking the Mystery of Human Nature, by VS Ramachandran, Heinemann, RRP£20 The best of a recent wave of books by leading neuroscientists on the state of contemporary brain research. Ramachandran draws on case histories of people with neural abnormalities to demonstrate the amazing extent to which different areas of the brain interact and even take over each other's functions. Rat Island: Predators in Paradise and the World's Greatest Wildlife Rescue, by William Stolzenburg, Bloomsbury, RRP£12.99 A gripping natural history book about the mass extinction of island species that followed the introduction of alien predators by human settlers. Stolzenburg focuses on the campaign that has gathered pace over the past 50 years to exterminate the invaders, particularly rats and mice, and give the remaining native animals and birds a chance of recovery. Clive Cookson, FT science editor ........................................................................................................................ Sport The Football Men: Up Close with the Giants of the Modern Game, by Simon Kuper, Simon & Schuster, RRP£16.99 Many of the pieces in this collection have appeared before, in the FT and other publications, but taken together Kuper's insightful portraits of top players, such as Ibrahimovic and Iniesta, and managers, including Mourinho and Wenger, form a gossipy, emphatic gallery of modern masters. Racing Through the Dark: The Fall and Rise of David Millar, by David Millar, Orion, RRP£18.99 In 2004, the British cyclist David Millar had a €1m annual contract with a leading French team and a playboy lifestyle to match. When he was busted for performance-enhancing drugs and ended up in jail, he knew he would lose it all. In this vivid first-person account Millar not only reveals his personal descent but the jaw-dropping scale on which doping took place. A Life Too Short: The Tragedy of Robert Enke, by Ronald Reng, Yellow Jersey, RRP£16.99 The German goalkeeper Robert Enke represented his country and was good enough to be signed by Barcelona. So why did he lie down on a railway line in front of the Hamburg-to-Bremen express? Reng, a journalist and novelist who knew Enke, has written a clear-eyed account of the anxieties and depression that blighted a sportsman's existence. High Strung: Björn Borg, John McEnroe and the Untold Story of Tennis's Fiercest Rivalry, by Stephen Tignor, HarperCollins, RRP£14.99 The baseline-hogging Borg and the attacking American McEnroe had very different styles on court but, as tennis writer Tignor's portrait reveals, the blond Swede was not carved from ice. Nor was his opponent always a crybaby. The contest between the two, however, was undoubtedly the real thing. Neil O'Sullivan, FT Life & Arts deputy editor ........................................................................................................................ Art The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso and the Parisian Avant-Garde, edited by Janet Bishop, Cecile Debray and Rebecca Rabinow, Yale, RRP£50 No collectors had greater impact on modern art than the passionate, lofty, squabbling trio Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein. With Michael's wife Sarah they provided pivotal support for Matisse and Picasso, and assembled a stellar array of works. This magnificent, revealing volume accompanies the important exhibition currently in Paris, moving to New York in 2012. The History of the Saatchi Gallery, Booth-Clibborn Editions, RRP£85 A deluxe, updated edition, newly introduced by Edward Booth-Clibborn, of this century's most significant contemporary art book. So influential has Saatchi been as collector-curator that his taste became world taste; the 700 works illustrated, from among thousands he has owned since the 1970s, tell this mesmerising tale, amplified by incisive essays from Norman Rosenthal and scorner-turned-admirer Brian Sewell. Snapshot: Painters and Photography, Bonnard to Vuillard, edited by Elizabeth W Easton, Yale, RRP£35 Photography and painting, that two-centuries-old love-hate relationship, endlessly fascinates and continually changes. This revelatory account of the post-impressionists' use of the Kodak, which is a catalogue to a show now in Amsterdam before touring America in 2012, is an essential contribution to photography's history. De Kooning: A Retrospective, by John Elderfield, Thames & Hudson, RRP£48 My art book of the year: the stunning catalogue to the New York Museum of Modern Art's current Willem de Kooning retrospective is as beautiful and fresh as it is scholarly and comprehensive. The coup is to illustrate not only works in the exhibition but hundreds more, confirming de Kooning without rival as America's most important 20th-century artist. To Pieces, by Henry Parland, translated by Dinah Cannell, Norvik Press, RRP£9.95 Russian-Swedish Henry Parland died of scarlet fever, aged 22. His wonderfully original novella, published in 1932 and now translated into English, is structured around images of photographic fragments, negatives and developing processes, and demonstrates intensely the impact of photography on European modernist culture. An erudite stocking filler. Degas and the Nude, by George TM Shackelford and Xavier Rey, Thames & Hudson, RRP£42 Sexy, lush but serious: how the great French impressionist developed the nude from classical figure to everyday woman stepping out of the bath. An introductory interview with Lucian Freud is sparky; everything whets the appetite for a show of Degas nudes in Paris next spring. Art Nouveau, by Norbert Wolf, Prestel, RRP£50 Tall, narrow, with an elegant linear design like that of the aesthetic it celebrates, this book is a gorgeous object, with top-quality reproductions. Norbert Wolf's commentary is provocative, broad and deep, illuminating links between artists, architects and designers as diverse as Munch and Mondrian, Gaudí and Gallé. The Art Museum, Phaidon, RRP£125 Does size matter? Memento of our gluttonous age, publishing's answer to internet virtual art, although intellectually insubstantial, this monumental tome (weight: 12kg) astounds and amuses for sheer ambition, chutzpah and range: frescos to videos, Terracotta Army to Aztecs, Tang tombs to Jeff Koons - but no Cézanne ""Mont Sainte-Victoire"". Jackie Wullschlager, FT art critic ....................................................................... Martin Wolf, FT chief economics commentator Over the past four decades, economists came to the view that markets were both rational and efficient. Neither belief is correct. In their thought-provoking Beyond Mechanical Markets: Asset Price Swings, Risk, and the Role of the State (Princeton), Roman Frydman and Michael Goldberg explain that our ideas about markets and the economy continually evolve and demonstrate how this can generate huge and destabilising swings in market prices. The book, like our knowledge, is imperfect. But it explores a topic of great importance and makes sensible policy suggestions. Esther Duflo, Professor of economics, MIT Aman Sethi's A Free Man (Random House India) is a beautiful work of journalism, sympathetic and graceful. The author follows, and progressively befriends, a homeless day labourer in Delhi. What starts as classic ethnography becomes a gripping story, and ends as a homage to a lost friend. Mohamed El-Erian, Chief executive and co-chief investment officer of Pimco Over the years, I have found Thomas Friedman's writings to be insightful and influential. In That Used to be Us: What Went Wrong with America - and How it Can Come Back (Little, Brown), Friedman and his co-author Michael Mandelbaum demonstrate their ability to deal with complex issues in a highly accessible and relevant manner. Thanks to their skilful linking of economics and politics, I now better understand the challenges America faces and what it will take to restore her dynamism, self-confidence and important global role. Chris Patten, Chairman of the BBC Trust and chancellor of Oxford University Boomerang: The Meltdown Tour (Allen Lane) by Michael Lewis is a funny if scary description of financial disaster tourism, through Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and California. It would be even more hilarious were it not for the difficulty of thinking of any way out of the ghastly current economic mess. ....................................................................... Music A Singer's Notebook, by Ian Bostridge, Faber, RRP£16.99 A slender but thought-provoking volume of essays by the tenor Ian Bostridge, ranging from his obsessive interest in phlegm - that's as in spit, not stoicism - to a lecture he gave exploring music's links with magic, interpreting Handel's operas through a history of 18th-century witchcraft. Fire and Rain: The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY and the Lost History of 1970, by David Browne, Da Capo, RRP£14.99 Browne, an editor on Rolling Stone magazine, opens his account of 1970 with the soon-to-split Beatles working on Let It Be in January; the book proceeds to follow the year's events through the interlinked stories of three other acts, Simon & Garfunkel, James Taylor and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. The Man Who Sold the World: David Bowie and the 1970s, by Peter Doggett, Bodley Head, RRP£18 One of the best books about the Beatles is Revolution in the Head by Ian MacDonald, which tells their history through a song-by-song analysis of their work. Doggett borrows the template to look at Bowie's chameleonic passage through the 1970s, the arch-negotiator of an era when the conflicts of the 1960s reached their climax. Music for Silenced Voices: Shostakovich and His Fifteen Quartets, by Wendy Lesser, Yale, RRP£18.99 Lesser is drawn to Shostakovich's Quartets because she finds in them the free expression of the composer's private self, rather than the public figure who composed larger-scale works for the USSR. Her book elucidates his life through these ""pure"" pieces of music, as opposed to the compromises of his Soviet-commissioned work. The Man Who Recorded the World: A Biography of Alan Lomax, by John Szwed, Heinemann, RRP£20 Lomax, the musicologist who helped awaken America to its vibrant vernacular music, especially the blues, is the subject of Szwed's insightful biography, which chooses to concentrate on the political and cultural context of Lomax's work rather than his turbulent personal life of failed marriages and depressive episodes. Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, FT pop critic ........................................................................................................................ Architecture Adjaye, Africa, Architecture: A Photographic Survey of Metropolitan Architecture, 7 Volumes, by David Adjaye, Thames & Hudson, RRP£65 The opposite of most architecture books. Rather than sumptuous, meticulously composed shots of buildings, this is a ramshackle collection of snaps by Tanzanian-born, UK-based architect David Adjaye of his 10-year odyssey around Africa's cities. These seven volumes, collected in a slipcase, form a unique record of a country in which compelling architecture is appearing in extraordinary circumstances. Five Cities, by Rem Koolhaas, Amuti Editions, RRP£20 Released as loose leaflets in a box, inspired by BS Johnson's The Unfortunates (1969), these essays can be read in any order. Rem Koolhaas is still the sharpest writer on cities in a generation, ruthlessly forward-looking and counter-intuitive; this collection encompasses some of his best writing. The simple Bauhaus-geometrical covers are designed by the always reliable graphic designers FUEL. Apple Design, by Ed Sabine Schultz and Ina Grätz, HatjeCantz, RRP£30 Steve Jobs' death prompted endless eulogising. The role of Apple's British designer Jonathan Ive has been barely mentioned yet, arguably more than anyone else, Ive produced the look and utility that has made Apple so desirable. If anyone has ever doubted the value of design, this is the ideal Christmas present - even if it is ironic that the book's own design is so clinically dull. The Phaidon Atlas of 21st-Century World Architecture: Travel Edition, Phaidon, RRP£14.95 This more conveniently sized edition of Phaidon's ridiculously oversized doorstopper of the same name is an elegant universal travel guide. Well-illustrated, meticulously researched and genuinely international, it is small enough to take away with you. The City of London: Architectural Tradition and Innovation in the Square Mile, edited by Nicholas Kenyon, Thames & Hudson, RRP£40 The City, once conservative and staid, is now the most architecturally vibrant part of London, if not always in a good way. Brash commercial architecture is being squeezed into the City's complex web of Roman roads and medieval alleys, producing some of contemporary architecture's most arresting juxtapositions and images. The City is rapidly becoming a museum of modern architecture, boasting works by superstars from across the globe. Edwin Heathcote, FT architecture critic ........................................................................................................................ Film Cinema: The Whole Story, edited by Philip Kemp, Thames & Hudson, RRP£19.95 Another one-volume history of cinema, in an over-supplied corner of the market. Trust Thames & Hudson, though, to deliver gleaming graphics, pithy text and a cine-historical narrative that brings us right up to today: post-9/11 cinema, The Hurt Locker and brave new waves in Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Nightmare Movies: Horror on Screen Since the 1960s, by Kim Newman, Bloomsbury, RRP£30 The perfect road map for modern horror cinema fans. Updating his 1988 book, Newman includes The Silence of the Lambs, The Blair Witch Project and other, newer terror landmarks, discussing and contextualising them with wit, depth and mischievous erudition. Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster, by Stephen Jacobs, Tomahawk, RRP£25 The movie star best known for lumbering and grunting - Frankenstein, The Mummy - was, in reality, an Anglo-Indian gent who adored cricket. This Karloff boasts other surprises including campaigning leftwing sympathies and a non-stop love life. Biographer Jacobs portrays him warmly, readably and in rich detail. Then Again: A Memoir, by Diane Keaton Fourth Estate, RRP£18.99 Just what we wanted from the Annie Hall star, an autobiography as quirky, funny and mannered as her best-known roles. Keaton intersperses her own remembrances with excerpts from her mother's diary - the book is a family memoir too - as well as tantalising sketches of the cinema greats she dated (Woody Allen, Warren Beatty). Nigel Andrews, FT film critic Travel One Man and His Bike, by Mike Carter, Ebury Press, RRP£11.99 Compared to the ever-more contrived quests that have become a mainstay of recent travel writing, Carter's mission is admirably simple. One morning while commuting into central London by bike, he decides he will keep going, right around the entire British coast. He turns out to be a likeable and self-deprecating guide, the gentle comedy of his endeavours concealing a vivid portrait of a Britain rarely seen by many city dwellers. Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest, by Wade Davis, Bodley Head, RRP £25 You would be forgiven for wondering if there was anything left to say about George Mallory and Sandy Irvine's ill-fated 1924 attempt to be the first men to climb Everest. But Davis has managed to produce a fascinating book, studying not just the Himalayan expeditions of the early 1920s but also the climbers' wartime experiences, which, he argues, played a crucial part in their motivation. Wild Coast: Travels on South America's Untamed Edge, by John Gimlette, Profile Books, RRP£15 This is classic armchair escapism - a journey through the jungles of Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana, the domain of ""head-crushing jaguars, strangling snakes, rivers of stingrays and electric eels''. Gimlette, who divides his time between being a barrister in London and an explorer, is a keen-eyed narrator. The Tao of Travel, by Paul Theroux, Hamish Hamilton, RRP£9.99 It attracted some stinging reviews, perhaps from those who had been hoping for something profound and weighty from one of travel writing's biggest beasts. Instead, this anthology, selected by Theroux and including his own work and that of many others, is pure entertainment. Perfect for dipping into after Boxing Day lunch. Great British Pubs, by Adrian Tierney-Jones, Campaign for Real Ale, RRP£14.99 On second thoughts, perhaps this is an even better Boxing Day book. Readers in the UK can use this newly published guide to find their nearest cosy, historic hostelry for a festive pint. Those in other countries will have to make do with enjoying the book, a fascinating celebration of the British pub. Tom Robbins, FT travel editor ........................................................................................................................ Food Blood, Bones & Butter: The Inadvertent Education of a Reluctant Chef, by Gabrielle Hamilton, Chatto & Windus, RRP£12.99 My favourite food book of the past few years, a thrilling and visceral personal memoir of the New York chef. Secrets of Scandinavian Cooking ... Scandilicious, by Signe Johansen, Saltyard Books, RRP£20 If you thought Scandinavian food was all about herring, think again. It is, as they say in the fashion world, so hot right now; as is Johansen, a food anthropologist with a winning style and a great way with a recipe. Bocca, by Jacob Kenedy, Bloomsbury, RRP£30 Bocca di Lupo has been one of the more exciting restaurant openings in the past few years with its updated pan-Italian menu, but with his cookbook Kenedy digs deep into all his influences. This deserves to be up there with the River Café, Moro and Ottolenghi cookbooks as a culinary game-changer. In at the Deep End: Cooking Fish from Venice to Tokyo, by Jake Tilson, Quadrille Publishing, RRP£20 Tilson, designer and food obsessive, documents his personal quest to learn to like fish. A beautiful, lovingly constructed piece of work that draws you in. Testicles: Balls in Cooking and Culture, by Blandine Vie and Giles MacDonogh, Prospect Books, RRP£20 Truly devoted food geeks regularly thank God that Prospect Books still survives to service their needs. A wonderful compilation of recipes, aperçus, historical fact and literary fancy on a single fascinating theme. Food Britannia, by Andrew Webb, Random House Books, RRP£25 Like a gluttonous contemporary William Cobbett, Webb has toured the country talking to food producers old and new. More than a good read, this may well turn out to be an important historical snapshot of the British food scene at the end of a significant decade Tim Hayward, editor of 'Fire and Knives' ....................................................................... Simon Schama, FT contributing editor How do lobsters mate? Aside from ingeniously? If this has been nagging at you all year, then the book for you is Trevor Corson's The Secret Life of Lobsters (Harper Perennial), which is at once brilliant local history and the most peculiar zoological story you'll ever have read. Once you've learnt that highly motivated females turn the males on by issuing clouds of, erm, substances from their heads, you're going to turn into an arthropod cocktail party bore. Likewise, although Paul Greenberg's vividly written Four Fish (Allen Lane) is proof that books that make you rethink what you put into your stomach don't have to be preachy, you're unlikely ever to think about ""Mediterranean Sea Bass"" in the same way again. ....................................................................... Gardening Private Paradise: Contemporary American Gardens, by Charlotte M Frieze, Monacelli Press, RRP$65 This is a handy treasure chest of ideas and a useful crib for anyone thinking of hiring a landscaper. The text is concise and the photographs, some taken by American landscape architect Martha Swartz, instructive.

Lives of the Novelists, by John Sutherland, Profile, RRP£30 The fruit of decades of reading and research, Sutherland's quirky compendium offers selective mini-biographies of 294 English novelists including Jeffrey Archer but not, oddly, Lewis Carroll or PG Wodehouse.

China tycoon slams Iceland over failed land bid,Iceland,"The Chinese tycoon behind a failed plan to buy a huge tract of land in Iceland has blamed prejudice against China for the rejection of the bid, according to an interview published Sunday. Iceland on Friday denied a request by property tycoon Huang Nubo to purchase a 300-square-kilometre (200-square-mile) swathe of land in the northern part of the island for a tourist resort. ""The denial reflects the unjust and parochial investment environment facing private Chinese enterprises abroad,"" Huang, founder of property company Zhongkun Group, said in an interview with the official China Daily newspaper. Huang had asked the Iceland government in late August for permission to buy the land for $10 million, with plans to invest about $200 million to build a resort in the Icelandic wilderness. Some Icelandic observers had suggested Huang's purchase could help China get a foothold in the Arctic region for energy resources and shipping, amid predictions the melting ice cap will make oil and gas deposits more accessible. Speaking at his Beijing office on Saturday after learning of the rejection, Huang said the refusal was a loss for Iceland and Chinese investors. He accused Western countries of being unfair by pressing Beijing to further open its markets while at the same time rejecting the advances of Chinese investors. ""There are still double standards,"" he said, adding that foreign countries ""encourage the opening of the Chinese market while they close their doors to Chinese investments."" In rejecting the request, Iceland's Interior Minister Ogmundur Jonasson said approval would set an unwelcome precedent. ""We are talking about a land purchase on such a large scale that if we had agreed to an exemption one could say that the law was null and void and... that anyone who applied for an exemption after this would be allowed to buy, simply because of such a precedent,"" he said. The refusal was unexpected, coming after Iceland's economic affairs ministry said it was favourable to Huang's plans and recommending the interior ministry approve the request. Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir also said she regretted the decision, describing it as based on ""a very narrow interpretation of the law"", but that it was final and could not be appealed. Since the land is partly owned by the government, approval is required for a non-resident of the European Economic Area to buy it. bxs/sls"

WISH YOU WERE HERE,Iceland,"TOURISM bosses in Glasgow know there is only one way to get people to come to the city – go out and tell them what it has to offer. That’s why the city’s marketing chiefs are working in France, Spain, Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands spreading the news. Tourism is big business and those five countries alone generate a quarter of the foreign visitors who jet into Scotland’s biggest city every year. And together they spend a whopping £60million on accommodation, food, drink, shopping and nightlife. That’s a lot of money and Glasgow City Marketing Bureau would like more to boost the local economy. For that reason Glasgow’s tourism chiefs launched international marketing and communications campaigns last month in a twin effort to boost visitor numbers and support new air routes to the city. They have turned the spotlight on Glasgow’s rich tapestry of cultural attractions, major events, conference facilities and new hotels, as well as the key developments taking place as the city prepares to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Scottish music was used to woo journalists in the Netherlands when marketing chiefs arrived at the Lloyd Hotel in Amsterdam to profile easyJet’s new direct flights between the Dutch capital and Glasgow and the new Scottish Hydro Arena at the SECC. Mull singer-songwriter Sorren Maclean and Oban guitarist and singer Finlay Wells – known in musical circles as the Deadly Duo – entertained the media fresh from their appearance at Celtic Connections. The Netherlands is Glasgow’s eighth biggest foreign market. It’s estimated that 22,000 Dutch tourists come to the city every year and spend an average of £9.2m. The Spanish also love Glasgow, with 44,000 jetting to the city every year, and spending £23m. Marketing chiefs joined VisitScotland to bring writers from four Spanish media publications – with a combined 1.2 million readers – to Glasgow. Among the attractions highlighted were Jet2.com’s flights to Barcelona which begin next month and Air Nostrum’s twice-weekly flights between Glasgow and Madrid. And it wasn’t just Scots who flocked to Celtic Connections. Writers from five French fashion, lifestyle and travel magazines – with more than seven million readers – were flown in for the cultural celebration. The marketing bureau also promoted direct flights between Glasgow and France, including easyJet’s service to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Jet2.com’s links with Nice Cote d’Azur. Press advertisements are also planned in the coming weeks. Each year more than 61,000 tourists from France flock to Scotland’s biggest city, where they spend an estimated £18.4m. And Glasgow is currently being heavily marketed on the radio, in the media and online across Norway now that Eastern Airways has launched direct flights to Stavanger. Glasgow attracts 17,000 Norwegians every year who bring more than £7m into the city’s economy. Iceland is also about to get the VIP treatment with the launch of a “seeglasgow” website and TV and radio adverts after the bureau’s communications team jetted to the capital Reykjavik last month for the annual Mid-Atlantic Seminar. The event, organised by airline Icelandair, attracts more than 300 delegates from the travel industry in Europe and North America. During the year, bureau bosses will also be focusing on America, Canada and Germany, as well as Australia and New Zealand and the oil-rich Arabs of Dubai. The groundwork has already started. Canadian celebrity chef Massimo Capra has visited Glasgow to film a new Canadian TV series, Gourmet Escapes. Dubbed Canada’s Jamie Oliver, he teamed up with Glasgow chef Colin Clydesdale of West End restaurants Ubiquitous Chip and Stravaigin to discover the city’s culinary offerings. The show, to be broadcast later this year, is expected to be watched by 8.5m viewers. The drive to bring more tourists to Glasgow has the wholehearted backing of city council leader Gordon Matheson, who is also bureau chairman. He said: “These are tremendously exciting times for Glasgow with major new infrastructure and hotel developments ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games providing the city with the materials to generate significant in-bound tourism and inward investment. “It remains as important as ever that the story of Glasgow’s regeneration and metamorphosis into one of Europe’s most vibrant and stylish cities is told and it is Glasgow City Marketing Bureau’s role to ensure that this story is communicated to a global audience. “Cities across Europe are facing challenging and difficult times at present, which is why it has never been more important that Glasgow occupies its place on the global stage as one of the world’s great cities.” gordon.thomson@ eveningtimes.co.uk"
The Possibility of an Island,Iceland,"''You want to know why I am the way I am?'' Zita Cobb asked. She's a slender woman in her early 50s, with close cropped hair that gives her a certain iron-pixie mien. She has the distinct composure one often finds in people who've done well in the business world, brisk good humor layered over a fierce intensity. She was speaking in her office in a small building on Fogo Island, a freckle of land that lies off the northeast corner of Newfoundland, Canada, with a population of 2,700 or so scattered across a series of fishing communities with names like Seldom, Joe Batt's Arm and Tilting. It's a place so singular and remote that it has its own peculiar time zone, 1.5 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time -- though in truth it feels like it's hundreds of years behind: when it's 10 p.m. in New York, it's 1825 on Fogo Island. Cobb was born here. ''When I was 5, I had TB,'' she says. ''We didn't have a hospital, but the Christmas Seal boat came around, everybody lined up on the dock, and you got a chest X-ray. So I had to go away for a year, and I was in a sanatorium. For that whole year I never saw anyone in my family. I think I came out of that fully independent. When my father came to get me I remember looking at this man and thinking, 'Who the frick is that?' '' He was a fisherman, as were most of the people on Fogo Island at the time, and the world he brought her back to was astounding in its seclusion. Overhead there were astronauts orbiting the earth. On the island, there was no electricity, no telephones or radios. Her parents, who could neither read nor write, raised her and her six brothers in a 900-square-foot house, where they'd pursued a life of semi-subsistence virtually identical to their forebears. No land deeds, no bank accounts, for that matter no cash: they sold their fish to merchants for credit in a company store, and everything else they needed they made themselves. Cobb showed me a picture of her mother as a girl, taken some time in the early 1940s. ''I really don't think that they knew there was a war on,'' she said. ''How would they know?'' Her ancestors had arrived straight from Ireland and England and started fishing. Newfoundlanders call these minuscule fishing villages ''outports,'' which gives them an apt air of edge-of-the-known. Getting to Fogo Island still isn't easy; it typically entails several flights, a 60-mile drive, a 45-minute ferry and then another drive. Staying there is an exercise in anachronism. There are no fast food outlets on the island, only one bank, no movie theaters or malls, and if there was a neon sign anywhere I didn't see it. The houses all face the North Atlantic, cold and seemingly endless. Circling around the island's many bays and inlets (it's about 4 times the size of Manhattan, with about 50 miles of paved road), one grows used to looking at the picture-book little towns from across a half mile or so of water. On clear days the light bounces freely across the distance, and the buildings appear so sharply etched you'd think you could reach out and touch them. When the clouds come in, everything seems to dissolve into mist and vapors. In spring, spectacular blue-white icebergs drift lazily past the harbors, occasionally letting out growls and groans as they calve. Time is different; history foreshortened. Irish and English accents still poke up through local speech (''Would you like some oiwce, dere, Jim?'' a local man said to me. Some what? ''Some oiwce. From de oiwceberg.'') Anglican and Catholic and a few other houses of worship dominate the landscape; directions invariably begin with, ''Well, you go down to the church. . . .'' The small graveyards scattered around are full of surnames you recognize: the man who owns your B&B;, the girl who works in a local restaurant. It's a land out of time, or it was, until time took it back in, and a single edict devastated the place as swiftly and completely as Katrina devastated New Orleans. The outports were based on the cod industry, but the cod were disappearing, so in 1992 the Canadian government declared a moratorium on fishing, and just like that, Fogo Island, and hundreds of outports just like it, simply collapsed. By then, Cobb had left the island to get an undergraduate business degree in Ottawa; she'd worked for an oil company in Alberta, then for a firm that specialized in cold-weather engineering. In 1988, she quit and spent six months traveling through Africa; the next year, she joined the fiber optics company JDS Fitel (JDS merged with the American company Uniphase), and in time she was promoted to C.F.O. By 2000, she was the third-highest-paid female executive on American payrolls; in 2002, the year she cashed out, she made about four times as much as she'd made in 2000. She spent several years sailing around the world, and eventually made her way back, as many native sons and daughters do, to Fogo Island: one of the richest women in Canada, returning to one of its poorest communities. Her plan was simply to take a break from her travels, but she returned to an island that had fallen into desuetude. Her first response was to set up a few scholarships, but one night she was buttonholed by a local mother. (Fogo Island women are nothing if not direct.) ''Oh, it's all really fine what you're doing,'' the woman said. ''But you do realize that you're just paying our children to leave, don't you? You look smart enough. Can't you do something to make jobs?'' It's a simple question that people are grappling with in small towns everywhere, from the Gulf Coast to Nebraska. ''Rural renewal'' is a far less common term than its urban counterpart, but the problem is just as pressing, and in many ways similar: a community with vivid traditions and a struggling population gets hit by a disaster -- economic, natural, political or all three -- and has to decide how to recreate itself without becoming soulless and bland. Fogo Island has a curious advantage. It's historically and geographically isolated; its population is small, homogeneous and for the most part fixed; its economy is simple; and Cobb had the resources to make an open-ended financial commitment. There are few variables to control for, no wild cards to keep at bay. All she had to do was invert the old maxim: Teach them not to fish, and she'd feed them for a lifetime. So she went C.F.O. on the place. She set up a foundation with her brother Tony called Shorefast (the name comes from a line used to fix cod traps to the shore), putting up millions of her own money and getting matching grants from various Canadian agencies; she started thinking and planning. The morning after I arrived on the island, she gave me a presentation: there was a section on the island's berries; maps, quotes, photographs, invocations and exhortations; brief histories of cod fishing, of local cuisine, quilting and boat-building; descriptions of microfinance initiatives, and topping it all off, a project consisting of six art studios, scattered around the island, along with a smart new hotel to house visitors. Cobb had cataloged all the local knowledge she could find, and used it to build a complex array of projects: restaurants, a library, furniture, boat races, oceanic studies, astronomy, theater, art galleries. There seems to be little she hasn't thought of. Consider, for example, the punts: small wooden rowboats that once dotted the harbor. One day, Cobb's brother pointed out to her that there were only a handful of people on the island who still knew how to build them, and they were getting along in years. ''Do you realize we're eight funerals away from never being able to build another punt on Fogo Island?'' he said. So Tony set up a punt-building program and, to keep the effort from becoming irrelevant, established a yearly race between Fogo Island and nearby Change Islands, a solution both ingenious and extremely popular. Whether the rest of her plans will prove as effective remains to be seen. As it stands, the project is in medias res: four of the six studios have been built, and the Inn itself should be finished by November. All of them were designed by Todd Saunders, an up-and-coming architect who's as close to local as it's possible to get. Born and raised in Gander, the nearest town with an airport, he now lives in Norway. But like so many Newfoundlanders, what he wanted most was an excuse to go back home. When Cobb first contacted him, on his cellphone as he was kayaking in a fjord, he said he blurted out, ''I was waiting for this call. '' It was an unusual commission. ''I had to make modern architecture the way a Newfoundlander would,'' Saunders said. ''Scandinavian design has a refinement to it, but Tilting's got this ugly beauty.'' To an outsider, Tilting, like the other towns, is more jolie than laide, but it has simplicity and consistency. If there's been any new residential construction on the island in a century, you wouldn't know it, and the buildings that exist look much like what you'd get if you asked a 6-year-old to draw a house. The greatest risk for an architect who wants to build there is, well, architecture: a structure that seems too designed would have looked silly, at best, and insulting at worst. On this count, the studios are very well done indeed: they're small, rough-hewn buildings, almost as simple as their neighbors but with forms and touches that keep them from seeming pious or perfunctory. The two-story Tower Studio, a vertical building at the end of a narrow boardwalk, has twists in it that makes it refractory, like a jewel made out of wood; the Bridge Studio looks like someone broke off a piece of a SoHo loft and fixed it on a hillside; and the Squish Studio, which sits on a rocky promontory, has a view so dominated by water that it feels like a wheelhouse. The Inn is the largest of Saunders's projects, and perhaps most difficult to get right. When it's done, it will contain more than 40,000 square feet of floor space, spread over four stories -- considerably larger than any other building on the island. There'll be 29 rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows, nested on top of various public spaces, all gathered in a subtly X-shaped building that sits on a promontory outside of Joe Batt's Arm. So far, it's cost $20 million -- probably as much as it would cost to buy every other building on the island -- and when it's done it will belong to Shorefast. Whether it will dwarf the community or crown it is hard to say; Cobb herself makes nervous jokes about its size, but it's bound to be a spectacular place to stay. The Inn will bring the tourists, and most of the money, but according to Cobb, art is the key to Fogo's reinvention, not because it comes with cash, but because it comes with consciousness, with communal self-knowledge and a sense of possibility. Accordingly, the studios are scattered around the island; the idea is not for artists to mix with each other, but to place them in the towns and see what happens. With little feel for art herself, Cobb hired Elisabet Gunnarsdottir, an Icelandic woman with a background in design and arts administration, to set up a semi-autonomous organization called the Fogo Island Arts Corporation. ''This place was dying, really,'' Gunnarsdottir told me. ''But one of the things I love about this project is that this is not us coming in as saviors: 'Here we are, we know it all, listen to us.' We have to create something new, modern, for the future. But how do we do it so that there's a continuation, there's a link with the past?'' If you ask the islanders what, in fact, they want and expect, you get a host of contradictory answers. Like Newfoundlanders in general, they're at once proud, somewhat inward and unusually welcoming of visitors. And they're profoundly attached to the place, if frustrated by its penury. The result is something like the Amish rumspringa: young people often leave, usually to work in Alberta, but a surprising number end up coming back. That sort of push-me-pull-you attitude extends deep into the culture. One woman I spoke to spent the first half of our conversation expressing her reservations about outsiders moving onto the island, if only because it meant things were going to be different, and the second half bemoaning the fact that if she wanted to stop by a Wal-Mart to pick up some basic goods, she had to take the ferry to the mainland. Did she want a Wal-Mart on the island, then? Of course not, she said. But when I pointed out the contradiction -- she didn't want the world coming to her, but she was tired of having to go meet the world -- she changed the subject. Few people I talked to were willing to come out and say that they have any problem with Cobb's plans. But they'll readily report that other people do. Some people, one hears, ask why she brought quilting experts from off the island to hold a class, when they know perfectly well how to quilt, and have for centuries. Some people complain that the price of housing has already gone up considerably, and this in a community so closely held that people only recently got deeds to their properties. Some people are irked that she hasn't built, say, a swimming pool instead of all those artists' studios. After all, the studios aren't for the locals, and in the meantime there's no place for children to learn how to swim. Cobb has worries of her own: the possibility that Fogo Islanders would become too dependent upon her; that somehow she was tampering with the scale of the place; that there was so much these people -- her people -- had to learn about getting by in the modern world, and so little time for them to learn it; that the project would fail altogether, or succeed too well and become overrun by tourists. She was worried that she wouldn't live to see her work on its feet -- her parents and two of her brothers died young. ''I come from a family of people who don't live very long,'' she pointed out. Above all, she was worried about doing right by the place. ''If this goes bad, I'm going to have a bad life,'' she told me. ''You know that graveyard I showed you last night? My parents would get out of that and wring my neck.'' She was quite serious about the first remark. I half suspected she believed the second one, too. It's too soon to tell, but I think her folks are going to be able to rest in peace. One evening I attended an impromptu song swap in a church in Joe Batt's Arm. There were about 50 people there, among them several Norwegian performers and some theater students from Canada's National Arts Center, all of whom were on the island for an Ibsen festival. About a dozen people got up to sing, mostly folk songs from wherever they were from. Cobb sat in the circle alongside three local women, slouching a bit and looking effectively anonymous, even when her turn came to join her partners in an old Fogo Island song. It was a backward-looking performance in a forward-looking environment, and everyone enjoyed it. Reflecting on it afterward, I was reminded of something Cobb had dropped into one of our first conversations, a remark that she got from Giuseppe di Lampedusa's ''The Leopard.'' If she can convince her fellow islanders of its truth, she has a good shot at accomplishing everything she's working for. ''If you want things to stay the same,'' she'd said, ''they have to change.'' ESSENTIALS Fogo Island Fogo Island remains isolated and, at least until the Inn opens this November, short on amenities. To get there fly into Gander, Newfoundland, rent a car, and then drive 60 or so miles to Farewell to catch the ferry, which leaves every 4 hours or so (though if your flight gets in very late, as many do, you'll have to spend the night in Gander). Once on the island, there are four or five B&B;'s, including Foley's, which was quite nice. For lunch and dinner, Nicole's Cafe in Joe Batt's Arm is the place. You may find yourself eating there twice a day for the entirety of your stay, though their affiliated ice cream shop, Growler's, is just down the road, and serves soup and sandwiches in the winter. There's also a curious Chinese restaurant called Kwang Tung in the town of Fogo (on Garrison Road). The Town of Fogo Island's Web site has several useful links. For information on events on the island, check Shorefast's Web site, or that of the Arts Corporation.

The Possibility of an Island,Iceland,"""You want to know why I am the way I am?"" Zita Cobb asked. She’s a slender woman in her early 50s, with close cropped hair that gives her a certain iron-pixie mien. She has the distinct composure one often finds in people who’ve done well in the business world, brisk good humor layered over a fierce intensity. She was speaking in her office in a small building on Fogo Island, a freckle of land that lies off the northeast corner of Newfoundland, Canada, with a population of 2,700 or so scattered across a series of fishing communities with names like Seldom, Joe Batt’s Arm and Tilting. It’s a place so singular and remote that it has its own peculiar time zone, 1.5 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time — though in truth it feels like it’s hundreds of years behind: when it’s 10 p.m. in New York, it’s 1825 on Fogo Island. Cobb was born here. “When I was 5, I had TB,” she says. “We didn’t have a hospital, but the Christmas Seal boat came around, everybody lined up on the dock, and you got a chest X-ray. So I had to go away for a year, and I was in a sanatorium. For that whole year I never saw anyone in my family. I think I came out of that fully independent. When my father came to get me I remember looking at this man and thinking, ‘Who the frick is that?’ ” He was a fisherman, as were most of the people on Fogo Island at the time, and the world he brought her back to was astounding in its seclusion. Overhead there were astronauts orbiting the earth. On the island, there was no electricity, no telephones or radios. Her parents, who could neither read nor write, raised her and her six brothers in a 900-square-foot house, where they’d pursued a life of semi-subsistence virtually identical to their forebears. No land deeds, no bank accounts, for that matter no cash: they sold their fish to merchants for credit in a company store, and everything else they needed they made themselves. Cobb showed me a picture of her mother as a girl, taken some time in the early 1940s. “I really don’t think that they knew there was a war on,” she said. “How would they know?” Her ancestors had arrived straight from Ireland and England and started fishing. Newfoundlanders call these minuscule fishing villages “outports,” which gives them an apt air of edge-of-the-known. Getting to Fogo Island still isn’t easy; it typically entails several flights, a 60-mile drive, a 45-minute ferry and then another drive. Staying there is an exercise in anachronism. There are no fast food outlets on the island, only one bank, no movie theaters or malls, and if there was a neon sign anywhere I didn’t see it. The houses all face the North Atlantic, cold and seemingly endless. Circling around the island’s many bays and inlets (it’s about 4 times the size of Manhattan, with about 50 miles of paved road), one grows used to looking at the picture-book little towns from across a half mile or so of water. On clear days the light bounces freely across the distance, and the buildings appear so sharply etched you’d think you could reach out and touch them. When the clouds come in, everything seems to dissolve into mist and vapors. In spring, spectacular blue-white icebergs drift lazily past the harbors, occasionally letting out growls and groans as they calve. Time is different; history foreshortened. Irish and English accents still poke up through local speech (“Would you like some oiwce, dere, Jim?” a local man said to me. Some what? “Some oiwce. From de oiwceberg.”) Anglican and Catholic and a few other houses of worship dominate the landscape; directions invariably begin with, “Well, you go down to the church. . . .” The small graveyards scattered around are full of surnames you recognize: the man who owns your B&B;, the girl who works in a local restaurant. It’s a land out of time, or it was, until time took it back in, and a single edict devastated the place as swiftly and completely as Katrina devastated New Orleans. The outports were based on the cod industry, but the cod were disappearing, so in 1992 the Canadian government declared a moratorium on fishing, and just like that, Fogo Island, and hundreds of outports just like it, simply collapsed. By then, Cobb had left the island to get an undergraduate business degree in Ottawa; she’d worked for an oil company in Alberta, then for a firm that specialized in cold-weather engineering. In 1988, she quit and spent six months traveling through Africa; the next year, she joined the fiber optics company JDS Fitel (JDS merged with the American company Uniphase), and in time she was promoted to C.F.O. By 2000, she was the third-highest-paid female executive on American payrolls; in 2002, the year she cashed out, she made about four times as much as she’d made in 2000. She spent several years sailing around the world, and eventually made her way back, as many native sons and daughters do, to Fogo Island: one of the richest women in Canada, returning to one of its poorest communities. Her plan was simply to take a break from her travels, but she returned to an island that had fallen into desuetude. Her first response was to set up a few scholarships, but one night she was buttonholed by a local mother. (Fogo Island women are nothing if not direct.) “Oh, it’s all really fine what you’re doing,” the woman said. “But you do realize that you’re just paying our children to leave, don’t you? You look smart enough. Can’t you do something to make jobs?” It’s a simple question that people are grappling with in small towns everywhere, from the Gulf Coast to Nebraska. “Rural renewal” is a far less common term than its urban counterpart, but the problem is just as pressing, and in many ways similar: a community with vivid traditions and a struggling population gets hit by a disaster — economic, natural, political or all three — and has to decide how to recreate itself without becoming soulless and bland. Fogo Island has a curious advantage. It’s historically and geographically isolated; its population is small, homogeneous and for the most part fixed; its economy is simple; and Cobb had the resources to make an open-ended financial commitment. There are few variables to control for, no wild cards to keep at bay. All she had to do was invert the old maxim: Teach them not to fish, and she’d feed them for a lifetime. So she went C.F.O. on the place. She set up a foundation with her brother Tony called Shorefast (the name comes from a line used to fix cod traps to the shore), putting up millions of her own money and getting matching grants from various Canadian agencies; she started thinking and planning. The morning after I arrived on the island, she gave me a presentation: there was a section on the island’s berries; maps, quotes, photographs, invocations and exhortations; brief histories of cod fishing, of local cuisine, quilting and boat-building; descriptions of microfinance initiatives, and topping it all off, a project consisting of six art studios, scattered around the island, along with a smart new hotel to house visitors. Cobb had cataloged all the local knowledge she could find, and used it to build a complex array of projects: restaurants, a library, furniture, boat races, oceanic studies, astronomy, theater, art galleries. There seems to be little she hasn’t thought of. Consider, for example, the punts: small wooden rowboats that once dotted the harbor. One day, Cobb’s brother pointed out to her that there were only a handful of people on the island who still knew how to build them, and they were getting along in years. “Do you realize we’re eight funerals away from never being able to build another punt on Fogo Island?” he said. So Tony set up a punt-building program and, to keep the effort from becoming irrelevant, established a yearly race between Fogo Island and nearby Change Islands, a solution both ingenious and extremely popular. Whether the rest of her plans will prove as effective remains to be seen. As it stands, the project is in medias res: four of the six studios have been built, and the Inn itself should be finished by November. All of them were designed by Todd Saunders, an up-and-coming architect who’s as close to local as it’s possible to get. Born and raised in Gander, the nearest town with an airport, he now lives in Norway. But like so many Newfoundlanders, what he wanted most was an excuse to go back home. When Cobb first contacted him, on his cellphone as he was kayaking in a fjord, he said he blurted out, “I was waiting for this call. ” It was an unusual commission. “I had to make modern architecture the way a Newfoundlander would,” Saunders said. “Scandinavian design has a refinement to it, but Tilting’s got this ugly beauty.” To an outsider, Tilting, like the other towns, is more jolie than laide, but it has simplicity and consistency. If there’s been any new residential construction on the island in a century, you wouldn’t know it, and the buildings that exist look much like what you’d get if you asked a 6-year-old to draw a house. The greatest risk for an architect who wants to build there is, well, architecture: a structure that seems too designed would have looked silly, at best, and insulting at worst. On this count, the studios are very well done indeed: they’re small, rough-hewn buildings, almost as simple as their neighbors but with forms and touches that keep them from seeming pious or perfunctory. The two-story Tower Studio, a vertical building at the end of a narrow boardwalk, has twists in it that makes it refractory, like a jewel made out of wood; the Bridge Studio looks like someone broke off a piece of a SoHo loft and fixed it on a hillside; and the Squish Studio, which sits on a rocky promontory, has a view so dominated by water that it feels like a wheelhouse. The Inn is the largest of Saunders’s projects, and perhaps most difficult to get right. When it’s done, it will contain more than 40,000 square feet of floor space, spread over four stories — considerably larger than any other building on the island. There’ll be 29 rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows, nested on top of various public spaces, all gathered in a subtly X-shaped building that sits on a promontory outside of Joe Batt’s Arm. So far, it’s cost $20 million — probably as much as it would cost to buy every other building on the island — and when it’s done it will belong to Shorefast. Whether it will dwarf the community or crown it is hard to say; Cobb herself makes nervous jokes about its size, but it’s bound to be a spectacular place to stay. The Inn will bring the tourists, and most of the money, but according to Cobb, art is the key to Fogo’s reinvention, not because it comes with cash, but because it comes with consciousness, with communal self-knowledge and a sense of possibility. Accordingly, the studios are scattered around the island; the idea is not for artists to mix with each other, but to place them in the towns and see what happens. With little feel for art herself, Cobb hired Elisabet Gunnarsdottir, an Icelandic woman with a background in design and arts administration, to set up a semi-autonomous organization called the Fogo Island Arts Corporation. “This place was dying, really,” Gunnarsdottir told me. “But one of the things I love about this project is that this is not us coming in as saviors: ‘Here we are, we know it all, listen to us.’ We have to create something new, modern, for the future. But how do we do it so that there’s a continuation, there’s a link with the past?” If you ask the islanders what, in fact, they want and expect, you get a host of contradictory answers. Like Newfoundlanders in general, they’re at once proud, somewhat inward and unusually welcoming of visitors. And they’re profoundly attached to the place, if frustrated by its penury. The result is something like the Amish rumspringa: young people often leave, usually to work in Alberta, but a surprising number end up coming back. That sort of push-me-pull-you attitude extends deep into the culture. One woman I spoke to spent the first half of our conversation expressing her reservations about outsiders moving onto the island, if only because it meant things were going to be different, and the second half bemoaning the fact that if she wanted to stop by a Wal-Mart to pick up some basic goods, she had to take the ferry to the mainland. Did she want a Wal-Mart on the island, then? Of course not, she said. But when I pointed out the contradiction — she didn’t want the world coming to her, but she was tired of having to go meet the world — she changed the subject. Few people I talked to were willing to come out and say that they have any problem with Cobb’s plans. But they’ll readily report that other people do. Some people, one hears, ask why she brought quilting experts from off the island to hold a class, when they know perfectly well how to quilt, and have for centuries. Some people complain that the price of housing has already gone up considerably, and this in a community so closely held that people only recently got deeds to their properties. Some people are irked that she hasn’t built, say, a swimming pool instead of all those artists’ studios. After all, the studios aren’t for the locals, and in the meantime there’s no place for children to learn how to swim. Cobb has worries of her own: the possibility that Fogo Islanders would become too dependent upon her; that somehow she was tampering with the scale of the place; that there was so much these people — her people — had to learn about getting by in the modern world, and so little time for them to learn it; that the project would fail altogether, or succeed too well and become overrun by tourists.

NEW EEA GRANTS PROGRAM PRESENTED,Iceland,"TALLINN - After a long haul of planning, the programs for the EEA/Norway Grants for the new 5-year period were presented at a launch meeting in Tallinn this week. The amount to be distributed among Estonian projects is 48 million euros. For the three Baltic countries the total amount is 206 million euros. The programs will soon be presented to the public by the various program operators, inviting organizations and public entities to apply for project support, the EEA Grants secretariat told The Baltic Times. The EEA Grants and Norway Grants were established in connection with the enlargement of the EU in 2004. As non-EU members, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are obliged by the EEA (European Economic Area) agreement to give financial support in order to reduce disparities in the European Economic Area (which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The EEA Grants amount to 988 million euros in the current period and aims to support projects in the 12 newest EU member countries and Greece, Portugal and Spain. Norway contributes around 95 percent of the total funding, with Iceland and Liechtenstein contributing the remaining 5 percent. The Norway Grants represent  800 million euros in the current period. The funding is allocated to the 12 newest EU member states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, and is wholly contributed by Norway. In combination both Grants amount to 1.79 billion euros. The funding is allocated between the receiving countries, based on their population and GDP per capita. For example, Poland will receive 578 million euros and Malta 4.5 million euros. Each country has its special focus areas. For Estonia, environment and public health are the most important focus areas for the 48 million euro allocation. In Latvia and Lithuania the focus areas are environment, adaptation to climate change and cultural heritage, both countries also having substantial allocations in the sectors of justice and home affairs. All three countries focus on civil society through a special fund for non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Of the new programs in Estonia, more than a quarter of the total funding (12.9 million euros) is earmarked for programs on integrated marine and inland water management and green industry innovation. The second largest priority area, public health initiatives, seeks to improve access to and quality of health services. Other programs include research and scholarships, cultural and natural heritage. In Estonia, the Ministry of Finance has the overall responsibility for issuing the grants, but each program is managed by a national program operator who announces the program and evaluates the project applications. “Each funding period is developed in steps. In 2009, the donors negotiated with the EU; country-specific negotiations followed, and in mid-2011 agreements were signed with Estonia. Next Estonia started to prepare its programs, and this is what is being presented during this week’s launch in Tallinn. The funding will run until 2016,” says Sigve Soldal Bjorstad, press contact for the EEA and Norway Grants in Brussels. Norwegian organizations and state institutions will be involved in 10 different programs. Partners from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway will also contribute to a scholarship program. “By facilitating partnerships between important institutions on both sides, such as the cooperation between the Norwegian climate and pollution agency and the Estonian Ministry of Environment, we open up a new dimension of sharing knowledge and experience across borders which both parties will benefit from,” says Bjorstad. Other institutions the Estonian program operators will co-operate with include the Norwegian Cultural Heritage Board, Norwegian Directorate of Health, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and several other institutions. EEA /Norway Grants have so far been distributed to more than 200 projects in Estonia, reports the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the adoption of renewable biofuels in the boiler house of OU Lihula Soojus, was one of many projects completed in Estonia during the last period. The 650,000 euro project, conducted by municipal heating company OU Lihula Soojus and supported with a 50 percent grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, swapped the area’s energy production from oil-shale to straw and wood, reducing estimated CO2 emissions by 98 percent. Former Estonian Minister of Finance Ivari Padar was present at the project’s formal launch. Padar commended Lihula parish for using local fuels as the source for heating. Norway’s Ambassador to Estonia was also present at the event. Renovation of 9-year-old manor houses in rural Estonia succeeded in preserving historical buildings as well as turning them into modern educational and cultural centers for the local communities. The project was supported by the Grants, which were, according to Anton Parn, undersecretary at the Estonian Ministry for Culture, vital in reaching the goals of the project. In addition to the cost-efficiency of combining several functions in the same building, the ‘Forgotten Manors’ have become an annual highlight during the tourist season. Between 2004-09 a total of 1,240 projects, programs and funds to the tune of 1.3 billion euros were supported in 15 countries by the EEA Grants and Norway Grants. Twelve external reviews and evaluations have been commissioned to external consultants, of which 11 have been concluded. Additional reviews and evaluations have been carried out by the beneficiary states.  "
BRITAIN IS STILL RIGHT ABOUT THE FALKLANDS,Iceland,"Thirty years ago tomorrow Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands and for 10 weeks became the occupying power. The decision by Margaret Thatcher to send a naval taskforce to reclaim the islands changed the course of history largely because it ensured she won a crucial general election the following year. It may not have been Britain's finest hour, but it was certainly one of its finer ones. The springboard from the war allowed the prime minister to increase her 1983 majority at a time when her government was looking vulnerable. That in turn gave her the room to push through the reforms of the 1980s that were so important to Britain's revival after the dark years of the 1970s. It also gave the country a much-needed boost. From the Suez fiasco of 1956, through the protracted and soul-sapping troubles in Northern Ireland, our post-war experience had been one of occasional humiliation and the draining away of power. The Falklands war, a clear-cut victory in a cause that most people in Britain considered to be just, changed that. It was, as Major-General Sir Jeremy Moore, commander of the British land forces, said afterwards, echoing Wellington, ""a damn close-run thing"". Had it been lost, the Thatcher era could have come to an abrupt end before it had really started. The Falklands victory changed the nature of British military interventions. Expeditionary conflicts fought in just causes, including the first Gulf war after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the interventions in Sierra Leone, Kosovo and Libya, established a new pattern. Those were swift and successful. Less happy have been the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, however justified the move to eradicate the Afghan base of Al-Queda. Britain may have comprehensively defeated Argentina in 1982, but Buenos Aires maintains its unjustified claim to the islands. When the Falklands were populated by British settlers in 1690 they were uninhabited and Argentina did not exist. It has no more claim to the islands than Britain does to Iceland. The question that has been exercising the military recently has been whether an invasion could be repeated successfully. The islands are now better defended, at a cost of £200m a year to Britain for the garrison. Argentina does not appear to have an appetite for war. Instead it fights an underhand battle, with the co-operation of some Latin American neighbours, to weaken the Falklands' tourism and fishing industries and its embryonic oil sector, attempting to destroy its livelihood. That must stop and the full weight of diplomatic pressure should be applied to Buenos Aires. The islanders have a right to exist and to remain British for as long as they want to."
"Like breath on a mirror; Seven years ago, with 'Finding', Kathleen Jamie broke the mould of nature writing in a series of essays set around the northen and western edges of Scotland. Her, in an extract from her new book, 'Sighlines', she recounts a journey farther afield, throught frozen seas, in search of the Northern Lights",Iceland,"There's no swell to speak of, just little lapping waves, so landing is just a matter of running the Zodiacs up on to the stony beach, allowing us to jump ashore. Not jump exactly: we swing our legs over the sides of the inflatable, and drop down on to the land, ideally between waves. You don't want to get your feet wet, because they'd soon freeze. All along the shoreline lie trinkets of white ice, nudged up by the tide. A shore of ice and bones – people still come hunting here; the top of the beach is strewn with the bleached, butchered skulls and spines of narwhal and seal. Where the beach ends and the vegetation begins, an outboard engine lies abandoned, rusting violently. There's about a dozen of us, from Europe and North America, tourists, still strangers to each other, beginning to get to know each other through polite conversation, getting to know the world a little, if that's what we're doing, such is our privilege. We've been instructed to ""stay behind the gun"". We have a guide, a young Danish biologist, who carries flares to scare them, and a rifle as last resort, in case of aggravated polar bears, but there are no polar bears. ""Polar bears?"" one of the ship's Russian crewmen had shaken his head. ""Huh. They ate the last one years ago."" With an outcrop of smooth bare rock to shelter us, we take off our rucksacks, set aside our cameras and the gun, crouch or sit down, out of the breeze. It's a stern breeze, blowing from the land, but, like everything here, it carries a sense of enormous strength withheld. Once everyone is settled, the guide makes a suggestion: why don't we keep silent, just for a few minutes, sit still and keep quiet, just listen? We have the sea, deceptively calm and blue and serene with icebergs, stretching away eastward under an ashy sky. Below in the bay our ship rides at anchor, looking overcomplicated among the smaller, white tufts of ice which drift soundlessly around it. Though white, the ship looks dirty, too, the way sheep suddenly look dirty when it snows. Behind the ship, the far side of the bay rises to a low brown ridge similar to this, and beyond that ridge is arranged a row of white pinnacles – the tips of icebergs grounded in a hidden inlet. Westward rises a range of brown jagged mountains, and beyond the coastal range there are hints and gleams of something I thought at first was a band of low cloud, but it's ice, maybe the edge of the inland ice cap. The air is extraordinarily clear. That's what we see. What we listen to, though, is silence. Slowly we enter the most extraordinary silence, a radiant silence. It radiates from the mountains, and the ice and the sky, a mineral silence which presses powerfully on our bodies, coming from very far off. It's deep and quite frightening, and makes my mind seem clamorous as a goose. I want to quell my mind, but I think it would take years. I glance at the others. Some people are looking out at the distant land and sea; others have their heads bowed, as if in church. A minute passes, maybe two, maybe five, just the breeze and this powering silence – then a raven flies over. The bird, utterly black and alone in the sky, is heading inland on steady wings. It, too, keeps quiet. They used to navigate by raven, the Vikings, there being no stars visible at such high latitudes in summer. The old sagas say that the Viking settlers of Iceland took ravens. Out of sight of land, wallowing at sea, they would release a raven and watch it climb the air until it was high enough to sight land. Where the raven headed, they followed in their open boats. Maybe ravens had brought them here, too, in their Greenlandic voyages, a thousand years ago. A thousand years. The blink of an eye. Be quiet, I tell myself. Listen to the silence. I take my eye off the raven for a moment, and when I look back it's gone. How long we sit there I don't know. I know only that I'd never heard anything like it, a silence that could dismiss a sound, as wind would dismiss a feather. Five minutes, ten, minutes in a lifetime. Some people say you can never experience true silence, because you come to hear the high whine of your own nerves. That is to say, you hear the very nervous system which allows you to hear at all. Nerves because we are animals, not ice, not rock. Driven by cold and hunger. It's cold, our animal bodies say; best get moving. Keep warm, keep hunting. So, after maybe ten minutes, by some unspoken assent, a movement, a cough, our experience of deep silence is over, and life begins to whip us on our way. We all begin slowly to stand and move downhill, back toward the waiting boats. It's a while before anyone speaks. The icebergs come on down the fjord in a slow cavalcade, one by one, higher than the ship, closer and closer, and every time I think, ""Surely, surely, this time, we're going to collide,"" but always the ship turns aside gracefully, by just a few degrees, and the iceberg glides away to port or starboard. As they pass, they rear above like a building does, all sculpted and white, with fissures of deepest blue, but also they plunge on down underwater, in tilting levels of sapphire, down into the mile–deep waters, where they have their greater existence. The fjord water is choppy and grey, and between icebergs smaller morsels of ice bob along, now a rocking boat, now an angel's wings. These little pieces look like Christmas decorations but when the ship hits one it bangs like an oil drum beaten with a stick. And there are the mountainsides, the fjord walls. I realise I have the scale completely wrong; the scale is vast. On either side of the fjord, mountains rise to pinnacles of 6,000 feet. They look as lifeless as cathedral spires, but I know now there are plants on their lower slopes, leading fugitive lives – animals, too. Small glaciers, some shrivelled far uphill, leave trails of moraine and gravel reaching down to the water. There's a lull, the wind, the engine, and then another iceberg appears, approaching with the hauteur of a huge catwalk model. The next iceberg offers to the ship a ramp as smooth and angled as a ski jump. Just slide right up here, little ship, it seems to say, but the invitation is declined. It passes astern. Then the next appears down the fjord – a preposterous cake, with ink–blue shadows. Then another, the size of a three–storey house, with walls knapped into smooth, hard facets, like flint. Under the water's surface they are a blue you could fall into, as you could have fallen forever into the silence of the morning. It's like some slow delirium, a fantasy you can't shake, but with an undertow of menace. Although we shout when they appear, it's different when they glide past; no one speaks then. The cameras click, but the icebergs give nothing, suggest nothing but a white nihilism. Another iceberg, and another. Some people say you can smell icebergs, that they smell like cucumbers. You can smell icebergs and hear your own nervous system. I don't know. Although they pass slowly and very close, I smell nothing but colossal, witless indifference. Eventually, in the early evening, in a bay safe from icebergs, the anchor goes rattling down. Tufts and bows of white ice drift around the ship. The fjord is wider here, less relentlessly spectacular; there is a different geology. Instead of jagged basalt mountains, we look out on smooth hills of ice–worn rock, with patches of snow. The wind has dropped, the water is tranquil enough to hold the hills' reflections. Soon it will be dark, but in the last of the daylight we watch – the photographers are all out on deck, their lenses trained – a family of seven stolid musk oxen as they trundle slowly over the hillside. The animals are much the same rusty colour as the vegetation they graze. With downward–curved horns framing their droopy faces, the males look like they're unhappily in drag. They all have a dusting of whitish guard hairs on their shoulders, like frost. We eat and, as night falls, the waters of our anchorage change. I'm leaning over the side, puzzling about the sea 25 feet below. It's become a sluggish eerie green, and suddenly it reminds me of a horrible rubber sheet my mother used to produce, to complete our humiliation, if my sister or brother or I had a phase of bed–wetting. I haven't thought about that sheet for 40 years, but here it is: deep in a fjord in east Greenland at nightfall, at 71 degrees of latitude, undulating around the ship: saltwater, slowly beginning to freeze. Now it's after midnight, and dark. We have been to bed, lain in the dark in our cabins, but are up again, jackets and jerseys thrown over our pyjamas, boots, hats and gloves, and are again standing on the ship's foredeck, eight or ten of us, in twos or alone. Some lean on the rail, some stand in the middle of the deck. There is no electric light; the crew must have switched them off, so there is ship's equipment to negotiate in the darkness, winches and a mast. Although there is no wind now, it's deeply cold and we move with care, because the metal deck underfoot is glazed with ice. If we speak at all, it's in whispers. The land is featureless now, and the water black, but the heavens are vivacious. We are standing with heads tilted back, marvelling. Luminous green, teal green, the aurora borealis glows almost directly overhead. It intensifies against the starry night like breath on a mirror, and it moves. Across the whole sky from east to west, the green lights shift and alter. Now it's an emerald veil, now with a surge it remakes itself into a swizzle which reaches toward some faraway place in the east. We're like an audience – some gaze directly, others have again raised long–lensed cameras – standing in the deep cold, looking up, keeping silence, but it's not a show, it's more like watching fluidity of mind; an intellectualism, after the passivity of icebergs. Not the performance of a finished work but a redrafting and recalculating. In fact, because the aurora's green is exactly the same glowing green as the ship's radar screen, as the readout which gives the latitude and longitude, the aurora looks less like a natural phenomenon, more like a feat of technology. We stand side by side watching, as the green lights close themselves in, then instantly flare out again like a concertina, like people can do who're really skilled at shuffling cards. It's a movement which ought to whoosh, but there is deep silence. There's something in the lights I recognise – a restlessness, a dissatisfaction with their own arrangements. Once more the lights alter and breathe. Someone gasps, then laughs softly and the cameras click. This is an edited extract from Sightlines by Kathleen Jamie (Sort of Books, £8.99) Some people say icebergs smell like cucumers. I don't know I smell nothing but clossalm witless indifference. I had never heard anything like it, a silence that could dismiss a sound, as wind would dismiss a feather"
"China, Iceland announce deal on oil-rich Arctic",Iceland,"China and Iceland announced a deal on the oil-rich Arctic region Friday after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao flew in to Reykjavik on the first stage of a four-nation European tour. The deal was part of a package of six agreements signed on the first day of the Chinese premier's visit to the country, during which he held talks with his Icelandic counterpart Johanna Sigurdardottir. The Arctic's oil reserves were high on the agenda for energy-hungry China during the high-powered delegation's visit to Iceland -- though Sigurdardottir touted the Arctic deal as a research collaboration. ""These agreements will provide various opportunities for increased cooperation on research between Icelandic and Chinese scientists in this area,"" her office said on its website. Iceland's strategic location near the Arctic has not gone unnoticed in China, the world's biggest energy consumer: the shrinking of the polar ice cap is making the region's mineral resources more accessible. The retreat of the ice has also opened up the potential for a shorter cargo shipping route with Asia, which would cut the sea voyage between Shanghai and northern Europe by some 6,400 kilometres (4,000 miles). China's interest in Iceland came to the fore last year when a Chinese property tycoon tried to buy a large swathe of land in the north of the country for a tourism project. Some observers suggested property magnate Huang Nubo's purchase would help China win a foothold in the Arctic, amid general concern over Chinese investment in Europe. That deal was eventually blocked by the Icelandic government, after officials there said China had mooted using the island as a trans-Arctic shipping port. Wen's visit is the first to Iceland by a Chinese premier. Sigurdardottir used the occasion to give Beijing a diplomatic nudge over human rights concerns. Sigurdardottir had ""also discussed human rights issues, civil rights and international commitments,"" her office said. ""The prime minister and premier agreed to enhance relations and cooperation on gender equality in the near future."" Besides the Arctic cooperation agreement, the two sides signed five other accords with 11 ministers and deputy ministers accompanying the Chinese leader. They included agreements on geothermal sciences; marine and polar sciences; geothermal research; and a solar project in Iceland. Iceland's Orka Energy signed a deal with China Petrochemical Corporation of the Sinopec Group on using geothermal energy in China for heating homes and generating electricity. As part of its ambitions in the polar region, Beijing is seeking permanent observer status on the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum promoting cooperation among eight states bordering the region. Those nations include Iceland and Sweden, which Wen is also visiting during his eight-day tour of Europe. The Chinese delegation will also travel to Poland and Germany, where they are expected to discuss the ongoing eurozone crisis. Wen is due to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and attend a China-Germany business summit where both will deliver speeches, Beijing said. str-fc/jhb/jj"
China premier to tour Iceland geothermal plant,Iceland,"Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, a geologist by training, was Saturday to visit Iceland's largest geothermal plant after touring a national park and viewing one of the country's best-known geysers. The premier, who arrived Friday at the start of a European tour which will also take him to Sweden, Poland and Germany, voiced ""strong support"" for moves to develop geothermal energy in his own country after both countries Friday signed a cooperation deal on this issue, Iceland's presidency said. This followed talks between Wen Jiabao and Iceland President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson in which the Chinese leader thanked his host for backing his country's request for permanent observer status on the Artic Council, an eight-country inter-governmental forum. China now has simple observer status on the council which groups Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Canada and the United States. On Saturday, Wen, accompanied by Iceland's Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson, was to visit the Hellisheidarvirkjun geo-thermal plant, on a volcanic ridge near Reykjavik. He earlier toured the Thingvellir national park and saw the Gullfoss falls and the Geysir geyser. China's interest in Iceland came to the fore last year when a Chinese property tycoon tried to buy a large swathe of land in the north of the country for a tourism project.

Chinese PM wraps up Iceland visit,Iceland,"Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao wrapped up a visit to Iceland on Saturday, the first stage in a four-nation European tour, after concluding an accord on cooperation in the oil-rich Arctic region. A geologist by training, Wen visited the Hellisheidarvirkjun geothermal plant on a volcanic ridge near Reykjavik on Saturday, accompanied by Icelandic Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson. China and Iceland have a partnership, through the Orka Energy and Sinopec companies, to develop geothermal energy in China. The premier voiced ""strong support"" for moves to develop geothermal energy in his own country. A day earlier, both countries signed a cooperation deal on the geothermal cooperation, as part of a package of six agreements. Another agreement covered cooperation in the oil-rich Arctic region. The talks, during what is the first visit by a Chinese premier to Iceland, also yielded accords covering cooperation in marine and polar science and technology and solar energy.

China currently has simple observer status on the council grouping Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Canada and the United States. His European tour will also take him to Sweden, Poland and Germany. Skarphedinsson told reporters Friday that Reykavik had always considered China a ""clear"" candidate for permanent observer status on the council. But Grimsson and Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir also said they raised the question of human rights in China with Wen. The president praised Wen's ""reform initiatives"" and said he ""encouraged cooperation and dialogue"" on human rights between Chinese and Islandic intellectuals and organisations. Wen replied that ""the Chinese authorities wanted to support such cooperation and such a dialogue on human rights with the Islandic people,"" the presidency statement said. Hundreds of people attended two demonstrations in Reykjavik on Friday to protest Chinese repression in Tibet and Beijing's crackdown on the Falungong spiritual movement. In an interview Saturday with state radio, Sigurdardottir said: ""I told (Wen) of the importance of human rights issues to the Islandic people. I also told him how I viewed human rights in China."" She added, without elaborating: ""He's a reformer. We know it, and I wasn't disappointed by his response."" The prime minister said Wen had been ""open and positive"" in response to the idea that Iceland could help China in the area of gender equality. Earlier Saturday, Wen toured the Thingvellir national park and saw the Gullfoss falls and the geyser of Geysir -- the origin of the word.

Middle-ground campaigners will lead us into the wilderness,Iceland,"If a man called Darling told you you were ""better together"", you'd be forgiven for assuming he was a relationship councillor. Had you attended the Better Together campaign launch on Monday at Edinburgh's Napier university, you still might not have made the association with preserving the union. Even in this year of diamond jubilee and Olympics, the word ""union"" has been deemed too loaded a term, redolent of Enoch Powell or Tory blue-rinse matrons. In these touchy-feely times, calling a spade anything less than the ace of clubs is not on. The behavioural psychologists had been all over the launch. The terms ""No campaign"" and ""unionist campaign"" — which might have some meaning for voters — have been outlawed. Thus we have the Better Together campaign versus the Yes Scotland campaign. Indeed, so desperate are the two camps to pitch their flagpoles on the middle ground and appeal to all voters, that their websites are incredibly similar. Both promote videos of ""ordinary"" people explaining why they will be voting for or against independence, though the Better Together campaign crew are more ordinary than the Yes Scotland bunch, who include Sir George Mathewson, the Proclaimers and Elaine C Smith. The Better Together campaign has decided to meet head-on Yes Scotland's blatant appeal to Scots' emotions. Both camps plead patriotism and a love of Scotland as the basis of their political message. Both purport to rely on grassroots activism. Both are giving out badges and both used the same music at their launch, much to the annoyance of the band Big Country, who claim they were consulted by neither party. Both insist their campaign is positive and their opponent's negative, though both indulge in slinging mud with one hand while waving with the other. Both campaigns are being led by figureheads who mask the true nature of each organisation. Alistair Darling is the man with his reputation on the line for the Better Together campaign. Yes Scotland relaunched last week following a disaster first time round, which saw the SNP's key ally Patrick Harvie of the Greens abandon the campaign, and has named Dennis Canavan, the retired old Labour MP and MSP turned independent, as its big cheese. Canavan, able though he is, is not the first name that comes to mind when one thinks of independence. To add to the confusion, both campaigns are being run by men called Blair, possibly the most divisive name in politics after Thatcher. Better Together is being coordinated by Blair McDougall, David Miliband's former special adviser, and Yes Scotland has appointed the former head of BBC Scotland news and current affairs, Blair Jenkins. Alex Salmond and David Cameron are nowhere to be seen. The only light relief last week came from Margo MacDonald, who has christened Darling's team ""the abominable No men"". MacDonald — a well-loved, independentminded MSP who is synonymous with independence and who can capture the female vote — should be fronting the Yes Scotland campaign. Instead she has been sidelined. It is early days for both campaigns, of course, but what we have not had so far is any authoritative analysis of the questions. The appeals have been to our brave hearts not our cool heads. What would be the cost of duplicating the parts of the administration currently reserved to Westminster? What sort of foreign policy would an independent Scotland pursue? How would the assets and debt be divided? How would pensions be calculated? If Shetland and Orkney wanted to remain part of the UK while the rest of Scotland became independent, could they? What would happen to the oil revenue then? Post-independence, Scotland would be the 116th smallest country in the world based on population statistics, while the UK would slip from 22nd to 23rd place on the international rankings. Perhaps this doesn't matter — there are plenty of successful small countries — but in a world economy increasingly dominated by the massive Bric nations alongside America, a small country could easily find itself sidelined in the global economy. Last week Alex Salmond addressed the TEDGlobal 2012 conference in Edinburgh. He told some of the world's leading thinkers that the argument for independence was not, fundamentally, an economic one. ""The argument for independence is that Scotland is a nation and nations are better when they govern themselves and nobody is going to take better decisions about Scotland than the people who live in Scotland,"" he said. It's a specious argument. Scotland already has self-government and we have an expensive parliament to prove it. As long as we remain in the European Union — a key component of the SNP's vision — we will have to be bound by EU regulations on everything from the sale of cabbages to voting rights for prisoners. Meanwhile, the Better Together campaign is urging its followers to proselytise to family and friends. I don't particularly care what my family and friends think. I want to hear what the experts think. But so much is unknown and unknowable. Everything hinges on negotiation post-referendum. Far from the independence debate bringing people together, it has the potential to be highly divisive. The latest polls suggest a fall-off in support for independence, but whatever the outcome, between 30% and 50% of the population is likely to be disillusioned in the aftermath of the referendum. The fallout could last a generation. First minister's questions descends into a ding-dong about independence on a weekly basis while Scotland's economy bumps along the bottom. These debates have become increasingly surreal. Asked on Thursday by one of his backbenchers what advice he would give to David Cameron, Salmond exhorted the prime minister to ""let my people go"". The problem is that Salmond's vision of the Promised Land changes faster than the weather. Scotland would be like Iceland, Ireland, Qatar — the latest vision is of Bhutan, the low-tech, land-locked Himalayan kingdom, whose currency, the ngultrum, is tied to the Indian rupee and whose economy is based on tourism, forestry and agriculture. Economic growth there is dependent on the massive Tala Hydroelectricity project. Salmond wants to see green energy play a similar role in Scotland's economy. In terms of global economic league tables, however, Bhutan ranks 162nd in the world. Bhutan is no more a role model for a 21st-century Scotland than Narnia. The Promised Land, flowing with milk and honey, or whisky and oil, exists only in the minds of politicians, but the chances of us spending the next 40 years in the wilderness are all too real. gillian.bowditch@sunday-times.co.uk"
Left out in the cold?; Canada a laggard in global race for Arctic resources,Iceland,"The five hotels of the Northwest Territories town of Norman Wells (population: 800) saw more than their fair share of hard hats last year. ""You could not get a room there for six months last winter,"" said David Ramsay, Northwest Territories' minister of transportation industry, tourism and investment. ""Grocery stores saw a 100% increase in sales; it was unprecedented economic activity for that period of time - we are going to see even more this coming winter."" Norman Wells is not alone in witnessing this bonanza. Towns and communities across the vast Arctic landscape are waking up to the riches that lie buried beneath, as oil executives scope for prospects and Arctic governments take another 'strategic' look at the region's hydrocarbon and mineral riches. The area shared by Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States offers an estimated 46 trillion cubic metres of undiscovered global natural gas, or 30% of the global total. In addition, it holds 90 billion barrels of oil - or 13% of the estimated global total of undiscovered oil, according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey. While the Arctic's resource potential has been known for decades, the North Pole has historically presented a daunting logistical challenge. Until now. In what may be described as an environmentalist's worst nightmare, global warming and melting ice in the Arctic are rewarding oil companies with access to its thawing oil, gas and mineral deposits through greater shipping access. But that's just part of the equation. ""Climate change has reduced the barrier to entry - it is definitely an enabling factor,"" says Charles Emmerson, who wrote The Future History of the Arctic and is a senior research fellow at London-based Chatham House. He believes the entire Arctic area could see investments of more than $100-billion over the next decade, primarily in oil and gas, mining and shipping. ""Other key drivers include improved technology. Secondly, the cost of producing the fields may be less than before, and more importantly, the price for oil is right - not so much for gas."" Big Oil is also running out of places to drill. With stateowned enterprises shutting off oil majors in much of the Middle East and Latin America, the Arctic presents itself as a meltingly tempting prospect. But Canada may have to wait a little while longer, as oil majors focus on other opportunities. Moscow, Oslo and Washington already have Arctic projects underway and have drawn up far more advanced plans to exploit the region, potentially leaving Ottawa behind in the global (sled) race for Arctic resources. ""When I look at Canadian Arctic energy exploration, I see a litany of missed opportunities in the past,"" says Mr. Emmerson, who argues that mineral mining offers a better medium-term prospect in the Canadian North than hydrocarbons. ""But that's not necessarily such a bad thing. There are all kinds of environmental consequences of drilling for oil and gas. Canadian Arctic is one of the most remote parts of the Arctic. So if something were to go wrong, it would be incredibly hard to deal with."" Of course, Ottawa already has enough energy environmental concerns to deal with in the Alberta oil sands, and may not have the political appetite to take on environmentalists who are ramping up their global campaign against Arctic development. Which puts N.W.T. and Nunavut in a bind as the federal government controls sale of land and resources in the two Arctic territories. The premiers of the Yukon, N.W.T. and Nunavut met this month and pushed for greater say in the country energy's policy and on the intergovernmental Arctic Council - an association of coastal states and other interested parties that periodically discuss security, environment emergency response and development. Mr. Ramsay hopes the N.W.T. government will wrap up devolution negotations with Ottawa by 2014 and fasttrack its energy plans. By that time natural gas prices may have rebounded from their decade low, making N.W.T.'s centrepiece $16billion Mackenzie Gas Project feasible. The pipeline, which was stuck in Canada's regulatory quagmire for nine years, has now been shelved due to poor economic feasibility. The Mackenzie Gas project is not the only one up N.W.T.'s sleeves, with a total of 81 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 7 billion barrels of oil ""waiting to be taken,"" according to the minister. Husky Energy Inc. is building a 36-kilometre all-weather road between Norman Wells and Tulita, while Chevron Corp. is planning seismic exploration in the area this year. The government also recently sold two parcels north of Norman Wells, generating $92million in work commitment. Overall, the industry has committed close to $630-million of exploration over the next four to five years. But for now, the gas remains buried. With lower Canada and the United States awash in oil and shale gas, the idea of laying a gas pipeline through some of the underdeveloped Arctic plains may not be appealing, especially at $2 per British thermal unit of gas. Nunavut, which is estimated to hold a quarter of Canada's conventional oil reserves, is much further behind the N.W.T. in its devolution discussions with Ottawa. But negotiations have finally begun, said Peter Taptuna, Nunavut's minister of economic development and transportation, who has noted rising interest in lands along the southern reaches of the Sverdrup Basin, estimated to hold 500 million barrels of oil and 27 tcf of gas. ""In the next few years we may see renewed exploration occurring there,"" Mr. Taptuna said. Promising exploratory drilling in West Greenland waters has also led to considerable interest in the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. The federal government has begun research and the area could see a 'call for nominations' within a few years, Mr. Taptuna says. In the eastern Arctic, offshore of Baffin Island, estimates place the oil potential in the range of 10 billion to 30 billion barrels. Farther south, toward the Labrador Sea, there is an estimated two tcf to four tcf of gas reserves. Most of it may not see the light of the long Arctic days anytime soon.

China to build first polar-expedition icebreaker,Iceland,"China is set to construct its first icebreaker for polar expeditions, state media said Tuesday, in a move it described as greatly boosting its ability to explore the strategic Arctic. Melting ice sheets in the far north have opened up the possibility that ships could routinely cross through the Arctic Ocean as a shortcut between China and Europe as well as explore the oil-rich area. The ship ""is expected to greatly boost the country's expedition capacities in polar and oceanic regions"", the Xinhua state news agency said, citing the State Oceanic Administration. The vessel, which will be designed with the help a Finnish company and will be the first built in China, is set to begin operating in 2014. It will join the already active vessel, Xuelong, which was purchased from Ukraine in 1993. The 8,000-tonne ship will be able to break through 1.5 meters (five feet) of ice, Xinhua said, citing officials from the State Oceanic Administration. China has said it would like to play a larger role in the Arctic region. It has applied, alongside the European Union, Japan, South Korea and others, for permanent observer status on the Arctic Council. The eight-member council -- which includes Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States -- meets to discuss matters concerning the icy region. China's interest in the Arctic was highlighted last year when a Chinese property tycoon sought to purchase 300 square kilometres (200 square miles) of land in northern Iceland for a tourism project. The Icelandic government later blocked the deal after officials said China had considered using the island as a trans-Arctic shipping port. cdh/sai/jah"
The still point of the turning world,Iceland,"Paul Theroux A boathouse in Maine One afternoon in the middle of Albania, travelling for my book Pillars of Hercules (1995), I watched an old woman weeding and watering her handsome tomato plants, and I thought: that's what I want to be doing, but not here in Albania. There are many satisfactions in travel, but gardening is not one of them; nor is cooking for oneself typically part of the traveller's day, unless you're a camper. These are two activities I love: they are enjoyable and sustaining, and as old as the world. Another pleasure is sleeping soundly, getting up whenever I like. Travel involves early starts, hard beds, obscure squawks in the night, the presence of strangers, a great deal of negotiation, and often a measure of insecurity. I am not speaking about a tour of Italy or a spa holiday in Bangkok, but of something resembling my most recent trip, travelling overland by bus and car and truck from the southern tip of South Africa to the north of Angola. Angola is in large part an unknown land of bad roads, crowded cities, indifferent food, and - unusual for Africa - a country with no large wild animals. But it has diamonds and gold, and it is floating on a lake of oil. Most days on that long African trip, to relieve my harassed self, my mind's eye floated over a particular place in Maine, not far from the mid-coast town of Rockland, a structure I think of as the Boathouse. It is not my residential address, or what I call home, or where I keep my books and papers. Hidden among the spruce and birch of the shore, it is not roomy or grand. It is a getaway, a refuge, what a Russian would call a dacha - Chekhov writes about such houses all the time, and his story ""The New Dacha"" (sometimes translated as ""The New House""), with its interactions between deeply rooted locals and wash-ashores and summer-pukes, could easily take place in Maine. I have a garden. My wife and I have planted it all ourselves. She has a predilection for banks of wildflowers; mine is for shrubs and trees and grasses, including the greatest grass of all, non-invasive exotic clumping bamboo. We grow vegetables, too. We have a kitchen garden of herbs and peppers and tomatoes. A coastal patch of Maine, either blanketed in fog or bathed in marine sunlight, is the very antithesis of most of my travel destinations. But the dream of it has made me a better traveller. It is the definition of the familiar, of seclusion and silence, surrounded by the natural world. I go there to dig the garden, to make omelettes and fish stews, to row my boat, to put my feet up and read, to gaze at seals and sea birds, to remind myself that there is still order and beauty in the world, and a place for me. Such a refuge is a tonic to the spirit, what Darwin, in a similar context, called a resting place for the imagination.

Jan Morris The streets of Trieste The old seaport of Trieste is the city I have most frequented during a wandering life. It bewitches me, and my view of the place is entirely subjective. Trieste's long history has really been a vivid chronicle of ups-and-downs but, for me, it is essentially a timeless outpost of sweet melancholy, kind, wistful and alone, bypassed by geography on a fold in the map somewhere. That is how it really was, when I first arrived there at the end of the second world war, and that's how I see it still. I have to admit, nevertheless, that I found my subjectivity severely challenged when I arrived in Trieste one recent summer day to find it, beneath a blazing sun and a cloudless sky, in a condition of brash contemporary festivity. Where were the plangent suggestions of the old port, where was the sense of undefined longing that has brought me back, year after year, in search of some unattainable destination of the mind? Actually, nothing in particular was happening in the city that day. It was merely reality that was confronting me. The sounds that filled my nostalgic streets of calm were only the sounds of truth, the rush of traffic, the thump of drums, all the muddled rumpus of a big European city. The long promenade around the bay was only as jam-packed with sunbathers as any other civic seafront. Mini-skirts cheerfully abounded, tattoos were everywhere. The usual double-decker sightseeing bus rumbled by and, in the grand Piazza dell'Unità d'Italia on the central waterfront, precociously tireless infants chased each other around the municipal statuary. Gone was the decorous Triestine bourgeoisie of my fond fancy, and gone the Adriatic homeliness of the quays below the Piazza, redolent in my mind of steamers and red-sailed fishing-craft, for moored there were three vessels almost preternaturally emblematic of our times. There was a spanking white warship of the Egyptian navy. There was a gigantic private yacht, registered in George Town, Cayman Islands, all glitter and glitz and assumed by bystanders to belong to a Russian oligarch. And there was a black motor-yacht, retro-styled, ultra-chic and apparently made of plastic, whose nationality, ownership, purpose and meaning were, according to gossips on the jetty, equally shrouded in mystery. O, the times had changed! Everywhere I wandered, in every side alley and cul-de-sac, an al-fresco restaurant was bursting with custom beneath its sun-shades. When the sun went down, the night sky was alive with illuminated projectiles of some sort, often launched by those same indefatigable toddlers of the afternoon. And when I strolled into the forecourt beside the opera house, vaguely hoping for some strains of Verdi, I found it deafened by the applause of a hard rock concert. And yet, and yet ... my subjectivity was not delusion. There was nothing unpleasant to those crowds. Nothing but passing courtesies did I experience. The longer I wandered, the more comfortably was I reconciled to the reality of Trieste, 2012, and the more I discerned in it just the same qualities I had always cherished - the same strain of tristesse somewhere there, the same simple decencies, the same insistent hint of isolation. And when I found myself one of the quieter trattorias, and settled down to a fillet of turbot and a bottle of country white wine, gently encouraged by the staff of the establishment, I succumbed once more to the old spell of Trieste and knew it still to be true.

Tim Moore A farm in Iceland The first time I went to Svarfathardalur, 20 years ago, was during a grand tour of Iceland with my future parents-in-law. Theirs was a two-pronged mission to showcase their nation's raw natural majesty and induct an outlander into the clan, and this distant northern valley stabbed me with both. My father-in-law's ancestral homeland was a mighty, green scoop in the coastal mountains just shy of the Arctic Circle, thinly populated with ageless shepherds to whom I would shortly be related. One was still chasing his flock up the treeless slopes at 94, and later reigned as the oldest man in Iceland. Back in Reykjavík, home to my in-laws and more than half of all Icelanders, everyone spoke fluent English. Up here, I perfected my blushing nod. A few years later, the in-laws bought a small holiday-home farm in the valley, and we've gone there with our three children almost every summer since. The drive from Reykjavík is a dependable warm-up act, a five-hour epic through an otherworldly wilderness of lava, moss and treeless mountains. It is less like setting off on holiday than smuggling hobbits across some forsaken corner of Middle Earth. The final leg is on unmade gravel: no motoring thrill can match trailing a plume of dust across a mighty, open landscape, driving your mother-in-law's car. The true joy of yearly holiday encores is a micro-appreciation of what's changed, and what hasn't. My mother-in-law has been heroically nurturing several avenues of saplings around the farm's windswept perimeter, and takes me on a ritual tour to monitor their microscopic annual development. She's also steadily modernised the farmhouse but, even with wi-fi and treble glazing, it retains the soul of the horny-handed, muddy-booted shepherd's abode of our first visit. The doorways are low and the stairs askew. The basement kitchen still doubles up as the dining room, despite being so small it can barely single up as a kitchen. We once fed 22 cousins in there, local farmers wedged in with city slickers. Familiarity has bred content, and over the years we've settled into a timeless routine. Our daughters go off to ride winsome Icelandic ponies along the heathery hillsides, while our son disappears alone up some mountain for unsettling hours. Almost every day we go into Dalvík, the little fish-processing port at the head of the valley, to resupply at the state-run booze shop and the co-op that sells everything from wool to lemons, or to reel in cod from the Arctic waters off the dock, or to broil ourselves in the town's open-air geothermal pool. Dalvík is functional, whiffy and proud of it: a one-town rebuke to the banking bubble's nauseating greed and stupidity. It's Iceland as it was, egalitarian, quietly well-to-do and marinated in cod-liver oil. Every August they hold a Great Fish Day, in which free prawn-burgers and curried trout cakes are handed out to a crowd that, during our last trip, contained an eighth of the entire national population. Back at the farm, the long summer days end with a celebration of the most significant change since our visits began. Four years ago, geothermal water was piped up the valley, encouraging my in-laws to site a big hot tub on their rearward terrace. After dinner we all fill our glasses and cram in, gazing at the big, bare mountains through the rising steam, waiting for the sun to go down, knowing that at this time of year it won't.

Lucia van der Post A cottage in the Cévennes My husband and I spent several contentious years dreaming about buying a house in France. I could see it in my mind's eye. It would be an old-fashioned maison de maître or bastide, it would be roomy and airy and its old stone walls would glow golden in the sun. Around it would be fields of lavender, vines and olives. I'd cook traditional daube and pot-au-feu which, come the evening, would scent the air, mingling with the smells of pine and fig trees. We'd sit out under the peach trees downing something cold and chilled and all would be right with the world. The trouble was, we never gave it enough time and nothing we found was perfect. If the house was beautiful, and there were a few, it would be in a dull location, often surrounded by that particularly hideous suburban architecture the French go in for. If the location was perfect, then the house would have what seemed like insurmountable defects. So what happened is that our son and his wife gave up on us and bought something of their own. It's nothing like as grand as the house I'd envisaged, nor is it perfect, but it is wilder, more challenging, somehow more thrilling and it's done exactly what a holiday house should do - it has become an integral part of the family story, a place to spend time together, to refresh the ties that bind. It's where his three boys and many of their cousins first learnt to skim pebbles across a lake, dived from high trees into deep pools, honed their ferocious table tennis skills, ate their first bouillabaisse, saw their first wild boar and learnt to love walking through the gorges and across the plains of the Cévennes. For this is wild country, with none of the douceur or summer lassitude of Provence. It is poor, too, so there are no fancy restaurants, merely little family-run places that struggle to survive. It is a peasant farmhouse, built of stone, with intractable walls unconducive to ensuite bathrooms or central heating. It is halfway up a mountainside, and to get there you have to negotiate eight hairpin bends, but when you arrive the views are huge, a ruined fort strides across the horizon and the air is fresh and clean, scented with the smell of the garrigue which covers the plains. All around is forest. The whole family has come to love it. Right next door is a romantic ruin owned by some Parisian intellectuals for whom les événements of '68 were a coming of age in their golden youth. They come from time to time to discuss serious tomes - Le capitalisme, est-il moral? They have become dear friends. At night the owls hoot and the wild boars wage war on the garden, while by day the buzzards and the vultures (newly reintroduced) wheel up in the thermals. There is a rhythm to our time spent there. Saturdays and Sundays are market days in the nearest small town of Génolhac or the village of Chamborigaud. There, we buy home-made pâté, charcuterie and cheeses, pick up fragrant melons, fat tomatoes and great round artichokes. On the other days we walk up in the high hills of the Lozère, among the gorse and heather, heading for our favourite picnic spots. Or we go to one of the children's chosen swimming spots and lounge about and read. Occasionally, we make sorties to the nearby towns of Uses for its market and Barjac for its brocante fair or for household needs; or we might go to Nimes to see the Roman arena or take in an art fair. But above all, what makes it special is that it provides a place for the whole family of extended brothers, sisters and cousins, parents and grandparents to be together, to have adventures together in a beautiful and exhilarating part of the world. It isn't, as I say, perfect but we've discovered that perfection doesn't matter. The house has soul and that is what counts.

Pico Iyer A Californian monastery A travel writer's life is not easy, or lucrative. Which is a roundabout way of saying that, at the age of 55, when many of my friends are considering retirement, I don't have anything like a second home to holiday in. In fact, I don't even have a first: for the past 20 years my wife and I have been living in a two-room flat in the depths of rural Japan, which we rent for about £500 a month. Yet when I do want to get away from everything - not an easy thing for a travel writer, of course, for whom holidays are business - I've found the ideal getaway, to which I've been retreating several times a year for 21 straight years. It's cheap, it's less than four hours' drive from my mother's house and, wonderfully, it involves no visas, no inoculations, no forced sightseeing and very few preparations. Best of all, in this age when weekends have disappeared and bosses can get us wherever we happen to be, it offers the ultimate freedom, from mobile phones, laptops and TVs. As soon as I get there, something in me opens up and a single day seems to last 100 hours. My honorary second home is, of all unlikely things, a Catholic hermitage (though I'm not Catholic, and not entirely a hermit). It sits, better still, 400m above the great blue expanse of the Pacific Ocean, in that already otherworldly and radiant stretch of California coastline that surrounds the tiny settlement of Big Sur. It contains nine small but comfortable rooms with private gardens, overlooking the sea, that the 15 or so Benedictine monks in residence open to visitors, and there are also five self-sufficient trailers across the hillside that come with their own private kitchens and showers. Although I've been lucky enough to visit holiday homes from Jamaica to Corfu, and Bali to Cannes, I really can't imagine a more idyllic place in which to catch my breath and forget the world. I come home visibly refreshed. Meals are set out in a kitchen three times a day, and there is an elegant bookstore, and a beautiful chapel if you want it. A suggested donation for every night comes to less than even the smallest motel in the area that overlooks the ocean. The monks - former professional psychologists, coastguard workers, scholars and musicians - are unusually gregarious souls, always ready to talk about the latest John Cleese movie or what to do with your marriage. And, most unusually for any holiday, perhaps, the other people taking a break there couldn't be more quiet, open and congenial - in part because they've all come for silence, too. Such places exist on every continent, of course, and I've stayed happily in a convent on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, a Benedictine monastery in western Australia, a retreat-house in Kent in the UK and a Japanese temple on Koyasan. But all of us have our special loves, and the New Camaldoli Hermitage in Big Sur is the only place I know from which I always emerge alive, excited and ready to take on the world again, revived.

"British still giving hundreds of millions in aid to wealthy countries; Britain is still giving hundreds of millions of pounds in “development"" aid to wealthy countries, a Sunday Telegraph investigation has found.",Iceland,"Countries including China, Russia, Brazil, Iceland and Barbados are benefiting from funds intended to help the world’s poorest, despite a pledge for it to go only to the neediest. Among the schemes being paid for are a Turkish television channel, a scheme promoting tourism in Iceland’s national park, and a hotel training waiters in the tourist destination of Barbados. The situation was described by one MP as “farcical"" last night. The Government is now under pressure to reform aid spending - and to axe a commitment to increase it at a time when every other area of government bar the NHS is due to be cut. Meanwhile a new poll today by ICM for The Sunday Telegraph showed that 70 per cent of people questioned said o verseas aid should be scaled down, not increased. Two-thirds said a ring-fence, which protects it from spending cuts, was wrong. Separately, one charity last night warned that it was time to find an “exit strategy"" from the current system of spending aid money, in a sign that even recipients of the funds are losing confidence in how they are spent. The new disclosures come after the Sunday Telegraph last weekend revealed how the international aid industry had made millionaires out of so-called 'poverty barons’ - consultants running aid programmes abroad. At an event for consultants held last Thursday in Whitehall, the chairman of the meeting told participants: “There’s lots of money! We’ve all got money!"" Another delegate urged consultants to come to Barbados to benefit from the largesse of aid donors, saying “the beaches are lovely but so’s the business!"" while a third said: “I hope nobody from the Telegraph was here tonight."" Now this newspaper has uncovered how: * A sixth of the money spent by the Department for International Development (DfID) goes straight to the European Union’s aid programme; * The EU spends about half its aid budget of £10 billion on middle and higher income countries - even though Britain believes those countries are too wealthy to merit support; * Brussels has committed £30 million to 22 aid projects in China, a country with almost 150 billionaires, despite DfID closing its Chinese aid programme over a year ago; * Brazil, which will spend £9 billion on the Olympics in 2016, received more than £10 million in European aid for schemes including £660,000 spent on the social integration of women living in fishing communities and £120,000 on the 'integration of indigenous city dwellers’. DfID has set a target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid and UK money spent in Iceland, Turkey and other relatively wealthy nations such as the economic powerhouses of China and Russia count towards that goal. Dominic Raab, a leading Tory Eurosceptic, said: “It is farcical that the EU spends nearly a billion pounds of UK taxpayers’ money and a significant proportion of Britain’s aid on middle income countries. “Not only does that conflict with British aid priorities - which are increasingly focused on the world’s poorest - but EU development funds have been plagued by maladministration and fraud. This is a clear example of the folly of moves towards a single European foreign policy, and a prime candidate for repatriation to UK democratic control."" Pauline Latham, a Tory MP and member of the International Development select committee, said: “It is time to renegotiate the amount of money we give to Europe for aid. If the public really knew that our money was going to countries like Turkey, China, Russia, Iceland and Brazil they would be furious. “It is astonishing that European aid is going to middle income countries when there are so many countries that are so much poorer."" Iceland, Turkey and Croatia are among a number of countries given EU aid to help bring their institutions into line with EU member states ahead of possible accession. Other countries such as Ukraine, which received £120 million in 2011, are given vast sums simply as neighbourhood states. Russia, with more than 100 billionaires, was given £40 million, including £240,000 for an arts project in St Petersburg. The results of the project entitled: “Listening to Architecture, Composing Spaces"" will be presented at the St Petersburg Architectural Biennale in 2013 and at a conference at the hermitage Museum in 2014. Iceland receives about £4.2 million including £400,000 for a scheme to promote tourism in Katla national park; while Georgia is earmarked £80 million including £400,000 for a mayoral project in Tbilisi, which gives the capital responsibility for organising “Sustainable Energy days"". Outside of Europe, Argentina, one of the G20 major economies and whose relations with the UK remain strained over the Falklands, was earmarked £9.5 million in aid. Thailand gets funding for 22 projects, totalling £13 million, including £360,000 for the “Holistic Approach of Public Partnership for Environment"" - a project that promotes social cohesion in Chiang Mai. Kazakhstan, which is ruled by an autocrat and which has huge stocks of oil and gas, also receives EU aid including £100,000 spent on a human rights seminar in the former capital Almaty. Some of the the spending likely to raise even greater concern is on Turkey, whose economy enjoyed one of the fastest growth rates in 2011, but was the biggest recipient of EU aid with £620 million pledged in 2011. Projects including funding for a television series about the EU. Iceland, a country officially wealthier than the UK and which refuses to re-pay £2.3 billion owed to Britain in the credit crunch, receives funding for at least three projects including promoting tourism in a national park, and Croatia received £120 million in 2011 while the west African state of Mali, whose population is four times the size but 20 times poorer, was given £13.5 million from the EU. Details of the spending are contained in a draft EU report on international aid and on a EuropeAid internet database. Stephen Booth, research director at the think tank Open Europe, which has analysed European aid giving, said: “That UK taxpayers’ money can be handed over and spent in a way that the Government actively disagrees with, perfectly illustrates the lack of accountability inherent in the EU budget. In on-going EU budget talks, the Government must seek to re-establish the link between UK objectives and EU spending."" The European Union channels its aid money largely through EuropeAid and the European Development Fund. Money can either be given in the form of grants or contracts and paid direct to foreign governments or else to international aid organisations. DfID contributes about 15 per cent of the total EU aid budget but has no real say on how that money is then spent. DfID’s own 'root and branch’ review of its spending after the Coalition took power in 2010 concluded money was being wasted on countries such as China and Russia and that aid would instead be concentrated on the world’s poorest countries and conflict zones. The number of countries receiving DfID’s aid was slashed from 43 to 27. The EU’s anti-fraud office OLAF noted in a report in 2009 that its aid programme was vulnerable to fraud. The report concluded: “In the external aid area, OLAF investigators often encounter modus operandi typical of organised fraud."" A DFID spokesman said: “The new Secretary of State will be taking a close look at all DFID spending and has asked for an internal report into the use of independent technical experts. “We are determined to get the best value for the British taxpayer and as a result of pressure from the Coalition Government, the EU is reviewing its entire approach to aid: cutting funding to countries that don’t need it, refocusing its aid on results; and ensuring much greater transparency, value for money and accountability – just as the UK has done. We are pressing the EU to re-write its rules to focus aid on value for money and results as part of our current negotiations over the EU budget."" An EU spokesman said EuropeAid had a much wider 'field of responsibility’ than DfID but that the UK government “participates in setting EuropeAid’s priorities"". The spokesman said that from 2013 one of its aid funds will stop giving money to middle income countries. * The ICM poll of 2,029 people found that an overwhelming majority of voters (64 per cent) believe the Government is wrong to ring fence the international aid budget while other departments suffer cuts. The figure is nearly identical for Conservative voters (63 per cent), indicating support across the spectrum for reform, with only 14 per cent endorsing the policy. THe rest did not know. An even higher number (70 per cent) believes the planned rise in the foreign aid budget to the 0.7pc of GDP recommended by the UN should be scaled back, while just 16 per cent said the commitment should be met. The rest did not know. ICM Research interviewed a sample of 2,029 adults aged 18+ online on 20 and 21 September. The results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. * Additional reporting by Patrick Sawer and Edan Tal"
The World's Oddest Air Routes,Iceland,"For years, Armenian airline Armavia focused on ferrying Armenians across Europe and Asia. Now it is tapping a new market: Flying Sikhs between the U.K. and India. In July, Armavia started flying from Birmingham, England, where there is a large Sikh population, to Sikhism's spiritual center in Amritsar, India—via a stopover in Armenia. With just nine planes, Armavia must think creatively to compete, said Artur Zakaryan, the carrier's U.S. representative. And ""there is a market, so why not?"" Network planning in the airline business—determining which of a carrier's planes will fly where—is more than just fitting together a maze of well-traveled routes. Airlines must be shrewd observers of global economic and migration trends to spot profitable opportunities. The pressure has increased in recent years, as more saturated skies—nearly every high-traffic corridor is already served—have pushed airlines to look for niche routes with less pressure on profit margins. Over the past decade, airlines have added 10,000 new routes—a 37% increase—serving more than 37,000 city pairs this month, according to Innovata LLC, which analyzes airline schedule data. Often route planners are connecting cities that, at first glance, don't seem to fit. Take Baku, Azerbaijan, and Aberdeen, Scotland. Azerbaijan Airlines began flying between the two cities this summer because Baku has emerged as a major oil-producing hub and Aberdeen is Europe's petroleum capital. Or consider Paris and Cincinnati. While Delta Air Lines Inc. has slashed its international flights from Cincinnati over the past decade, it has spared the daily Paris flight partly because of the route's lucrative cargo: 4.2 million pounds of jet-engine parts ferried each year between factories near the two cities. Meanwhile, new diasporas are growing out of the widening web of trade links created by globalization—and in some cases by conflict and economic hardship. Boston has nonstop flights to Cape Verde, an island nation off the coast of Senegal, and to the Azores, nine volcanic islands in the middle of the Atlantic, because clusters of emigrants from both live in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Before the Cape Verde flight began as a year-round option in 2003, Cape Verdeans in the U.S. sometimes reached the island via Portugal, said Raquel Dias, who immigrated to Massachusetts 25 years ago from Cape Verde. ""It was complicated and expensive,"" she said. Now, she says she visits friends and family in Cape Verde nearly every year. For two decades after its launch in 1986, German budget carrier Germania Fluggesellschaft mbH focused on building a conventional route map that blanketed its home country and stretched to a few vacation hot spots, such as the Canary Islands. But in 2010, a tour operator in Iraqi Kurdistan alerted executives of Germania to the large Kurdish population in Germany and helped the airline enter the war-torn country. By the end of this year, Germania will be flying to Erbil and Sulaymaniyah in Iraq eight times a week—from twice weekly in 2010—from Munich, Düsseldorf and Stockholm. The Iraq flights are 90% full, Germania said, compared with the airline's average of 83%. ""Now we are looking out for other communities with Kurdish people in Europe,"" said Karsten Balke, a Germania attorney. ""Just doing the same job every day, every week doesn't help you because always you have competition... So we have to think ahead."" Brian Znotins, managing director of international planning for United Continental Holdings Inc., said the world's largest airline evaluates potential routes using a trove of public and purchased data on issues such as air traffic and immigration trends. It also talks to its corporate customers. Last November, United started flying nonstop flights five times a week from Houston to Lagos, Nigeria, in response to requests from oil companies that contract with the airline, Mr. Znotins said. Chris Wilmot, chief executive of Houston engineering and construction firm WCW International Inc., said he lobbied for the Lagos flight since 1999. ""I travel once a month to Lagos or Ghana"" to support his firm's work on telecommunications and other projects, he said. The nonstop ""saves at least 10 hours. Otherwise, you have to go through Europe."" In November, United and Delta begin flying to Williston, N.D., a town of about 24,000 that happens to be at the center of an oil boom. The city's airport, not built to accommodate so many passengers, is planning to use a mobile home to fit an extra waiting area. Cargo can also support mainstream flights. Delta flies 22 tons of asparagus on many of its flights from Lima, Peru, to Atlanta. Alaska Airlines, a unit of Alaska Air Group Inc., moves 3,000 pounds of basil from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to the U.S. daily. Or cargo can make even the smallest routes more attractive. The American Red Cross said its workers have taken flights in Tanzania that stop for honey, and if there was none on a given day, the passengers would have to spend the night and hope that the sweet cargo would appear. Airlines keep trying new combinations. In May, Icelandair Group is launching a twice-weekly, seven-hour flight to Anchorage, Alaska, ""opening up a new market for Icelandic tourism,"" the airline said. But not all the experiments work out. Air Greenland tried to stimulate tourist demand with a weekly flight between Baltimore and Kangerlussuaq in the summer of 2007, but only about 800 tickets were sold. The airline canceled the route months later. Jon Ostrower contributed to this article.

"STOP GIVING AID TO RICHER COUNTRIES, SAYS EX-UN CHIEF",Iceland,"FORMER United Nations chief Kofi Annan has backed calls for Britain and the EU to stop giving millions of pounds in aid to wealthy countries. He said booming nations such as China, Brazil and India should wean themselves off development funding so it could be targeted at 'weaker' parts of the world instead. His comments come after International Development Secretary Justine Greening called for the European Union to stop giving aid to relatively rich nations. She travelled to Luxembourg last week to say it is wrong that the EU's aid fund, to which the UK contributes more than £1billion a year, sends money to relatively rich countries such as Barbados, Iceland, China and Brazil. Britain refuses to fund such countries out of its own aid budget. However, the UK is still sending around £280million a year to India - even though the country can afford its own space programme and its president, Pranab Mukherjee, said in February: 'We do not require the aid. It is a peanut in our total development expenditure.' Conservative backbenchers want to see the Coalition drop its pledge to increase spending on foreign aid year-on-year, while cutting funding in every other department apart from the NHS. In 2014, taxpayers will be forking out £12.6billion a year on foreign aid - more than the £12.1billion it will be spending on the police. Mr Annan, a Ghanaian who was the UN secretary general from 1997 to 2006, said not all the countries who received aid from British taxpayers needed it. 'The emerging markets and the countries that are doing well should wean themselves off aid,' he said. 'Countries like Brazil, China, India, Ghana, Guatemala and Honduras; some of these countries can fend for themselves. In fact I have had the chance to suggest to some of them that they should not accept Britain's aid willingly. They need to say ""We are full enough"", so that there will be more money available for the really poor and weaker.' A sixth of the money spent by the Department for International Development goes to the EU's aid programme. Half of this £10billion budget is spent on middle and higher income countries, even though many say they are too wealthy to merit support. Brussels has committed £30million to numerous aid projects in China, which has almost 150 billionaires, and more than £10million to Brazil, which will spend £9billion on its 2016 Olympics and whose GDP overtook Britain's last year. But Mr Annan, who quit his job as Syrian peace envoy in August, also warned that governments rarely deliver all the aid they have promised. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival earlier this month, he added: 'The G8 and the G20 makes lots of noise, lots of publicity about aid which is not in the end delivered.' In recent weeks, it has emerged that British taxpayers' money has been splashed out on a string of projects in wealthy countries, while domestic cuts continue apace. Among the projects being paid for by the EU are a scheme promoting tourism in an Icelandic national park and a pro-EU television series in Turkey. And £1.8million has been handed to the Caribbean island of Barbados to build a hotel and leisure complex where 200 young people will be trained each year in 'hospitality management'. Some £800,000 out of the EU aid budget is going on a water park being built in Morocco by the French owners of Center Parcs. At the Tory conference earlier this month, Miss Greening said: 'I want to be clear that whether we give a pound directly, or through another organisation, I always expect value for money on behalf of the taxpayer. 'I want to bring that same focus on value for money in the UK to the EU in Brussels. I don't think it's right that the EU still gives money to those countries higher up the income scale, when we've taken the decision to target the poorest.' The Department for International Development has spent £500million on so-called 'poverty barons', private consultants running aid programmes abroad. Meanwhile, millions in aid was last month pledged to help expand an oil plant in India part-owned by the UK's richest man, billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal. © Daily Mail"
"Travel: Fresh from the freezer: Could Greenland, with its old reliance on whale and seal, become a gourmet destination? Its inventive new chefs think so, but will a frozen Tim Moore agree?: Way to go: The barren and permafrosted mid north-west must surely rank as the foodie's final frontier",Iceland,"Despite the best efforts of the Vikings, who chose its inviting name to hoodwink prospective settlers, no one expects Greenland to be lushly hospitable. Its bleak magnificence had been laid out beneath my plane window for half the morning: a frosted, monochrome enormity of granite and glaciers two-thirds the size of India, fringed with slightly more inhabitants than Hereford. All the same, stepping out into the still, bright morning at Kangerlussuaq airport, the brutal reality of life at minus 40C came as a shock. My nostrils crinkled as everything up them instantly froze. Then I breathed in, and Dracula punched me in the throat. I'd come to try a bold twin experiment by Greenland's tourist authorities. First, a new season for holidaymakers: the flesh-shattering depths of winter. February and March are the cruellest months in the Arctic and almost all visitors to Greenland currently come in summer, when you only need one pair of gloves. Second, a new destination for the adventurous gourmet. Copenhagen's Noma has become one of the world's most-feted restaurant (and ranked the very best for the last three years) with its freestyle riffs on Nordic cuisine. Denmark's former colony now finds itself in the gastronomic halo, a challenge for native chefs even in the south of the country, where the Vikings' bucolic brand name seems least outrageous - they've got trees and everything. I'd come to the barren and permafrosted mid north-west, which must surely rank as the foodie's final frontier. My base was Ilulissat, a town of 4,000 people and 2,500 sled dogs, situated, like every other settlement in Greenland, on the coast. It's a plucky, cheerful place with brightly coloured houses warming up the deep-frozen landscape, and a harbour strewn with little boats in ice-locked hibernation. Both the hotels I stayed in were spanking new and devoid of traditional local character - wisely so, as a turf roof and fish-oil heating isn't likely to bag too many stars on TripAdvisor. What they did have were some tirelessly dumbfounding vistas. Ilulissat means ""the icebergs"" in Greenlandic, and what a sight they were through the treble-glazing: sometimes a fleet of Tolkienesque dreadnoughts, sometimes a Henry Moore retrospective on the run, lined up on a massive iced horizon thickly buttered with sunset, or picked out by a full moon and the free-form green swooshes of the northern lights. Almost everyone in Ilulissat works in fishing, most of them at factories that process prawns and halibut for export to Denmark. Semi-independent Greenland is stumbling through a slow-motion divorce from its one-time overlord: Copenhagen still pays an annual subsidy and takes charge of foreign and financial policy but Inuit Greenlandic is now the sole official language, and the old Danish place names have been replaced. With its halting, sibilant clucks, Greenlandic is not an accessible tongue, though neither, as we've learnt from the strangled gurgles of many imported TV dramas, is Danish. The half-Greenlandic guide who showed me round what was once Jakubshavn said that her young son spoke better English than Danish. (She also told me that he once got frostbite on her 20-minute walk to school.) Reclaiming Greenland's national identity, insists champion chef Inunnguaq Hegelund, also means reclaiming its national cuisine. No easy task in a land where what passes for fertile soil is 500 years old. ""Well, it's amazing what you can do with angelica,"" he told me in his aunt's kitchen, bigging up one of the few plants that prospers here. Hegelund is an engagingly self-assured 24-year-old, who isn't entering the national catering finals this year ""to give someone else a chance"". His repertoire at Ilulissat's Hotel Arctic is inevitably fish-centric, but the splendid meal he created for us at his aunt's was a tribute to Greenland's unsung, land-based fauna. I didn't imagine that sheep could survive in Greenland. The one I ate bits of obviously hadn't, but it was beautifully succulent. I'd never even heard of muskox, which despite its name and the beefy rareness of its meat, is a massively furry goat. Hegelund set it off with a rich sauce made from crowberries, which ripen in tiny black hillside clusters during Greenland's nightless summers. I was told that Greenlandic culture remains rooted in the kill-everything-and-eat-it tradition of the macho outdoorsman but Hegelund understands that the typical gourmet tourist is unlikely to appreciate the marine-mammal aspect of this tradition. If the search for offshore oil continues to disappoint, tourism may prove crucial for Greenland's independence, and people who go there want to watch whales, not eat them. And it isn't just the ethics that might leave a bad taste for visitors: when I tried seal a few days later, it proved stubbornly unmoreish: dark, tough, fishy meat that tastes like the smell of 1970s cat food. The morals of seal hunting may deter some tourists from visiting but the clothing it yields is about practicality. My two-day dog-sledding trip simply would not have happened without my thermal sealskin anorak and salopettes, outermost of five layers of clothing. Without the matching mittens, and two pairs of under-gloves, I'd be typing this with my nose. I've been dog sledding before, in Lapland with two of my children a few years ago. Then I took charge of my own sled, or tried to, clinging on to the waist-high bar like a man being dragged down the Cresta Run on a Zimmer frame. This time, there were many more dogs: 16 huskies instead of four, a tangled dog's cradle of yapping jostles. Plus, I was a passenger, sitting with only the ropes that attached the luggage beneath me to hold on to. My driver, Hans, was old-school. Frost speckled his sparse beard, and his legs were sheathed in a voluminous pair of polar-bear-fur trousers. The following three hours offered an immersive experience of Greenland's hardcore winter wilderness. We swished across frigid lakes at the rear of an eight-sled canine convoy, the whiff of musky poo forcing its way up my nostrils through a bandit-scarf and two balaclavas. My face-holes began to leak fluids that soon solidified in the fabric that sheathed them. This grim carapace froze to my nose; then, after some ill-advised poking, to my tongue. My eyelids periodically bonded. When I got off to help push us up, everything instantly defrosted into steamy sweat. The process was promptly reversed when we barrelled down the snow-marbled granite on the other side. With the brilliant sun nosing into another golden goodbye our convoy reached a pair of cosy huts. Then sped right past them and out onto the frozen fjord behind. Hans and his friends were out here, in the ultra-remote, super-hostile middle of frozen nowhere, to go fishing. Some of them were already at it, winching up a long, many-hooked line through a hole in the ice. Hans told me it had been minus 55C out on the ice the week before. If the conditions were inhuman, then so was the alien panorama: a yawning white flatness girdled by heavy, lifeless mountains. As it was, the first of a succession of huge halibut emerged from the hole, each waist-high to the men who unhooked them. When the time came to cut them up into chunks they were frozen rigid. The huts, when we made it back to them, seemed as warm and welcoming as a village pub on Boxing Day, though by the time our fresh-off-the-sled halibut soup hit the boil, the water in my bottle still wasn't moving. I was too tired to care. The simple act of generating body heat all day had exhausted me: sitting on your arse is hard work when that arse is frozen. I rolled out a billion-tog sleeping bag on the floor and slept right through an apparently epic twin display of northern lights and snoring. We sledded back to Ilulissat and spent the following days in ever-smaller and more-remote settlements. I took a helicopter over the fractured ice sheet to Disko Island, a Danish name that probably hasn't survived just so that I could send funny text messages, but because the native variant is Qeqertarsuaq. Eight hundred people live in the only significant town, another huddle of warm houses and frozen boats. Backed by long, flat-topped mountains, it looked like rural Iceland with a broken boiler. Everyone kept telling me that Disko was a sea of green in the summer, ""though we know it's hard to believe"". Greenland's cultural collisions smashed out everywhere. Skinned seals were strung up from porches topped with satellite dishes. A hunter dragged a big, white arctic hare past a new supermarket full of Pringles and tortellini. Children in Manchester United shirts played three-and-in at a football net half-buried in iced snow. I had the finest meal of my trip - plump, moist, reindeer steak with crowberries - prepared by a Greenlandic cook who boasted that the only time he ever went outdoors was to smoke. The menu at Arthur, Disko's solitary restaurant, is winningly dependent on what this man can get his hands on: a fisherman had just turned up at the kitchen door with wolf-fish and a salesman's smile. When my helicopter out of Disko was delayed by a blizzard, the chef put together an impromptu muskox chilli. I was taken out to a headland on the edge of town by Outi and Mads Tervo, husband and wife researchers at Disko's venerable Arctic station. They're studying the song of the bowhead whale, a huge and mysterious animal that suffered more than most in the bad old days: during the 1850s, four bowheads were being slaughtered every day. Mads opened a hatch in a squat little lighthouse and handed me a headset connected to a distant array of submerged microphones. Whale song is a soaring, groaning electronic chorus. Its purpose is still hazy, but the Tervos have established that the anthem, mimicked identically by every bowhead, is different each year. Not bad going when you learn how many tunes some of them have to remember: recent autopsies have found evidence - in the form of ancient ivory harpoon tips embedded deep in their blubber - which suggests that bowheads can live for more than 200 years, longer than any other mammal. One which died during US president Bill Clinton's term of office survived a harpoon attack when Thomas Jefferson was president. It felt portentous when Outi pointed to sea, and in a distant patch of open water between the toothpaste-blue bergs, I saw two great black crescents rise and fall. The final trip out of Ilulissat was an hour-long jaunt for my snowmobile driver, and an ordeal of Scott-grade folly for me. Snowmobiles go much faster than dogs, so passengers get much colder. My goggles were impenetrably ice-rimed before we'd even left town. Blind, spent and mired in frozen mucus, by the time we arrived in Oqaatsut (formerly known as Rodebay) I didn't feel my life was worth saving. When I fumbled off my goggles my driver squinted at my central brow with some concern, then prodded it with an appraising thumb. ""Souvenir of Greenland,"" he grunted: a crusty red bindi of first-degree frostbite. I thawed out over a lavish marine buffet in a guesthouse run by a German couple. Wind-dried halibut, breaded capelin, deep-fried cod roe - as long as you forgot to eat the latter, everything was rewardingly weird and wonderful. I'd learned that even in Greenland's most unpromisingly desolate extremities - running water in Oqaatsut means a lump of melting iceberg in a tank - you will eat well. Perhaps especially well, with the nearest breakfast pop tart on the other side of two mountains and a frozen fjord. Afterwards, I went out to explore with Ole Dorph, town elder and de-facto mayor. Home to 46 people, Oqaatsut in deepest winter had the thrilling air of mankind's last stand. Big icebergs came right up to the door. Sled dogs howled beneath racks of wizened fish left out to dry. A fair few of the far-flung scatter of houses were abandoned, their frost-bleached furnishings picked out by the late sun coming in through cracked windows. Dorph told me that his town had been dying since its fish-processing plant closed in 2000. Oqaatsut had begun life in the 18th century as a Dutch whaling station. He pointed out the original barrel-making cooperage, still apparently in use. ""We have a little tourism,"" he said, ""but most of us must take our living from the sea."" When the fish plant closed, Dorph set up a local co-operative and after many years of lobbying was awarded the right to kill and process a bowhead whale. The necessary investment almost crippled the tiny town, and things got worse when the grim work was done. In the 40 years since Greenland landed its last bowhead, people had lost their taste for its very blubbery meat. The supermarkets wouldn't take it. Nor would local fishmarkets. As Dorph discovered, even the people of Oqaatsut didn't want to eat the stuff, and two years on are now feeding it to their dogs. I didn't know what to say, or what to think. This big fridge full of plastic bags was the final resting place of a mighty, majestic creature, the end of a life that might, just, have begun before Queen Victoria's. The people who lived here had, in the final analysis, slaughtered it for no reason, but I still felt for them. And with their nation's independence in some curious way beholden to ethically minded, foodie-centric extreme tourism, you have to believe that Oqaatsut's short-term loss is this truly astonishing country's long-term gain.

"Foreign aid: how the EU spending British money; Britain is giving hundreds of millions of pounds in aid to wealthy countries through the EU but much of the money is wasted, a report has found. Here we list some surprising beneficiaries of 'development' money.",Iceland,"Turkey Turkey, whose economy enjoyed one of the fastest growth rates in 2011, was the biggest recipient of EU aid with £620 million pledged in 2011. Among the projects paid for was a television series about the EU. Kazakhstan Kazakhstan is ruled by an autocrat and has huge supplies of both oil and gas. But that doesn't stop the country receiving EU aid, including £100,00 for a human rights ses seminar in the former capital Almaty. Iceland Iceland is officially richer than the UK but has been given money for at least three projects including £400,000 for promoting tourism in Katla national park. The country has never re-payed the £2.3 billion it owes to Britain following the credit crunch. It is thought to receive about £4.2 million. Thailand Around £13 million has been given to Thailand for 22 projects, including £360,000 for the “Holistic Approach of Public Partnership for Environment"" – a project that promotes social cohesion in Chiang Mai. Russia Russia has more than 100 billionaires but received £40 million, including £240,000 for an arts project in St Petersburg entitled “Listening to Architecture, Composing Spaces""."
The Nights and Lights of Reykjavik,Iceland,"CORRECTION APPENDEDTHE sky above Reykjavik was as dark as black ice, save for a handful of diamond stars. As a cutting wind whipped off the frigid sea and blew down the narrow streets lined with brightly painted storefronts, shivering pedestrians tightened their scarves and scurried into cozy bars and restaurants to find warmth. It was only 4:30 on a late November afternoon, but the Nordic night had already set in. And at this time of year it was set to stretch on for another 20 hours or so. My cellphone buzzed, and I reached for it with chilled fingers. ''Why on earth are you vacationing in Iceland?'' a friend texted. For people looking to escape the cold of winter, heading to an Arctic city where evening spans most of the clock and the temperature hovers around freezing may not seem an obvious choice. But this is Reykjavik, where Icelanders turn their backs on hibernation and luxuriate in an drawn-out night life that revs up as the sun goes down. Indeed, with every step I took in this cosmopolitan city of just over 120,000 people, a litany of surprising experiences would soon unfold, hidden behind closed doors in warm interiors, or laid bare under the frigid majesty of the volcanic landscape. A friend and I had come here to sample Iceland's natural wonders: thundering geysers, powerful waterfalls and the therapeutic waters of the Blue Lagoon, a vast thermal lake half an hour south of Reykjavik with a turquoise hue so impossibly bright that it looks Photoshopped. We wanted to spot the glowing green ribbons of the aurora borealis, which were reported to be especially luminescent this year because of sunspots casting a wide spectral aura over the North Pole. But it wasn't just Iceland's natural splendors that lured us: we also wanted to get a taste of the rollicking midnight club scene that Reykjavik has been known for since Bjork put it on the map. What we stumbled upon instead was another slice of nocturnal, urban Iceland: a diverse milieu of funky cafes, cutting-edge restaurants and Icelandic-chic bars, all catering to a cozy chat society that hummed late into the infinite night. I slipped the phone into my pocket -- an answer to my friend would have to wait -- and ducked into the Laundromat Cafe on Austurstraeti Street, one of several offbeat cafes where locals kick off the evening in front of a row of beers. Here, tourists find refuge after the brief window of daylight that allows them to explore the astounding panoramas of black lava and crystalline mountains outside Reykjavik. The polished wooden bar was lined with shelves containing hundreds of used novels and a clutch of red leather high-backed stools. Several suited banker-types had already quit the business district and were hovering over wine and smoked salmon, while 20-somethings in boots and expensive sweaters nursed juices and nibbled on cakes. Downstairs there was an actual Laundromat, where people talked over cappuccinos at a stout wooden table near a toddlers' playroom as their clothes spun dry. Icelanders, we quickly learned, are efficient and direct, especially in conversation. Ask if the northern lights have been brighter this year and you get a terse yes -- followed by silence. Waiters answer questions about the menu with monosyllabic precision, as was the case at Laundromat. But with a little banter people become warm and eager to chat about their country -- especially the nation's lingering economic crisis, a theme that poked its way into almost every discussion. Since 2009, when a financial crash was followed by a plunge in its currency, Iceland has been on sale for tourists. But the weak krona is still hobbling spending power for Icelanders, as one young waiter at Laundromat grumbled, adding that headlines suggesting that the nation has entered a miraculous recovery don't entirely ring true. Get an Icelander started on the ruggedness of the land, and more tales pour forth about how winter's constant darkness and the summer's midnight sun forge the national character. Eventually, someone will whisper that the island's snowcapped mountains are protected by trolls and elves, mystical creatures that, it turns out, many Icelanders still firmly believe exist today. One loquacious guide on a tour outside the city told us of a fairway on the outskirts of Reykjavik that was diverted around a pair of large boulders believed to be the homestead of a troll who did not want his habitat disturbed by modernity. Our hands duly de-iced, we bundled up again and left Laundromat to prowl the lengthening evening, pausing on the animated shopping streets of Bankastraeti, Laugavegur and Skolavordustigur in the heart of town. Clutches of red, green and white wooden storefronts edged the sidewalks, and young people dressed in designer parkas and fur hats lingered over eyebrow-arching price tags. Store windows were festooned with Arctic chic collections, taxidermied polar bears and the occasional flock of puffin dolls. There are no H&Ms; or Zara's here; instead, charming boutiques displayed streamlined Icelandic fashions made by local designers. At KronKron, on Laugavegur, Marie Antoinette shoes on steroids lined a window, with frilly leather and punctured suede atop multicolored stacked heels. They were expensive at up to 65,000 kronur ($514 at 126 kronur to the dollar) a pop, and hardly seemed functional, but they would look fabulous on the streets of New York or Paris. The wind was picking up, so we headed for an early dinner at Fish Market, an upscale Icelandic-Asian fusion restaurant on Adalstraeti near the waterfront. Bamboo flourished against a dark wall, and the tables were carved from hunks of Norwegian oak. Beside us, there were only two other couples. ''It's very cold outside,'' observed the waitress, scanning the empty room. And besides, she added, with the crisis, fewer Icelanders could afford fine dining. We studied the menu and pointed to the puffin and minke whale appetizers, Icelandic delicacies. The puffin (harvested locally, the waitress promised) was sliced thin, its gaminess muted with litchi and fig. The minke whale, also finely carved, tasted like beef tenderloin with a faint metallic finish; it was savory and delicate when paired with an airy wasabi cream. ANOTHER Icelandic haute cuisine option is Dill, farther afield on Sturlugotu. There, too, on an earlier weeknight, we practically had the chef to ourselves and dined on an exquisite meal that seemed to mirror the Icelandic landscape: an amuse-bouche of baby potato was lacquered in a sheen of black clay, lending it the aspect of a volcanic stone; brine-glazed bread jumped with a pungent spruce-needle-infused butter. A five-course tasting menu included goose confit with dill oil, and a creamy parsnip purée. The mignardises, the little sweets offered after the meal, looked plucked from the earth: licorice was molecularly rearranged into a lava rock form, and a passion fruit meringue had the texture of Icelandic moss. Our meal at Fish Market was no less remarkable. We finished with a pungent chocolate gateau with hand-creamed peanut sauce. When we left there around midnight, the sky was blacker, and the streets were empty. Life seemed to have petered out, but in fact, it was now bubbling inside a score of mod cafes. As we neared Reykjavik's oldest, a 1950s throwback called Prikid, on Bankastraeti, the sound of a booming bass thumped through the wooden door. Inside, a D.J. with dreadlocks spun LPs and white lights from a mirrored ball overhead skittered across the room. Patrons in stylish knit hoodies swayed to the rhythm of a saxophone. The bar turns into a soothing refuge for all-night partyers around 8 a.m., when a ''Hangover Killer'' breakfast is served -- a French fry-laden sandwich and vanilla milkshake dosed with Jack Daniels -- complete with a side of two Treo painkiller tablets. At about 12:30, up the street at Kaffe Koffin on Laugavegur, it was a different scene. A coterie of 20-something blond women drank coffee and nibbled on dessert cakes. Young men in scarves hovered over laptops on large couches strewn with patchwork pillows, basking in the warm glow of orange candles. A highchair signaled that toddlers were welcome. Farther on, the din of laughter was floating outside of Olstofa, a watering hole on Vegamotastig Street where writers, journalists, artists and other locals were cozied up in wooden booths drinking beer. People came in a steady stream, some climbing off bikes. ''It's like this every night,'' remarked the manager, Steinthor Matthiasson, a trim man in a jaunty wool cap and a thick brown sweater who pulled on a cigarette in the frosty air. Another 100 yards up Laugavegur, Boston was a dark room adorned with gold floral wallpaper and stylized paintings of cattle skulls. A young man strutted out the door wearing an oversize black-and-white Icelandic design jacket, Jay-Z style, and headed in the direction of Hverfisgata Street. There the uber-vogue bar at 101 Hotel caters to a well-heeled crowd under a glass ceiling with high walls. It was late, our heads were spinning, and we weren't ready to face the crowds at Faktory or Kaffibarinn, two of Reykjavik's more high-wattage clubs -- at least not on this night. In a few hours we would need to get up for a spectacular day tour of waterfalls, snowcapped mountains and lunar lava landscapes, although when we awoke, it would still be dark. I took off my gloves to text my friend, who had been pinging me for an answer from the warmth of a sunnier clime. ''Why Iceland?'' I texted back. ''Where do I begin?''

Environment: Frozen frontiers,Iceland,"For a body that has just undergone the biggest transformation in its 17-year history, the Arctic Council is hopelessly self-effacing. Tucked away at the end of a long, dim corridor inside a building full of polar researchers in Norway's northern city of Tromsø, it has just a handful of staff in a few temporary offices and an unpretentious meeting room. It hardly seems much for the club of eight countries with territory inside the Arctic Circle: the US, Russia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland and Denmark, which represents Greenland. Like so much else in the Arctic, however, this is about to change. At a little-noticed signing ceremony three weeks ago, the council finally set up a permanent secretariat in Tromsø with its first full-time director, a senior Icelandic civil servant. Soon, it will have more staff, a grander office and a bigger presence. It was, says Espen Barth Eide, Norway's foreign minister, ""a very important day in the history of the Arctic"". Yet this is only the latest sign of a surge in diplomatic, commercial and scientific activity in one of the world's last unspoilt wildernesses. Much of this Arctic awakening is being driven by the belief that rapidly melting Arctic ice will unleash access to more than a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas deposits, plus a lot of fish and tourist attractions. The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. < > So far, it has unfolded peacefully. But two distinct schools of thought are emerging about whether it will stay this way or eventually erupt into what Scott Borgerson, a US maritime policy specialist, has described as ""an armed mad dash"" for resource spoils in a region that never expected to need the rules to prevent such chaos. ""Either outcome is possible,"" says Canadian academic, Michael Byers, author of Who Owns the Arctic? Right now, he says, ""there is a concerted effort on the part of all the Arctic countries to steer future development towards co-operation and away from conflict"". But doubts persist. ""It sounds like Europe in 1935,"" says Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, the co-author of a study showing that some Arctic countries, including Russia, have already started rebuilding their Arctic military capabilities while others have plans to follow. Such is the uncertain backdrop to a region producing more surprises each year, not least in the shipping trade. The Arctic is home to two potentially game-changing shipping routes: the Northwest Passage through the Canadian archipelago and the Northern Sea Route above Russia. Each is thousands of kilometres shorter than current routes between Europe and Asia, and would be thousands of dollars cheaper to use - if they weren't full of ice for much of the year. But as the Arctic continues to warm faster than climate science models predict, this is changing fast, especially in the more developed Northern Sea Route over Russia. Last year 46 ships passed along this route, up from just four in 2010, according to data from the Centre for High North Logistics, a non-profit group backed by Norway's government that promotes Arctic shipping. Those 46 ships included polar research icebreaker the Snow Dragon, the first Chinese ship to make an Arctic crossing. ""It was striking how little ice there actually was during the voyage,"" says Egill Thor Nielsson, an Icelandic researcher aboard the vessel. Still, the Suez and Panama canals are unlikely to be worried just yet. They had more than 30,000 passages between them in 2012, said Paal Hilde of the Norwegian Institute of Defence Studies. ""The Northern Sea Route has to grow massively to become any kind of competitor with these other routes,"" he says. But the prospect of more shipping in a region where an oil spill could cause extreme environmental damage is of mounting concern, and not just to green activists. Cruise ship numbers in remote parts of the Arctic have grown over the past decade to the point at which, in peak season, there are as many as eight ships a week between Greenland and sparsely populated Spitsbergen Island, says Norway's vice-admiral Haakon Bruun-Hanssen. Some have upwards of 3,000 passengers, more than Spitsbergen's population, he told an Arctic conference in Tromsø last month. ""Due to the size of these ships, any accidents in these areas will have a catastrophic magnitude,"" he said. These maritime developments are among the most visible signs of change in the Arctic, and a big reason why bodies such as the Arctic Council are now unusually popular. When it was founded in 1996, the council agreed to admit organisations with an interest in the region as observers. A few European nations joined, including Germany and the UK, as well as the World Wildlife Fund and some less obvious groups, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Over the years, the observer waiting list grew longer (there are now 14 applications outstanding) and more Asian. China applied in 2006, South Korea in 2008 (along with the EU), Japan in 2009, Singapore in 2011 and India in 2012. Those who watch the council's workings closely trace the delays to a mix of diplomatic wrangles. Canada, for example, has been in dispute with the EU over Brussels' ban on seal products. Norway has until recently been wary of China, following Beijing's fury over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize going to jailed Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo. All of these, however, are an aside. The real measure of the council's importance has more to do with what its eight permanent member states are doing, not least its most powerful, the US. The last time the council had one of its two-yearly ministerial meetings, in 2011, Washington did two things it had never done before: it sent Hillary Clinton, its secretary of state, to the meeting rather than a more junior diplomat, and agreed to the setting up of a permanent secretariat. The same meeting signed off on another first: a binding treaty requiring the eight council members to co-ordinate the search-and-rescue efforts likely to be needed as a thawing Arctic makes shipping easier. May's ministerial meeting is expected to finalise a second treaty, this time on oil spill prevention, as well as the observer waiting list. For all that, the Arctic issue that provokes the most long-term anxiety is the region's oil and gas potential. The last public estimate of what lies beneath the region's seabed comes from a 2008 US Geological Survey study that showed the Arctic could have as much as 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil. As the Arctic melts, it is naturally assumed that companies will be more eager to extract this bounty. But so far, experts say the price of oil has been much more influential. The Arctic is undergoing its second period of offshore exploration, says Andrew Latham of the Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy. During the first, in the 1970s and 1980s, as many as 20 new wells a year were drilled. That number dipped during the 1990s in line with global oil prices, but it is now rising. Wood Mackenzie thinks the number of new wells drilled will only reach about 10 per year in the near term, despite the changing climate. ""Fundamentally, the oil price is what you are talking about,"" says Dr Latham, adding that the amount companies are spending in this expensive and inhospitable region is relatively small in proportion to their investments in other countries. Individually, however, the costs are large. Royal Dutch Shell has just spent $5bn struggling to drill wells off Alaska, and the UK's Cairn Energy has spent more than $1bn on fruitless drilling off Greenland. And these costs look even higher considering the USGS study appeared towards the beginning of a revolution in US shale gas and oil production. Since then, predictions of future global energy supplies have been overturned. Last year US gas prices were down to their lowest level in a decade. ""That means very, very expensive gas sitting offshore in the Arctic is now even more difficult to bring to market than it was before,"" says the USGS's Dr Donald L. Gautier, principal investigator for the 2008 assessment. Still, the potential worth of these resources in a world whose energy-hungry population is forecast to grow from 7bn to as much as 9bn by 2050 is clear. Clearer, some say, than the rules governing who will be able to extract them. First in line are the five states with an extensive Arctic coastline: Russia, the US, Canada, Norway and Denmark. Under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, each country has rights to an Exclusive Economic Zone stretching 200 nautical miles offshore that lets it extract fish or fossil fuels from in or under the sea. Beyond that 200 nautical mile limit, things become more tricky. Countries that have ratified the Law of the Sea convention can make a submission for more extensive seabed rights if they can prove their continental shelves extend that far. So far, Russia and Norway are alone among the five Arctic coastal states to have made such a submission and Norway's relatively modest claim has been approved. Russia, which made a much bigger grab for an area extending up to the North Pole, was told to come back with better data. It was an expedition to gather this evidence that led to the planting of a Russian flag on the North Pole seabed in 2007, a move that set off much of the anxiety about potential Arctic conflict. The US has not ratified the Law of the Sea convention, despite the best efforts of much of its foreign policy elite, who say this could undermine its ability to assert its rights in future. Canada and Denmark are due to make their submissions shortly. Once they do, the world will see if their claims overlap with those of Russia. ""This is where talk of the potential conflict in the Arctic comes about,"" says Martin Pratt, an international maritime boundaries expert at the UK's Durham university. Prof Pratt says such talk is overblown, arguing that experience of settling Arctic boundary disputes suggest that even if there are overlapping claims, they will be peacefully resolved. In addition, all five Arctic coastal states agreed in 2008 they would settle any territorial disputes under accepted principles of international law as they extended their claims to more Arctic territory. And all except Russia are Nato allies, so are considered unlikely to start firing on each other. Meanwhile, even with record Arctic thawing, oil and gas operations in the region remain difficult and expensive. ""In 50 years, if the ice cap is gone, it might change somewhat,"" says Prof Pratt. ""But it's still going to be cold, it's still going to be stormy and it's still going to be dark. It isn't the first place in the world you would look to exploit oil if you were given the choice."""
China Knocks on Iceland's Door,Iceland,"ICELAND'S long-isolated existence was broken by World War II and the Cold War when its strategic location at the gateway to the North Atlantic and the Arctic were key to the defense of NATO and the United States. But with the disintegration of the Soviet Union the island country seemed again to pass into irrelevance, and in 2006 the last American military aircraft were withdrawn from the Keflavik Air Base. Now the situation is changing again, as the melting north polar ice opens new ocean routes and access to vast natural resources. According to a 2008 estimate by the U.S. Geological Survey, 13 percent of all the unexploited oil, 30 percent of natural gas and 20 percent of the natural gas liquid resources are located under the seabed of the Arctic. Iceland is an ideal location to base ocean research, drilling and support for extraction and transport. The shrinking polar ice also introduces a revolutionary change in ocean transport between Asia and Europe -- the Northeast Polar Passage would reduce transport costs by as much as 40 percent as compared with the traditional route via the Suez Canal. Once again, Iceland has become a strategic gateway, and among the nations that are showing a growing interest in the country is China. The time has come for the United States to strengthen its relationship with Iceland. With the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, five member states of the Arctic Council -- the United States, Canada, Denmark-Greenland, Norway and Russia, joined by Iceland, Sweden and Finland -- declared their jurisdictional rights in the Arctic Region under the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Though Iceland is not regarded as a coastal state in the North Polar region, it lies in the Arctic and has recognized exploitation rights on the potentially mineral-rich coastal shelf of the Jan Mayen Island under a 1981 bilateral agreement with Norway. Although China has not stated an official policy on the Arctic, it is not likely to support the unilateral decisions of the Arctic Council. The polar sea route is of major importance to the world's leader in manufacturing. And China has made a major effort in recent years to acquire access to mineral and energy resources in many parts of the world. Chinese public institutes and scholars have maintained that Arctic maritime routes and seabed riches should be for the use of all mankind. China has also begun to court Iceland to help get access to the Arctic Council. Last year, Iceland was the first stop on an official European tour by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and a large Chinese delegation. And when the Chinese icebreaker Xuelong paid a call on Iceland, the crew was received by President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson at his residence. The colossus China and tiny Iceland, half a world apart, are now discussing a bilateral free-trade agreement. A Chinese proposal to build a ''tourist paradise'' at a vast, isolated site in northern Iceland could also be used as a facility for workers building and serving ports for trade and Arctic exploration. This undertaking in northeastern Iceland could also be integrated in China's recently announced interest in a multibillion-dollar project to develop iron mines north of Nuuk in Greenland. In short, China is reaching out for a position in the Arctic, beginning in Greenland, followed by support facilities in Iceland -- which is not a member of the European Union and seemingly has been put out in the cold by the United States -- with potential use for naval vessels patrolling the Arctic and the Northeast Polar Passage. Security and stability in the European Arctic region are a matter of vital interest to the European Union and the United States. Fortunately, bolstering that security does not require re-establishing a military base in Iceland or negotiating new treaties -- the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949, the U.S.-Iceland Defense Treaty of 1951 and arrangements agreed to in 2006 regarding air policing, military exercises and the establishment of joint search and rescue cooperation at Keflavik airport all remain in force. It is time for the United States to take the changing situation more fully into account. Firstly, that means first increasing consultations and cooperation with an old ally, friend and neighbor in the North Atlantic. At a minimum, the United States and Iceland should forge a closer relationship on Arctic issues. Supporting Iceland's efforts at economic security and stability would also bolster its continued importance for NATO in this increasingly important region. Secondly, Iceland should be included in the proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership while it concurrently moves toward membership in the European Union. Thirdly, the United States should visibly join Norway and Iceland in the coming ''Northern Viking'' military exercise. And the U.S. and Icelandic Coast Guards should develop more robust cooperation in providing search and rescue assistance from Keflavik Airport. It is through such clear actions of mutual help and cooperation that Iceland can continue to ensure its full freedom and independence. At the same time, the United States would make clear that full cooperation with Iceland, especially on access to raw materials and protection of the environment, are a key part of its national strategy in this increasingly important region.

Teeing Off at Edge of the Arctic? A Chinese Plan Baffles Iceland,Iceland,"GRIMSSTADIR, Iceland -- Struggling to stand upright against a howling wind, Bragi Benediktsson looked out over his family's land -- a barren expanse of snow and ice that a Chinese billionaire wants to turn into a golf course -- and laughed. ''Golf here is difficult,'' said Mr. Benediktsson, a 75-year-old sheep farmer. It was 11 a.m., and a pale sun had only just crawled sluggishly into the sky. The snow, which began falling in September, will probably continue until May. Even for Icelanders accustomed to harsh weather and isolation, Grimsstadir is a particularly desolate spot. But thanks to a poetry-loving Chinese tycoon with a thing for snow, it has become the setting for a bizarre Icelandic saga featuring geopolitical intrigue, tens of millions of dollars and a swarm of dark conspiracy theories. At the center of the drama is Huang Nubo, a former official in the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Department who, now a property developer in Beijing, wants to build a luxury hotel and an ''eco golf course'' for wealthy Chinese seeking clean air and solitude. ''It never seemed a very convincing business plan,'' said Iceland's interior minister, Ogmundur Jonasson, who last year rejected a request that Mr. Huang be exempted from Icelandic laws that restrict foreign ownership of land. ''I put many questions and got no answers,'' the minister added. Prodded by diplomats from the United States and other countries to take a hard look at Mr. Huang's intentions, Mr. Jonasson questioned what might lie behind China's curious interest in Grimsstadir. ''One has to look at this from a geopolitical perspective and ask about motivations,'' Mr. Jonasson said. Rebuffed in an initial attempt to buy a vast area of wilderness covering more than 100 square miles, Mr. Huang's Beijing-based company, the Zhongkun Group, is now pushing for a long-term lease arrangement instead -- and counting on the prospect that elections in Iceland next month will lead to a new, and perhaps more welcoming, government. The current government in Reykjavik, a left-of-center coalition, has mostly given Mr. Huang the cold shoulder. Even ministers who favor Chinese investment wonder what is really going on. Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphedinsson said that he saw no reason to block Mr. Huang's hotel venture, which is expected to cost more than $100 million, but that he was puzzled by Mr. Huang's desire to build a high-end resort in a place so isolated that ''you can almost hear ghosts dancing in the snow.'' As for playing golf, Mr. Skarphedinsson added, ''that doesn't seem very sensible.'' Such bafflement has stirred much speculation about what the Chinese tycoon and perhaps the Chinese authorities are up to. A proposal by the Zhongkun Group to renovate a small landing strip in the Grimsstadir area and buy 10 aircraft led to anxious talk of a Chinese air base. The area's relative proximity to deep fjords on Iceland's northeast coast near offshore oil reserves fueled speculation about a Chinese push for a naval facility and access to the Arctic's bountiful supplies of natural resources. Far-fetched rumors about Chinese missiles and listening posts led to worries about military personnel pouring in disguised as hoteliers and golf caddies. Mr. Huang could not be reached for comment: he was off climbing a mountain, his company said. In response to written questions, Xu Hong, a vice president at the company, dismissed speculation of a military purpose or other ulterior motives as ''the guesswork of post-cold-war thinking.'' Ms. Xu said Grimsstadir had been chosen because ''there is market demand in China'' for peace and quiet. ''Most Chinese now don't like to travel to dirty, noisy places,'' she said. Mr. Skarphedinsson scoffed at a widely held belief here that Mr. Huang is leading a plot by Beijing to secure a strategic foothold in Iceland, a NATO member that is entirely bereft of military muscle. Iceland also sits astride what will become important shipping lanes as ice-choked Arctic waters warm. China has openly declared its interest in shipping routes through the Arctic and in using Iceland as a future transport hub, Mr. Skarphedinsson said. But these goals, he added, have been hurt, not helped, by the cloud of suspicion generated by Mr. Huang. ''One thing the Chinese Communist Party never failed at since Mao is public relations, but the P.R. in this venture has failed miserably,'' Iceland's foreign minister said. Beijing's keen interest in Iceland, nearby Greenland and the wider Arctic region is well known. China is negotiating a Free Trade Area accord with Reykjavik, its first with a European nation, and last year it sent its prime minister at the time, Wen Jiabao, for a two-day visit. A Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, stopped off last year as part of a push by Beijing to gain entry as an observer to the Arctic Council, a body comprising the United States, Canada, Russia, Iceland and Nordic states in or near Arctic waters. China has also opened what, physically at least, is the biggest foreign embassy by far in Reykjavik, even though it has only seven accredited diplomats. ''Nobody knows what the devil they are up to,'' said Einar Benediktsson, Iceland's former ambassador to Washington and a critic of his country's expanding ties with Beijing. ''All we know is that it is very important to China to get a foothold in the Arctic, and Iceland is an easy prey.'' Mr. Huang's enthusiasm for Iceland at first stirred little concern. Nobody paid much attention when, in 2010, he suddenly popped up in Reykjavik to renew a long-dormant friendship with Hjorleifur Sveinbjornsson, a translator of Chinese literature he had roomed with at Peking University in the 1970s. Mr. Sveinbjornsson doubts his old roommate is part of an elaborate gambit by China. ''If we had not shared a room he would never have even heard of Iceland,'' he said. He is not sure that Grimsstadir will work as a resort: ''It is not the first place I would have chosen.'' But, noting that Mr. Huang ''is not an idiot,'' Mr. Sveinbjornsson said that ''maybe it takes somebody from the outside to see the potential.'' During his first trip to Iceland in 2010, Mr. Huang made no mention of any business plans but focused instead on poetry, announcing that he would put up $1 million to establish and finance the China-Iceland Cultural Fund. Led by his former roommate, the fund has since organized two meetings of poets, the first in Reykjavik in 2010, the second a year later in Beijing. A third planned in Norway for last year was scrapped after Mr. Huang's company declared Norway unacceptable as a site. Mr. Sveinbjornsson said no reason had been given, but he linked the move to Beijing's continuing fury at Norway over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in Oslo, which went to Liu Xiaobo, a jailed dissident Chinese writer. Less than a year after his first visit, Mr. Huang returned to Iceland and offered Mr. Benediktsson, the sheep farmer, $7 million for his land and that of some relatives and a second family. A business plan submitted later to the government by the Zhongkun Group said ''the location fitted perfectly with our strategic plans for developing environmentally friendly eco resorts in remote locations.'' The company said it would build a 100-room five-star resort hotel, luxury villas and the golf course. While exotic golf courses are all the rage now, this one seemed to many here a long shot. ''I've looked at this very closely and gone through all the documents, and I'm just aghast,'' said Edward Huijbens, director of the Icelandic Tourism Research Center in Akureyri, the main town in northern Iceland. ''The whole project is fundamentally not credible.'' But Mr. Huang's business strategy has apparently impressed the state-owned China Development Bank, which, according to the Zhongkun Group, last year reached a ''cooperation agreement'' with the company worth about $800 million. Ms. Xu, Zhongkun's vice president, said the Chinese bank ''will provide loans and financial support to concrete projects by Zhongkun, including, but not exclusively, in Iceland.'' There is now talk that some local mayors will buy the Grimsstadir land -- with money provided by Zhongkun -- and then lease a portion of it to Mr. Huang, but Mr. Jonasson, the interior minister who refused to give a green light to Mr. Huang's plans last year, is still suspicious. ''There are so many loose ends,'' the minister said. Changing a purchase into a lease does not change the fact that the hotel-golf complex ''makes very little sense,'' he added. Mr. Jonasson said Mr. Huang ''is not just a simple poet wanting to find peace of mind in the mountains of Iceland.'' Mr. Benediktsonn, the sheep farmer, has been swinging back and forth on whether he wants to sell his property. He does not like the idea that the area would be flooded with Chinese tourists and golf carts, but doubts that the resort will ever materialize, and, mindful of his own advanced age, calculates that if it does he will not be around. ''When the hotel goes up, I'll be down in the ground,'' he said."
Warm the gunboats: it's -58C in the world's next tinderbox,Iceland,"By and large, the world seems to have sorted out most of its boundary disputes. Yes, there's still a bit of argy-bargy in the south Atlantic and the Palestinians would argue that their allotment is a bit meagre. But even in the former Yugoslavia new nations can play football against one another without having to dig a mass grave afterwards. However, way up in the Arctic, in a place called Svalbard, I sense the mother of all boundary disputes is brewing. Svalbard is a collection of islands that appear to have been sprinkled like icing sugar on the top of the world. They were formed several hundred million years ago and then absolutely nothing happened until a Dutchman arrived in 1596. He decided there was nothing of any interest there, so he went away again. And nothing continued to happen until 1920. At this point the world decided it couldn't really have a land mass larger than Denmark that nobody actually owned. A treaty was therefore signed that meant Svalbard became a part of Norway. Today, though, cigarettes in Svalbard cost £1.40 a pack, which tells me one thing: this is most definitely not a part of Norway. And that's the problem. Svalbard is really far away. Several years ago I drove to the magnetic North Pole. It was a gruelling eight-day journey over a frozen ocean, through some of the most inhospitable weather you could possibly imagine. And I genuinely believed when I arrived that I was the most northern person in the world. Apart from Michael Parkinson. But Svalbard is even further north than that. So it's horrendously cold. Idiotically, savagely cold. When I was there last week the midday temperature was -58C. Incredibly, though, the Nors are trying to develop this place as a tourist destination. And they seem to be pulling it off. Mainly, I suspect, because this is the only place on earth that has polar bears and a scheduled air service back to civilisation. So you fly out there. You see a bear. You take out your camera to snap a picture. It isn't working because it's too cold. And then you die, in agony, of hypothermia. Alongside the bear-huggers, you also have the thrill-seekers. The sort of people who have surfed the biggest wave and climbed the highest mountain and who now want to hike around the world's northernmost inhabited settlement. Top tip: if this floats your boat, don't bother buying a return ticket, because after you leave the airport you will get about a quarter of a mile before you are eaten by a bear. And you will be grateful because inside its stomach you will at least be out of the wind. Me? Well, I was up there filming sequences for a new documentary about the Arctic convoys. This meant I spent five days sailing around the island of Spitsbergen trying to get an idea of what it was like for those poor souls in the merchant navy. I couldn't see much because the porthole in my cabin was frozen over on the inside but I did learn something. It turns out that you can get bored with crashing into icebergs. The first time it happens, you are scared and you rush about waving your arms in the air. The second time, you whimper and make your peace with God. But after the hundredth graunching impact you just turn over and go back to sleep. We made it all the way to South Cape before we hit ice so thick we couldn't go any further. At this point I climbed down a ladder and went for a walk on an iceberg. That was pretty cool. So pretty cool, in fact, that soon I climbed back up the ladder and made some soup. Back on dry land, I went to the town. It's called Longyearbyen and there are many restaurants where you can buy whale, and reindeer heart. There are bars, too, and shops that will sell you slippers made from bits of a seal. Beyond this small settlement, however, there is nothing but mile after mile of enormous scenery. It is utterly bewitching. I'd like to call it jaw-dropping but in temperatures such as this your jaw doesn't do much of anything at all. And after about half a second your eyes freeze over so they don't work, either. And then you die. As a tourist destination, then, it doesn't really work. Iceland is better. It may be diet-Arctic but it offers everything you can get in Svalbard, apart from the polar bears, and that's no great loss; disgusting, ugly, man-eating bastards, the lot of them. But if things are bad for the visitor, imagine what it's like to live and work in this remote place. Not many do. In fact, when my Airbus A320 landed, the population of Svalbard increased by 10%. Many are Thai. This is because one of the hotels employed a cleaner from Bangkok, who set up a laundrette. She employed two Thais to help her and pretty soon it was Australian rabbit syndrome. The government has provided them, and everyone else, with a school and a concert hall and it gives them tax breaks. It plainly wants people to live there. And so do the Russians. They continue to run a coalmine in the hinterland, even though, by all accounts, it produces only enough coal to keep the miners warm. Why? Ah, well, that's the tricky bit. You see, the treaty that gave Norway sovereignty over Svalbard also said that the 40 or so nations that signed it had the right to exploit whatever minerals and resources lay under the permafrost. And guess what they've recently found in the waters off Svalbard. Yup. Oil. So now you have Norway putting in the infrastructure and the Russians killing time. The Chinese are there as well, along with the Americans and the British. The Canadians are beefing up their navy. The Norwegians are claiming that the treaty applies only to Svalbard and not the waters that surround it. Denmark disagrees. So does Belgium. It's all very ugly. To sort it out, I'd normally suggest Britain send a gunboat. But the problem is that the Arctic is a terrible place to have a fight. The men who sailed on those Arctic convoys will testify to that."
Iceland premier to meet Chinese leaders in Beijing,Iceland,"Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir will meet with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang this month in Beijing as the countries sign a free trade agreement, her office said Saturday. ""The prime minister of Iceland, Johanna Sigurdardottir, and her wife, Jonina Leosdottir, will be on an official visit to China on April 15-18,"" it said in a statement. She will also meet with former premier Wen Jiabao and President Xi Jinping, on a visit that will include the signing of a trade deal between Reykjavik and Beijing after six years of negotiations. The agreement will be signed by the Icelandic foreign affairs minister and the Chinese commerce minister. ""The prime minister and premier Wen Jiabao agreed during his visit to Iceland in 2012 to put increased effort into finalising the agreement, so as to have it finalised within a year,"" Sigurdardottir's office said. Wen Jiabao's trip to Iceland in April last year was the first official visit by a Chinese premier to the North Atlantic island in 41 years, and saw the countries enter a deal on cooperation in the oil-rich Arctic region. China's interest in Iceland came to the fore in 2011 when a Chinese property tycoon tried to buy a large swathe of land in the north of the country for a tourism project. Some observers suggested that property magnate Huang Nubo's purchase would help China win a foothold in the Arctic amid general concern over Chinese investment in Europe. The deal was eventually blocked by the Icelandic government, after officials said China had mooted using the island as a trans-Arctic shipping port. Retreating ice has opened up the potential for a shorter cargo shipping route with Asia, which would cut the sea voyage between Shanghai and northern Europe by some 6,400 kilometres (4,000 miles). str-nsb/bm"
"Iceland first European country to sign free trade agreement with China; Iceland has become the first European country to sign a free trade agreement with China, offering hope to the small North Atlantic country for its recession-battered economy and giving Beijing a leg up in its drive for expanded influence in the Arctic.",Iceland,"The China-Iceland free trade pact will lower tariffs on a range of goods and is expected to boost seafood and other exports from the remote Nordic state to the world's second-largest economy. It comes at the start of a five-day visit to China by Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir that highlights her country's attempts to diversify an economy that was badly mauled by the bursting of a massive financial bubble in 2008. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told Sigurdardottir the agreement was ""a major event in China-Iceland relations"". ""It also signals the deepening of our relationship, especially our economic relationship which has been lifted to a new height,"" Li said during talks following a formal welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in the center of Beijing. Trade between China and the England-sized country of just over 315,000 people rose 21.1pc last year to $180m (£117m), according to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade. Iceland exports mostly fish to China and imports Chinese products from ships to shoes. Ms Sigurdardottir has been keen to push Icelandic services and the island's geothermal energy potential. Iceland has unique importance to China as it attempts to gain a foothold in the Arctic, where melting ice is opening passages for shipping and could create a boom in extraction of resources such as gas, oil, diamonds, gold and iron. China is seeking permanent observer status in the Arctic Council, an eight-nation body that includes Iceland and decides on policy in the region. China is expected to be accepted when a final decision is announced next month, drawing support from the prospect of heavy Chinese investment in the region's mining industries as advertised by its proposal to sink $2.3bn into Greenland to secure 15m tons of iron ore per year. Shipping via the Arctic, meanwhile, would cut about 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) and two weeks off the journey between northern Europe and Shanghai. Seeking to prove the route's viability, Chinese researchers last August completed their first 30,000-kilometer (19,000-mile) journey between Iceland and Shanghai. China sees a range of opportunities in the Arctic and will continue to expand its research in the area and conduct further expeditions, said Leiv Lunde, director of the Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute. ""It's attractive also for all the resources but China is already a major shipping nation ... and Chinese companies are now very eagerly awaiting policy signals from the Chinese government on what kind of priorities they will give to the Arctic,"" said Lunde, who was attending a conference Monday on Arctic issues in Shanghai. China's desire for a presence in the Arctic has prompted an unusual degree of interest in Iceland. China recently completed what is far-and-away the largest embassy complex in the Icelandic capital Reykjavik, reportedly capable of accommodating a staff of 500. Wen Jiabao, China's premier until a leadership transition was completed in March, included a rare stop in Iceland on a visit to Europe last year. It hasn't always been smooth sailing, however. Chinese investor Huang Nubo has been stymied in his bid to build an adventure tourism resort on a barren patch of northeastern Iceland that would include an airport, golf course and 120-room hotel. Iceland rejected his original bid to purchase the land that comprises 0.3pc of Iceland's territory, prompting an angry Huang to blame Western prejudice and unfounded suspicions that he was a tool of the Chinese military. Icelandic officials have said they don't see the resort as viable and Huang has said he would drop the project unless he gets approval by the end of May. Xu Hong, deputy general manager of Huang's Zhongkun Investment Group, said the company remained in contact with the landowner and Icelandic government. ""We're optimistic that we'll be able to have the response by the end of May,"" Xu said. Xu said no meetings were planned between Huang and Sigurdardottir during her visit."
DJ EU Faces Cold Shoulder in Iceland Vote,Iceland,"REYKJAVIK, Iceland--Four years ago, Iceland's electorate--seeking a harbor from financial turmoil--voted in a government that said entry to the European Union and euro zone would offer protection from currency volatility, punishing inflation and the embarrassment of a failed economy. As the tiny Nordic nation prepares to hit the polls Saturday, the EU dream is wilting. Strong tourism and fishing, widening trade relationships and the fact that the crisis that brought down three Icelandic banks is getting cleaned up has fueled skepticism about the idea. Recent events in Southern Europe have also dealt a blow to Iceland's EU proponents. Many prospective voters and top politicians point to the way Cyprus was handled as proof Icelanders would have little protection in the event of another crisis. ""The reasons for joining the euro didn't work out in Cyprus,"" Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, the head of the Progressive Party, said in an interview. ""What the economic crisis in Iceland and Europe has taught us is the importance of being able to control your own destiny."" Concerns ignited by Cyprus are accompanied by fears that the 27-member bloc's fishery rules would deflate the country's core industry. Fishing generates about 40% of exports and as a member of the European Economic Area but not the EU, leaders in the capital, Reykjavik, take cues on some trade rules from Brussels, but set their own fishing policies. Icelandic voters won't specifically decide on an EU referendum when they vote this weekend, but the two parties neck-and-neck atop the field (the Progressive and Independence) both favor putting EU negotiations initiated by the Social Democrats on ice. A government led by either party would likely slow or eventually ground Iceland's flight to the union. The results will give an indication of whether the euro still has drawing power for small and detached nations looking for heightened influence and better connections to export destinations. Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania are eager to join, but all of Iceland's Nordic peers, save Finland, say now isn't the time. Out on the fishing grounds, there is little support for joining the EU. ""It is a very bad feeling to lose control,"" Hjortur Gislason said while standing in the stern of his trawler, Freri, near a hatch where mackerel and herring poured in from nets drawn from the frigid North Atlantic. ""There would be someone else in the driver's seat."" Polls show Icelanders souring on the euro question over the four years Social Democrats have been in control. In 2009, current Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdadottir's vision of Iceland in the currency bloc was supported by 38% of the electorate and opposed by the same margin, according to Capacent Gallup, with the rest undecided. The most recent poll shows a massive swing: 58.5% against, 25% for, and only 16.5% unsure. But Katrin Juliusdottir, the finance minister and a Social Democrat, said that the euro issue is ""the hottest debate in politics"" but that it hasn't been adequately discussed in the 2013 election. In an interview, Ms. Juliusdottir said Iceland needs the economic boost that having a ""seat at the table"" holds for a nation of just 320,000 people. Leaders in the much larger Estonia, for instance, have cited joining the euro zone as a major factor in its economic rebound. It could be a stabilizing force in Iceland, where krona has been exceptionally volatile in times of crisis. Adopting the euro could help Iceland finally abandon capital controls put into place in 2009. Ms. Juliusdottir prefers a referendum on the EU issue, which could be as early as next year, she said. But Mr. Gunnlaugsson, a lead candidate to be Iceland's next prime minister, doubts deeper integration is needed. ""It seems Europe has entered a period of historic decline,"" he said, adding that Iceland must build ties with growing countries in Asia and elsewhere. Iceland recently became the first European country to sign a free-trade agreement with China, for instance. And licenses are being issued to foreign oil and gas companies in Europe and Asia interested in developing Iceland's untapped fields of natural resources. Mr. Gunnlaugsson built his popularity on the stance he took on Iceland's responsibility in the wake of the collapse of a bloated banking sector in 2008. As Iceland's economy recovered, legal challenges arose over who should cover deposits British and Dutch holders lost in a failed Icelandic bank. The Progressive Party always said Iceland should refuse and, after years of acrimony, the European court that rules on such cases agreed. Whereas Mr. Gunnlaugsson is still open to a referendum on the issue, the Independence Party, in control when the 2008 collapse took place and enjoying renewed popularity, wants to terminate the EU application before a referendum is even called.

DJ Arctic Council Considers China's Bid to Observe Meeting,Iceland,"The Arctic Council, a once-obscure regional forum that had little to show for itself, has nations queuing to participate at a meeting this week in Sweden, as melting ice makes shipping, tourism and resource extraction a reality in the nebulously delineated region. Among the 14 countries and organizations seeking so-called observer status at the meeting in Kiruna, northern Sweden, will be China, whose increased interest in the Arctic underscores the region's re-emergence as an area of potential geopolitical intrigue. The council's eight permanent members--the U.S., Canada, Russia and five Nordic nations--must agree to admit the new members. The Nordic nations, which have been courted aggressively by China, say they will. Canada has expressed reservations. It is unclear whether the U.S., which is sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the meeting, and Russia will agree, as they wake up to the increased economic, and perhaps military, potential of the vast stretches of Arctic territory within and north of their borders. ""Joining the council is more a political statement from countries like China,"" said Malte Humpert, an executive director at the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank, ""the idea of having a seat at the table in a region that is likely to become another realm of geopolitics."" Begun in 1996 as a body to coordinate Arctic policy, the council was for many years seen as a platform for scientists to swap research on environmental issues. More recently, it has gained prominence amid expectations that melting ice will clear the way for more resource development and free up trade routes. In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated some 22% of the world's undiscovered oil and natural-gas deposits are located above the Arctic Circle. On Wednesday, Canada will take over the council chairmanship in a meeting that will include signing a treaty on oil-spill preparedness and response as well as the decision on whether to increase the roster of permanent observers, with India, Japan, Italy and the European Union joining China and others on the list. Observer status, currently held by six countries, grants holders little more than the ability to attend meetings and propose projects, which then need to be approved by the permanent members. But Beijing and Chinese businesses have been aggressively courting the council's Nordic members in a bid, analysts say, to get a toehold in the Arctic. In April, China signed a free-trade deal with Iceland, its first with a European nation. In June 2012, then-Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Denmark, when Chinese companies signed a number of commercial deals. Chinese companies have also invested in Greenland, a self-governing part of Denmark. That appears to be paying off. ""Our opinion is that the countries which have a legitimate interest in discussing Arctic issues must be accepted as observers in the Arctic Council,"" Danish minister of foreign affairs, Villy Sovndal, said in an interview when asked about China's bid to join. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said that all of the Nordic countries agreed that all of the applicants should be allowed in. But Mr. Barth Eide said that, days ahead of the meeting, the Nordic countries are unclear on the views of Canada, the U.S. and Russia. ""We will do some intense work at the meeting in Kiruna to clarify this as fast as possible,"" he said. Canada has so far expressed caution about expanding the council, arguing that increased numbers could complicate its work, reduce focus on the Arctic's indigenous populations and take the meetings away from the actual Arctic. Leona Aglukkaq, minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, said the admission of extra observers is a ""serious issue."" ""My concern has always been the roles of the indigenous participants and. . .that their voices are not diminished,"" said Ms. Aglukkaq, who was raised in the Arctic. A U.S. official said a final decision had yet to be taken about granting China observer status. On Friday, the White House unveiled its National Strategy for the Arctic Region, promising to advance its security interests, protect the Arctic environment and strengthen international cooperation in a ""changing"" Arctic.

"Arctic Council admits China, six others as observers",Iceland,"The Arctic Council, at a meeting Wednesday in northern Sweden, granted permanent observer status to China and six others, in a powerful signal of the polar region's growing international importance. Foreign ministers of the eight-member council, including US Secretary of State John Kerry, made the decision at a biennial gathering, which took place in the town of Kiruna. The other countries given permanent observer status were India, Italy, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, adding to the geographic reach of the once-obscure group which promotes cooperation on environmental protection, oil and mineral exploitation, shipping, tourism and fishing. ""It strengthens the position of the Arctic Council on the international scene,"" said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, who chaired the meeting. The Arctic Council received an application for permanent EU observer status ""affirmatively"", but deferred a final decision on the issue. ""It will be implemented once certain questions have been tackled, but the decision means that the EU already now can act as an observer,"" Bildt's spokesman Erik Zsiga told AFP. The nature of the Council's reservations were not disclosed. But Canada, which took over the Arctic Council chairmanship on Wednesday, is known to be at loggerheads with the EU over a European ban on products derived from the seal hunt, which the EU says is conducted using inhumane methods. Permanent observers have no voting rights in the Council, but unlike ad hoc observers they are automatically invited to the group's meetings. ""It signals openness, and it reflects the fact that many countries outside the Arctic area also have legitimate interests in the development of the region,"" Danish Foreign Minister Villy Soevndal said in a statement. Rising temperatures have boosted international interest in the polar region, as melting ice causes transport routes to open up and makes hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. The Arctic is believed to hold some 90 billion barrels of oil and 30 percent of the world's yet-to-be discovered natural gas resources. ""When it comes to Singapore for example it is very clear that it is shipping issues they are interested in, the same thing is true for India,"" Bildt told Swedish Radio. China has opened an Arctic research centre in Norway's far north Svalbard region, and in mid-2012 the first Chinese ice breaker travelled from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the Arctic along the Russian coast, a 40 percent shorter route to Europe. ""China values the scientific research and environmental protection (work) of the Arctic Council,"" foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists in Beijing on Wednesday, before the council announced taking on China as a permanent observer. ""(It) has always supported the principles and purposes of the Arctic Council,"" he said. Bildt said yet more countries were lining up to apply for observer status, including Turkey and Mongolia. Global warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic as elsewhere on the planet, Bildt noted. ""The changing climate... creates new opportunities, not least for the Arctic states,"" he said. ""These, however, are also fraught with new challenges, and threats that must be confronted."" The Arctic Council is composed of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. A total of 13 countries now hold observer status, after Wednesday's decision. Meanwhile, Greenland boycotted Wednesday's meeting after Sweden refused to accept its representatives on an equal footing with other members, its prime minister said. ""Until Sweden took over the chairmanship in 2011, Denmark had three chairs at the table with a representative for each part of the Danish Commonwealth,"" Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond told Greenland daily Sermistiaq. Arctic Greenland, along with the Faeroe Islands, is part of the Danish Commonwealth. Under a home rule agreement with Denmark, Greenland has full control of its raw materials and internal affairs, while decisions on defence and international affairs reside with Denmark. ""When the Swedes took over, the commonwealth was only given one chair and Greenland and the Faeroe Islands had to sit behind and not directly in the negotiations,"" Hammond added, saying she feared that a new Canadian chairmanship would adopt the same principle. bur/po/ph/gk"
Canada pushes development as it takes over Arctic Council,Iceland,"Canada said Wednesday it will promote unprecedented industrial development in the far north as it takes over the helm of the Arctic Council, while activists called for a ban on oil drilling. Leona Aglukkaq, minister for northern affairs, told a teleconference from Sweden: ""With the help of our Arctic Council partners, we will focus on creating economic development and sustainable northern communities."" It is a priority embraced by all Arctic Council members, she said, adding that it must be done in an ""environmentally sustainable manner."" The intergovernmental forum -- composed of Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States -- aims to promote cooperation on environmental protection, oil and mineral exploitation, shipping, tourism and fishing. At a biennial gathering, which took place in the town of Kiruna, Sweden, Canada took over the rotating two-year chairmanship of the group, which is at a crossroads. Rising temperatures have boosted international interest in the polar region, as melting ice opens up shipping routes and makes hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. Global warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic than elsewhere on the planet, and many fear not only devastating impacts of warming but also from an influx of people and industry on the pristine environment, wildlife and Inuit culture. Aglukkaq's declaration came as Greenpeace protested outside Canada's parliament to press Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government to ban oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, which is believed to be rich in hydrocarbons. The activist group also called for an uninhabited area around the North Pole to be declared a sanctuary, to be protected from large-scale industrial development, such as oil drilling and industrial fishing. ""We will not stand by and let the Harper government use the next two years to advance its destructive industrial agenda at the Arctic Council,"" said Greenpeace's Christy Ferguson. ""The Arctic Council should be a forum for preventing environmental disasters like oil spills and fighting climate change -- not facilitating them."" Aglukkaq countered that northern residents ""want development."" The minister noted that mines or other industrial projects must be approved ""largely by aboriginal peoples"" as part of land claims agreements with the Canadian government. amc/rcw"
Cnooc teams up with Icelandic group in its play for Arctic oil,Iceland,"Cnooc has become the first Chinese oil company to make a play for oil in the Arctic after teaming up with an Icelandic business in a sign of the Asian country's growing interest in the polar region. The state-owned group is partnering with Eykon Energy, an inexperienced Icelandic company, to bid for an exploration licence off the northeast coast of Iceland amid a flurry of business activity between the two countries. ""There is an influx of international capital and companies to the Arctic looking for opportunities. It's not just oil and gas; there are minerals, there are potential new shipping routes,"" said Heidar Mar Gudjonsson, chairman of Eykon. Cnooc's interest in Icelandic oil exploration comes a month after China was successful in its bid to become a permanent observer at the Arctic Council, the main decision-making body in the region. It also followed Iceland becoming the first European country to sign a free-trade agreement with China in April. A number of business deals were signed at the same time including a confidential co-operation agreement between Arion Bank, one of Iceland's biggest lenders, and China Development Bank. It also comes as the most controversial deal mooted so far - a plan by a Chinese tycoon to rent a vast tract of remote land in northeast Iceland for a tourist resort - appears as if it could be revived following the change of government in Reykjavik last month. The new Icelandic minister of industry, Ragnheidur Elin Arnadottir, last year welcomed the proposed investment of Huang Nubo and is likely to be the one to decide on it if the Chinese real estate mogul resubmits his application. Halldor Johansson, Mr Huang's representative in Iceland, told local paper Frettabladid last week that he hoped to file the application in the summer after good discussions with regional authorities. Eykon turned to Cnooc after being told by Iceland's national energy authority that it needed to find an international partner for its bid for an exploration licence in the area around the island of Jan Mayen, which is shared between Reykjavik and Oslo. ""There is no political motive behind Eykon or this deal in particular. This is a very interesting exploration opportunity and there were a number of potential takers. Cnooc stepped up because it had more resources,"" Mr Gudjonsson said. The energy authority is aiming to decide by the autumn if the Cnooc-Eykon partnership should receive a licence. But Mr Gudjonsson played down expectations of an influx of Chinese companies into Iceland, at least as long as Reykjavik maintains capital controls that severely restrict currency in- and outflows. ""The issue in Iceland now are these capital controls. If you are investing offshore in oil drilling you won't be touched. But otherwise the controls are basically stifling the economy as there is no investment onshore,"" Mr Gudjonsson said. China has showed an increasing interest in the Arctic, which is home to a substantial amount of the world's undiscovered petroleum and mineral reserves and whose shipping routes could slash the time to transport goods from Asia to Europe. Last week it announced it would set up a new China-Nordic Arctic research centre in Shanghai, according to the China Daily newspaper."
"Dithering over Heathrow damages Scotland : The London airport debate is vital for our economic future, and it is essential that we should not be locked out of it, writes George Kerevan",Iceland,"YEARS ago Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a play whose basic premise is that hell is being locked up with other people. These days he would probably have a different premise: hell is spending time in any major airport. Yet here's the curious thing: airports are now the central fulcrum around which the global economy is hinged. More than a third of all the goods traded in the world (by value) go by air. The global manufacturing economy is based entirely on just-in-time supply of parts and components, which is only possible through air transport. Burgeoning internet retail commerce depends increasingly on postal delivery using overnight cargo planes. In short, economic growth = airport growth. In 2010, when an Icelandic volcano grounded transatlantic and European flights, much of the world's economy shut down. Farmers in Egypt, Kenya and Ghana could not get their crops to European supermarkets. BMW halted car production when components ran out. And I've not even mentioned the wholesale destructive impact on tourist travel. All this is important to remember when it comes to understanding the debate over the future of Heathrow airport. Last year, the coalition government reversed its manifesto pledge to veto Gordon Brown's plan for a third runway at Heathrow. Instead, it set up the Davies Commission to review how the UK might expand its airport capacity in the south-east. The Davies Commission failed to hold any public sessions in Scotland yet nobody at Holyrood raised a peep - a sign we have failed to grasp how important the airport debate is to us. The future of Scottish connectivity with the rest of the world is directly affected by what happens - or does not happen - at Heathrow. Our banking, oil and tourism industries, which account for a third of Scottish GDP, are heavily air-dependent, particularly on Heathrow. That will remain true whichever way we vote in the referendum. The vital point to grasp is that modern air routes operate on the hub and spoke principle. Outside of short regional interconnections, most flights go via a central hub airport before changing planes to reach their final destination. This is true of cargo as well as people. Using a hub to pool passengers, many fewer planes can reach many more cities than if you fly direct routes. The result is greater connectivity and cheaper flights. There's a downside: this model is dependent on the efficiency of the hub airport. Unfortunately, hub airports like Heathrow soon get swamped by growing traffic. Expanding them, or building new hubs, is exceedingly difficult, politically and economically. Local residents object fearsomely to noise pollution and inconvenience. Yet moving to a greenfield site is humongously expensive as it means replacing the entire transport infrastructure connecting to the airport. A new London airport could cost anything up to GBP65 billion, roughly half Scotland's GDP. This is one reason the government has postponed any decision on Heathrow till after the next general election, if then. There is a body of opinion that says we don't need to expand Heathrow or replace it - a joy to the ears of Tory politicians desperate to avoid taking difficult decisions in marginal West London seats. For self-styled environmentalists, strangling the growth of air travel by limiting runway capacity is an end in itself. Others argue there is ample capacity in London outside Heathrow, noting the capital is served by six different airports. You can also make a case that Heathrow is still ahead of its European rivals in providing flights to the world's key business destinations: 990 departures per week compared to 484 at Charles de Gaulle and 450 at Frankfurt (2011 data). So no hurry, then. These arguments ignore the fact that Heathrow is operating at 98 per cent capacity. A few centimetres of snow and the airport grinds to a halt. It is also without contest that Heathrow offers far fewer key Asian destinations than either Paris or Frankfurt, which between them have over 2,000 more flights per year to China. Above all, a dangerous trend is clear at Heathrow: the number of different destinations it serves has fallen by 20 per cent over the past two decades. Why not spread the load between Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Luton? This argument misses the point about airfreight, which is crucial to the economy. Genuine hub airports attract a vast investment in manufacturing, logistics and jobs. Heathrow shipped 1.5 million tonnes of freight last year, more than all the other UK airports combined. Compare this to a paltry 97,000 tonnes from Gatwick, which lacks the industrial or transport infrastructure for freight. So there is no ducking a solution to Heathrow congestion. Either Heathrow gets a third (and potentially a fourth) runway, which is the cheapest option as it plugs into the existing infrastructure. Or a new airport is built at the Isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary - Mayor Johnson has now shifted to this model, abandoning his original extravagant idea of constructing Boris Island. Doing nothing at Heathrow - which is odds on, given Westminster's craven politicians - will have severe implications for Scotland. Inevitably, Scottish connections to Heathrow will be squeezed to maintain precious slots for international routes. Some Scottish flights can be scattered to other London airports. But splitting the London hub into fragments undermines the economic rationale for the hub and spoke system. That will raise costs on Scottish routes and reduce the number of onward flights to Europe available from Scotland. Worst of all, to manage capacity, Air Passenger Duty will rise exponentially, hitting Scottish passengers in their wallets. The Heathrow issue is a classic case of London domestic politics taking precedence over UK and Scottish needs. Scotland and the English regions need to make their voices heard in this discussion."
Pentagon Releases Strategy For Arctic,Iceland,"WASHINGTON -- As a shrinking northern ice cap sets the stage for increased competition over natural resources, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday released the Pentagon's first ''Arctic Strategy,'' intended to safeguard American security interests and the region's environment. Speaking at an international security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Mr. Hagel described the challenges facing the world as rising global temperatures shrink the polar ice and as Russia, China and other nations compete for economic opportunities and influence in the region. He noted that tourism, shipping and commercial fishing might gravitate toward new Arctic sea routes, but he underscored in particular what could happen as nations vied for the region's vast quantities of oil and gas. ''A flood of interest in energy exploration has the potential to heighten tensions over other issues,'' Mr. Hagel said. Multilateral security cooperation will be a priority, he added, as ''this will ultimately help reduce the risk of conflict.'' Although the Arctic is a region of established nations, including the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden, the polar north will be shaped by economic, political and security issues arising from elsewhere around the world, Mr. Hagel said. ''Among them are the growing economic and geopolitical importance of the Asia-Pacific; conflict and instability across the Middle East and North Africa; the unprecedented diffusion of global economic power; new sources of and demand for energy; the rise of China, India, Brazil and other nations; environmental degradation and devastating natural disasters; and the role of technology in closely linking the world's people, their aspirations and their grievances,'' he said. While ''climate change does not directly cause conflict,'' Mr. Hagel said, it may ''significantly add to the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict.'' He cited ''food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and more severe natural disasters.'' The Pentagon's Arctic strategy places a priority on preparations to detect, deter, prevent and defeat threats to the United States even as the nation ''will continue to exercise U.S. sovereignty in and around Alaska,'' Mr. Hagel said. The strategy calls for working with ''private and public sector partners,'' including the State of Alaska and federal agencies such as the Coast Guard, he added, ''to improve our understanding and awareness of the Arctic environment so that we can operate safely and effectively.'' The Defense Department also seeks to preserve freedom of the seas throughout the Arctic region. A new focus on the Arctic will require the Pentagon to reshape its infrastructure and capabilities in the region. ''We are beginning to think about and plan for how our naval fleet and other capabilities and assets will need to adapt to the evolving shifts and requirements in the region,'' the defense secretary said. The United States has about 27,000 military personnel from active-duty units, the National Guard and reserves stationed in the Arctic, in Alaska. C-130 transport planes equipped with skis for landing and takeoff are deployed there, and nuclear submarines routinely patrol the polar region."
Nations jockey for Arctic position,Iceland,"WASHINGTON • The U.S. is racing to keep pace with stepped-up activity in the once-sleepy Arctic frontier, but it is far from being in the lead. Nations across the world are hurrying to stake claims to the Arctic’s resources, which might be home to 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its untapped natural gas. There are emerging fisheries and hidden minerals. Cruise liners loaded with tourists are sailing the Arctic’s frigid waters in increasing numbers. Cargo traffic along the Northern Sea Route, one of two shortcuts across the top of the Earth in summer, is on the rise. The U.S., which takes over the two-year rotating chairmanship of the eight-nation Arctic Council in 2015, has not ignored the Arctic, but critics say the U.S. is lagging behind the seven others: Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Denmark, through the semiautonomous territory of Greenland. “On par with the other Arctic nations, we are behind — behind in our thinking, behind in our vision,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. “We lack basic infrastructure, basic funding commitments to be prepared for the level of activity expected in the Arctic.” At a meeting before Thanksgiving with Secretary of State John Kerry, Murkowski suggested he name a U.S. ambassador or envoy to the Arctic — someone who could coordinate work on the Arctic being done by more than 20 federal agencies and take the lead on increasing U.S. activities in the region. Murkowski is trying to get Americans to stop thinking that the Arctic is just Alaska’s concern. The melting Arctic also is creating a new front of U.S. security concerns. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said expanding Russia’s military presence in the Arctic was a top priority for his nation’s armed forces."
"Diana Henry cooks delicious Icelandic dishes; On a trip to Reykjavík, Diana Henry loves how the humblest of ingredients take on head-cleansing sea and forest flavours. Think Nordic but even nicer…",Iceland,"You get predictable digs when you say you’re going to Reykjavík to check out the food. Your kids yell, “Yeah, mums go to Iceland!"" and fall about laughing, and from everyone else it’s, “Oh, whale and puffin then!"" The What to Eat sections of travel guides aren’t much better: “Icelanders love nothing better than putrified shark."" Yeah, and they all believe in trolls. Minke whale does appear on menus, but most Icelanders I met don’t eat it. (Tourists are exhorted to try the shark, though.) What you do find is sound home- cooking (in small cafés, as well as homes) – lamb stew, salt-cod gratin, reindeer with berries, pumpernickel ice cream – and, in a few high-end restaurants, cucumber-cool New Nordic cuisine. The shellfish and lamb (lambs there graze on seaweed, wild herbs and moss) are the best I’ve ever tasted. (In fact my partner insisted on closing his eyes when eating the lamb in order to savour it. I’m guessing it’s the seaweed.) The food is similar to that of Denmark and Sweden, but there are specifically Icelandic pleasures: rye bread cooked underground in geothermal heat, indigenous wild herbs, smoked lamb, and liquorice meringues. As in Britain, pizza and pasta are ubiquitous, both in homes and in restaurants, and indeed we have many of the ingredients they have. But the best of the younger chefs are headlining Icelandic produce. They use butter in preference to olive oil, apple vinegar instead of lemon. Seaweed is big (a particularly good dish is potatoes cooked in sea water then tossed with dulse butter). Skyr, a type of yogurt Icelanders love, is used to make herbed “skyronnaise"" to serve with fish and chips (the batter is made with barley and spelt flour). Mussels are cooked in Icelandic beer, and barley, which is now grown in eastern Iceland, crops up everywhere. The most popular flavourings – liquorice, caraway, dill and chervil – are head-cleansing, and I’m thinking of growing angelica after acquiring quite a taste for it there (picnicking on smoked lamb, rye flatbread and angelica jelly is a must). Most marked is that Nordic trait of putting the sea and the forest on to your plate (at Dill, Reykjavík’s best restaurant, they whip butter with oil pressed from spruce needles and serve it with bitter rye bread – it’s like eating trees). The top chefs are big on texture, too – rye crumbs, toasted millet, pinhead oatmeal – which isn’t surprising when you consider the Icelandic landscape. And real effort is made to extract flavour from even the humblest foods. Carrots cooked in carrot juice and swedes roasted until they were sweet and melting were a revelation. This mum’s keen to create a little bit of Iceland at home. Follow @StellaMagazine[https://twitter.com/StellaMagazine]"
"Northern lights; Constitutional innovation? Unnecessary sovereignty? A new Klondike? Columnist Doug Saunders convenes The Globe's own ‘Arctic circle' to consider the perceptions, risks, responsibilities and even the language of Canada's relationship with its land and peoples in the North. Some of their answers may surprise you",Iceland,"'FROZEN TREASURE CHEST' Doug Saunders: Just 100,000 Canadians – about 0.3 per cent of us – live in the three northern territories. What do southerners most misunderstand about the Canadian North? Mary Simon: I would like more Canadians to understand and value what it means to be an “Arctic nation.” Some years ago, when I was president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (Canada's national Inuit organization), I toured the country making presentations to Canadians on why the Arctic matters. The Canadian Arctic is the homeland of Inuit and other aboriginal peoples, and comprises a large part of the geography of our country. It is not, as a former minister of Indian Affairs mused, our “frozen treasure chest.” There is no other region in Canada that faces the breadth of complex environmental, social and political issues found today in the Arctic. Like all Canadians, Inuit are working hard to feed our families and live comfortably, and we want our children to succeed in school and find meaningful work. To achieve a lifestyle comparable to other Canadians, Inuit must be involved and truly benefit from resource development, and not at the cost of the environment that families still draw a livelihood around. Tony Penikett: The 20 or so northern land-claims settlements negotiated since 1973. Few Canadians realize the scale of these treaties. For 7,000 First Nations people in the Yukon, the treaties recognize title to 41,000 square kilometres (along with subsurface rights on two-thirds of that land), which is more land than is contained in all the Indian reserves in all of Southern Canada. And the Nunavut treaty made the Inuit there the largest private landowners in the world, with title to 350,000 square kilometres. The text of the Yukon treaty is longer than the New Testament. Canadians, it is said, do not want constitutional change, but in the territories, the changes have been enormous, all as the result of bottom-up innovation from aboriginal and territorial government leaders. Yukon aboriginal self-government agreements give First Nations quasi-provincial powers and were the model for settlements with the Nisga'a and others in B.C. and the Northwest Territories. But NWT First Nations have also experimented with regional shared governance arrangements with municipal authorities. As Simon Fraser professor Doug McArthur has written: “There is a new constitutional settlement in the North.” And nobody in the South knows much about it. Wade Davis: Canadians forget how recently European contact convulsed the lives of the Inuit … This, then, is the tragedy and perhaps the inspiration of the Arctic. A people that have endured so much – epidemic disease, the humiliation and violence of the residential schools, the culture of poverty inherent in the welfare system, drug and alcohol exposure leading to suicide rates six times that of Southern Canada – now, on the very eve of their emergence as a culture reborn, politically, socially, and psychologically – find themselves confronted by a force beyond their capacity to resist. The ice is melting, and with it, quite possibly a way of life. For most Canadians, climate change is seen as a technical and scientific challenge, distant from their lives. The Inuit live its reality every day. They are a people of the ice. As hunters, they depend on it for their survival, even as it inspires the very essence of their character and culture. Indeed, it is the very nature of ice, the way it moves, recedes, dissolves and reforms with the seasons, that gives such flexibility to the Inuit heart and spirit. They have no illusions of permanence. There is no time for regret. Despair is an insult to the imagination. Their grocery store is out there on the land. To live, they must kill the things they most love. Blood on ice in the Arctic is not a sign of death but an affirmation of life. Death is the disappearance of the ice. Climate change for the Inuit is not an environmental or political issue, but rather an issue of cultural survival, with profound psychological and indeed spiritual implications. 'SOBER THOUGHTS' Doug Saunders: In recent years, the North has taken on a new political and economic prominence in Canada. Will this create a new era of prosperity and independence for northern communities, or does it bring a risk of exploitation and damage to communities and environments? Michael Byers: Despite the increased media attention, Canada lags far behind other Arctic countries in seizing the opportunities presented by rising resource prices and retreating sea ice. Russia generates more than 20 per cent of its GDP from the Arctic. Norway profits from being the world leader in the high-tech field of Arctic oil and gas. Iceland has turned itself into a global tourist destination. As for Canada, consider this: Despite having the longest coastline of any of the Arctic countries, our most northern port is at Churchill – in Manitoba. Balancing economic development, local governance and environmental protection will never be easy. But serious investments in infrastructure – including a port at Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut – would be a good start. Shelagh Grant: As a historian, the excitement and hyperbole attached to the prospect of extensive mineral and fossil fuel development in the Canadian North reminds me of the promises associated with the building of the CPR and the Yukon Gold Rush. While the potential for new economic development is indeed exciting, second sober thoughts should consider the consequences for the predominately indigenous northern communities. For anyone who has visited an open-pit mine in the North, the ecological consequences are obvious. Although oil and gas developments are surprisingly less detrimental to the environment, the risks of a major oil spill could be catastrophic. Yet far too often, environmental issues gain more publicity than the more subtle social and economic questions. Most northern communities are led to believe that new mining developments will create new job opportunities and profits for local industries. But this has not happened with the Raglan Mine on the Ungava shores of Northern Quebec. Dare I suggest that what Canada needs is a leader who can convince all Canadians that it's in their best interest to make an extraordinary investment in the infrastructure and educational opportunities in the Far North to ensure that the future prosperity of our country. Otherwise, Northern Canada risks becoming an abandoned sand box after the large corporations have extracted all the treasures of any value. 'HUMAN FLAGPOLES' Doug Saunders: “Arctic sovereignty” has become a key catchphrase in media and politics, and many people believe that investments and military expansions are required to maintain or stake Canadian sovereignty. How important is this? John English: A few years ago, I was involved in a publishing project and was told that “Arctic sovereignty” had to be in the title, because it sells best. A casual scan of Canadian book titles quickly confirms the publisher's argument. It does “flare up” suddenly, as when the Manhattan and Polar Sea incidents apparently threatened Canada's Arctic claims, but the debates generate more confusion than clarity about the character of Canada's Arctic presence. Too often, “Arctic sovereignty” becomes the first refuge of political scoundrels who obscure the very real challenges facing Arctic communities, and the 1950s sovereignty flare-up in which Inuit families became “human flagpoles” is an appalling example of abuse. The Arctic Council contains two military superpowers, and Canada cannot hope to compete with them militarily. As long as others have a significant Arctic military presence, we must respond with better ships, planes and ports than we currently have. We also need to invest in our northern communities and assure that the Arctic Council, which was primarily a Canadian creation, remains the effective multilateral forum for Arctic states. Rob Huebert: Many will also contend that these are only diplomatic issues that are already well in hand. The logic that flows from such a view is that there really is not much needed to be spent on defence of Canadian Arctic sovereignty and that the resources would be better spent elsewhere. I would argue that this is not a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the issue. Defending Canadian Arctic sovereignty is not only about defining the borders and international legal status of the Canadian North – though it is often the first step that is necessary. It is really about the control of the region. Thus, I believe that, in order to protect the long-term interests of northerners and southerners, Canada does need the equipment, training, and personnel to ultimately defend and protect and enforce our interests, values and rules. Michael Byers: Canada's sovereignty is uncontested within 99.99 per cent of the territory we claim as our own, with the exception being tiny Hans Island – which Denmark also claims. Our two other Arctic disputes involve the maritime domain. Resolving these disputes is not a question of money or military power. A quarter of a century after the Cold War ended, we live in a deeply integrated, truly global economy. Denmark is part of the European Union, with which Canada recently negotiated a free-trade agreement. Canada is the United States's largest trading partner. And Russia, the newest member of the WTO, has an oil-and-gas-based economy that is heavily dependent on foreign capital, technology and markets. In the circumstances, there is no question of a “fight” over Arctic sovereignty, apart from a fight between lawyers. Although there are good reasons to spend money in the Arctic, sovereignty – legally defined – is not one of them. 'GETTING OFF CHEAP' Doug Saunders: What are the challenges and responsibilities for the future of northern peoples? What do we say to those who believe that Ottawa should not be subsidizing remote communities to the extent that we do? Tony Penikett: As I understand it, the complaint is that Canadians subsidize each Nunavummiut to the tune of something like $32,000 a year. That means each Canadian contributes about $30 a year to support Nunavut. But, as is often said, since the Cold War-era relocations to Ellesmere Island, the Inuit of Nunavut have been the human flagpoles of Canadian sovereignty and Arctic security. The United States bases 25,000 armed-forces personnel in Alaska at a likely cost of about $100 or more a year per American. Nunavummiut suffer the highest food, housing and energy prices in Canada – in other words, extreme food insecurity and seriously overcrowded homes. And since Canada's military presence in the Arctic remains light on the ground, maybe Canada is getting off cheap and our flagpoles deserve more support. Mary Simon: Can we not at least agree that Canadians, along with other northern nations, understand that distance, small populations and cultural diversity are part of our national character and part of what makes us a polar nation? I also want to say that the “remoteness” of Arctic communities is outdated thinking in an age of daily air travel and Internet connectivity. As the late Jose Kusugak once said, Inuit view themselves as “First Canadians, Canadians First,” and we want to be full contributors to Canada. Thoughtful development of Arctic resources will attract investment in Canada, create employment for Canadians, pay royalties to governments and Inuit, and buy goods and services from the provinces. We are trying to accomplish in the North in two generations what Canada has done in other regions in six generations. To the critics, we say this: Canada is a polar nation. Realizing the possibilities of the Arctic region and its people will take more time and necessitates the long view that a country with 150 years of nation-building experience should understand. ******** PANELISTS Mary Simon has served as Canada's first ambassador for circumpolar affairs, as president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and as lead negotiator for the creation of the Arctic Council.

"NORDIC CULTURE: The blond leading the blond: This enjoyable survey of all things Nordic finds that our friends in the north are as flawed as we are, writes Oslo-born Mariella Frostrup: The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle Michael Booth Jonathan Cape pounds 14.99, pp416",Iceland,"It's a source of some surprise that despite our proximity to the richest, the most socially advanced and the happiest societies on earth (Norway, Sweden and Denmark respectively), the UK population hasn't chosen to emigrate en masse. Instead, our gaze remains resolutely focused southwards, as constant as this year's rain, whether for sun or snow, diet or quality of life, while our northerly neighbours merit barely a glance. Between them they boast the Nobel prize and Ikea, H&M; and enough crude oil to rival Saudi Arabia, the best education system, the best health service and unrivalled gender equality, but they seldom make headlines. On his odyssey among the ""Almost Nearly Perfect People"", British journalist Michael Booth has managed to uncover a few facts of truly tabloid vintage: neutral Sweden is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world, 5% of Danish men have had sex with animals, and 54% of Icelanders believe in elves. None of the latter is likely to increase tourism to the far north, but as the author points out, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark do little to promote themselves. One theory about my fellow Scandinavians' reticence to holler about their virtues is that there'd be a stampede if they advertised. It's the only plausible explanation not covered in Michael Booth's comprehensive and occasionally downright hilarious explanation of the Nordic miracle, as imagined by everyone living outside of this social democratic hotspot. Spurred by yet another survey describing his wife's fellow Danes as the happiest people on earth, Booth, a Copenhagen resident, elected to investigate what really makes the Scandinavians tick. Dedicating a section to each of the five countries he maintains make up the Nordic bloc, he takes us as deep into the Scandinavian psyche as we're ever likely to want to go; from the Danish addiction to the sterile comforts of hyggelig, or ""cosy times"", to Norwegian isolationism, the Finns' much vaunted sisu, or machismo, the Swedes' obsessive conformity and the Icelandic devil-may-care approach to banking. Of my birthplace Booth comments, ""When a man is bored of Oslo. . . he's probably been there three days"", going on to reveal that the Norwegians' biggest hit TV show of recent years isn't from the Nordic noir stable but a seven-hour documentary of a train's real-life progress from Bergen to Oslo with a camera strapped to the front of it! Booth's wry eye zooms in on many such characteristics and peccadillos of our closest cousins. By the time he gets to Sweden, commonly regarded as the most perfect nation on earth, and chooses to provoke the uber-conformist population (his conclusion not mine) by committing acts of social terrorism like eating crisps and slurping coke in the Swedish National museum or abandoning all common sense and crossing streets while the lights are still red, I was laughing out loud. His companionable, lightly mocking tone remains in place when he veers to the darker extremities, exploring, among much else, the Finnish addiction to anti-psychotic drugs, the Norwegian antisocial tendencies and weird penchant for 19th-century national costume, the Icelandic revenge against the Danes via a suicidal corporate spending spree, and Sweden's questionable freedom of speech credentials when it comes to the far right. This amble through Scandiland may be light on any profound conclusion, but it's a lively and endearing portrait of our friends in the north, venerated globally for their perfectly balanced societies but, it turns out, as flawed as the rest of us - or at least only almost perfect.

US to appoint Arctic envoy,Iceland,"The United States announced Friday it would appoint a special envoy to the Arctic, a region increasingly coveted by several countries for its oil and other raw materials. Secretary of State John Kerry pointed to the huge resources that lie in the northernmost polar region as he unveiled plans to name a senior ""official of stature"" to advance American interests as Washington prepares to chair the eight-country Arctic Council next year. ""The Arctic region is the last global frontier and a region with enormous and growing geostrategic, economic, climate, environment and national security implications for the United States and the world,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""The great challenges of the Arctic matter enormously to the United States, and they hit especially close to home for Alaska."" Six of the eight Arctic nations -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States -- currently have ambassador-level diplomats representing them before the Arctic council. Parts of Alaska and other US territories lie in the Arctic. ""President (Barack) Obama and I are committed to elevating our attention and effort to keep up with the opportunities and consequences presented by the Arctic's rapid transformation - a very rare convergence of almost every national priority in the most rapidly - changing region on the face of the Earth,"" Kerry said. ""Going forward, I look forward to continuing to work closely with Alaska's Congressional delegation to strengthen America's engagement in Arctic issues."" Alaska Senator Mark Begich, who has pushed legislation for a US envoy to the region since 2008, called Kerry's decision an ""important step in the right direction."" ""The bottom line is that the changes we see in the Arctic warrant a higher level of involvement from the US and this position will allow us to better exercise leadership and vision in Arctic policy moving forward,"" the Democratic lawmaker added. The Arctic has seen growing international interest in recent years, as global warming causes the Arctic ice cap to melt and opens new navigation routes that facilitate the use of previously inaccessible raw materials. Canada currently holds the rotating, two-year presidency of the Arctic Council, which promotes cooperation on issues such as environmental protection, oil and gas mining, shipping, fishing and tourism. In early January, Canada began construction on the first route linking the Arctic Ocean to the North American continent, which should speed up oil and gas exploration in the desert region. The white desert is believed to hold about 22 percent of the world's unexplored conventional hydrocarbon resources. nr/oh/rcw"

"As the World Warms, Navy Strategists Plan for an Arctic Rush",Iceland,"Approximately 25,000 polar bears live in and around the Arctic Circle. Climate change has put the majestic ursines, a longtime favorite of children’s books and Christmas cards, in peril. In 2008, the United States listed them as a “threatened species” under the Endangered Species Act, and populations have been on the decline since then. So when is it acceptable for a Marine to shoot one? The Navy is still trying to figure that out. Walter Berbrick, a retired Navy officer and a professor of war games at the U.S. Naval War College, was conducting the Fleet Arctic Operations Game in 2011, simulating, among other things, how the Navy would respond to an oil spill in the Arctic, when he discovered there were no rules of engagement for polar bears. “You’ve really got to be mindful of where you’re at and where they’re at,” Berbrick says, pointing out that polar bears travel in open waters and on ice floes where naval units would have to operate. “Folks need to be trained and deployed understanding their interaction with polar bears. The Navy needs some kind of specialized force protection training, policies, rules of engagement. “It’s something the Navy doesn’t think about or plan for or prepare for, because there hasn’t been a demand for it,” he says. Until now. In February, the Navy released the U.S. Navy Arctic Roadmap for 2014 to 2030, a document outlining naval preparations for the region. It doesn’t address rules of engagement for polar bears, but it does lay out various other necessities for Naval capabilities in the Arctic, from new satellite communications equipment to cold-weather training exercises. The Navy’s road map followed the Department of Defense’s “Arctic Strategy” report of November 2013 and the White House’s May 2013 “National Security Strategy for the Arctic Region.” The documents make up a nascent Arctic strategy. As global warming melts Arctic ice, the region is being opened to increased commercial activity like shipping, mining and drilling. And along with human activity comes foreign policy and military strategy. Strategists in the Navy and throughout the government are scrambling to put policies in place, develop technology and create a plan of action for this burgeoning region of commercial activity. A Very Chilly Canary The Arctic covers some 5.5 million square miles: 8 percent of the earth’s surface and 15 percent of its total landmass. Eight countries—Russia, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland and the United States—have territory that extends into the Arctic Circle. About 13 million people live within the Arctic Circle, around 7 million fewer than in the New York City metropolitan area. That’s because the Arctic has some of harshest climates on the planet: Temperatures dip to -50 F in the winter. Human-made climate change affects the whole world, but the Arctic is feeling its impact more quickly and dramatically than elsewhere. The Arctic is “global warming’s canary in the coal mine,” in the words of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Since 1978, the winter Arctic ice cap—the complete ice coverage that lasts through the winter and recedes in the summer—has shrunk by 12 percent every decade. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted melting Arctic ice as one of the first serious casualties of global warming. And these changes are happening faster than anyone predicted. “Climate models have consistently underestimated the rate of change in the Arctic,” Jan-Gunnar Winther, the director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, said in a recent interview with an environmental news website. “We must be aware that the future could bring yet more surprises in the region.” In the past year, Arctic sea ice was at the fifth-lowest level since recording began. The lowest level came in 2011. Disappearing sea ice is bad news for the planet, but not everyone is mourning. “It’s great if you’re a shipper,” says Laurence Smith, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the region. Cargo transit through the Russian Arctic Northern Sea Route hit an all-time high in 2013. There’s big money to be made in the Arctic, and climate change is making that possible. “The popular perception is that Arctic warming is going to open some treasure trove of resources,” Smith says. That will be true in several industries. Tourism to the region is growing. Warmer waters have increased fish stocks. Offshore oil drilling is expected to boom. The region contains up to 22 percent of the world’s untapped oil and gas deposits. Longer summers and less ice have already given oil companies strong incentives to start exploration. Less ice also means more ships. Moving around the North Pole could slash shipping times—and costs—for many countries that would be happy to avoid the Suez or Panama canals. Russia and China in particular have shown interest in northern shipping routes. It’s this increased activity that has the Navy looking to plot a course for the frigid region—both to support commercial activity and to be of assistance if there is trouble. Preparations go from grand strategy to the more mundane. If the Navy is to operate seriously in the Arctic, it will need icebreakers, ships that do exactly what their name implies. Other Arctic states have invested heavily in these. Russia has 30, and Canada has 13. The United States has just three, all of which belong to the Coast Guard and are not powerful enough for Arctic operations. On the less expensive side of naval preparation are things like writing a new “Cold Weather Operations Handbook,” something the Navy hasn’t updated since 1987, according to Robert Freeman, a public affairs officer at the Navy’s Office of the Oceanographer. The old version is basically useless. For example, the old operations handbook suggests that if sea spray freezes on the outside of a ship, sailors should take a baseball bat to chip it away. That’s not going to work anymore, Freeman says. “In the modern Navy, we have all kinds of very sophisticated and intricate weapons systems on the surface of a ship. You can’t hit them with a baseball bat.” But even if there are challenges, there are also tailwinds making the Navy’s life easier. The Arctic remains one of the few areas where international cooperation is the norm rather than the exception. The region is governed through the Arctic Council, a forum in which Arctic states and interested observers iron out issues involving the region, from environmental protection to border disputes. When Russia planted a flag on the North Pole in 2007, many commentators speculated that it would launch a series of land grabs in the world’s least hospitable region. It never came to pass. Military-military cooperation abounds, too. U.S. naval officers engage in training exercises with Russian and Norwegian counterparts. The navies of Arctic countries share information and expertise on science and cartography. Even as tensions have flared between Russia and the United States in recent weeks over Ukraine, relations remain good on Arctic issues. “Russia does want to be a partner with the other Arctic states,” says Rear Admiral Jonathan White. “We’re not seeing anything to be concerned about.” The reason, according to White and independent Arctic analysts, comes back to money. “All the Arctic nations have things to gain, with additional access to resources, trade routes, fishing and tourism,” White says. “I’m optimistic that we can do it together. But just like any other ocean in the world, we have to be ready.”"
A Rare Arctic Land Sale Stirs Concerns in Norway,Iceland,"LONGYEARBYEN, NORWAY — For anyone in the market for a majestic waterfront property with easy access to the North Pole, Ole Einar Gjerde has a deal. “We will throw in the polar bears for free,” said Mr. Gjerde, pitching the attractions of a huge tract of Arctic land two and half times bigger than Manhattan but considerably less noisy. It has a human population of zero. But the sale of the property, across a frigid fjord from Longyearbyen, the capital of Norway’s northernmost territory, has kicked up a noisy storm fed by alarm over the Arctic ambitions of a Chinese real estate tycoon with deep pockets, a yen for ice and a murky past working for the Chinese Communist Party. The tycoon, Huang Nubo, was rebuffed last year in an attempt to buy a tract of frozen wilderness in Iceland and has turned his attentions to Norway. This summer he reached a preliminary deal to buy a large waterfront plot for about $4 million near the northern city of Tromso and, according to Norway’s state-owned broadcaster, is also eyeing a much bigger and even more northerly property here on Spitsbergen, the main island in the Svalbard archipelago. Mr. Huang’s company, Beijing Zhongkun Investment Group, denied reports in the Norwegian news media that it wants to buy land here in the high Arctic, and said it is focusing instead on plans for a luxury resort complex in Lyngen, a mountainous area on the Norwegian mainland near Tromso. That project, though centered on land much farther south than Svalbard, still puts Mr. Huang’s company inside the Arctic Circle and has set off a heated debate about his intentions. “No need to doubt that billionaire Huang Nubo is a straw man for the Chinese Communist Party and the country’s authorities,” warned a commentary[http://debatt.nordlys.no/article/ingen-trenger-tvile-pa] in Nordlys, northern Norway’s largest newspaper. Ola Giaever, the seller of the property near Tromso, said he had “100 percent confidence” that Mr. Huang was a straight-up businessman with no hidden agenda. “This is a business deal. Nothing else is going on,” Mr. Giaever said in a telephone interview. Such assurances, however, have done little to calm a frenzy of speculation about China seeking a permanent foothold in the Arctic, a region of growing geopolitical and economic significance as global warming opens new and cheaper shipping routes from Asia and also expands the prospects for exploiting the Arctic’s abundant natural resources. “For anyone interested in geopolitics, this is the region to follow in years to come,” said Willy Ostreng, the president of the Norwegian Scientific Academy for Polar Research[http://www.polar-academy.com/pages/AcademyHistory.htm]. Mr. Huang, he added, “might be just another smiling businessman” genuinely interested in simply developing tourism, but “we are talking about perceptions here.” “And the perception is that China wants a foothold in the Arctic.” Hungry for energy, China has “openly declared its Arctic ambitions,” said Mr. Ostreng, noting that Beijing had invested in an icebreaker, the Snow Dragon; sent scientists to Svalbard to join teams of international researchers; and successfully lobbied to become an observer at the Arctic Council[http://www.arctic-council.org/index.php/en/], a grouping of nations with Arctic land, including Norway, Russia and the United States. It has also tried, so far without success, to get permission to build a large radar antenna on Svalbard. China has even declared itself a “near Arctic state,” a big stretch as even its northernmost region lies more than 1,000 miles from the Arctic Circle. But, Mr. Ostreng said, “When you are a big country, you can claim to be whatever you want, and people believe you.” Wariness of China’s intentions have been fueled in part by the widespread bewilderment here over China’s relentless efforts to punish Norway over the Norwegian Nobel Committee’s decision to honor Liu Xiaobo[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/09/world/09nobel.html], a jailed Chinese dissident, with the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. Furious at the award, China has been on a four-year diplomatic tantrum, repeatedly snubbing Norwegian officials, slashing imports of Norwegian salmon and hectoring Norway for showing insufficient contrition for an award over which the government had no control. Mr. Huang first attracted attention and suspicion in 2012 when he tried to buy a desolate, 100-square-mile tract of land in northern Iceland, saying he wanted to build a golf course and a high-end hotel[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/world/europe/iceland-baffled-by-chinese-plan-for-golf-resort.html] for Chinese tourists. The project fell apart after baffled Icelandic officials invoked laws restricting foreign ownership of land. In the case of Svalbard, however, Norway is barred by the 1920 Svalbard Treaty from imposing any such restrictions. The treaty granted Norway “absolute sovereignty” over the Arctic Archipelago, but also committed it to grant “complete equality” in the purchase and development of Svalbard land to the nationals of all the countries that signed the original treaty, or, like China, joined it later. When the  treaty was signed[http://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/01/1-11/svalbard-treaty.xml] as part of the Versailles negotiations after World War I, the main economic activities on Svalbard were coal mining and fur trapping. Global warming and new technologies, however, mean that Svalbard now sits in the middle of what, in coming decades, is expected to be an Arctic gold rush. The Arctic region[http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=4650], according to the United States Energy Information Administration, holds around 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil and 30 percent of its natural gas, reserves that have been untouched because of the difficulty and high cost of their development. Russia, which recently announced plans to invest $400 billion on extracting Arctic resources over the next 20 years, believes the region has even more promise, though these plans could be disrupted by Western sanctions imposed over Ukraine. Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft, Russia’s state oil company, has said the Arctic holds over 20 percent of the world’s oil reserves. He also indicated that Russia, despite its increasingly warm relations with China, was uneasy about Beijing’s push into the Arctic, warning that Russia faced “plenty of competition,” not only from nations with well-established Arctic claims like Canada, Norway and the United States, but also “countries which seem to be far from the Arctic,” including China and “even Singapore,” a tropical nation 4,500 miles from the Arctic. “The struggle for resources is getting tougher,” Mr. Sechin said. The land now up for sale, owned by the descendants of a Norwegian shipper who acquired it in 1937, is the first property on Svalbard to go on the market since 1952, and is the only privately held territory left. All the rest is owned by the Norwegian state; a Norwegian state coal company, Store Norske; and a Russian state-owned coal company, the Arctic Coal Trust. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is unique,” said Mr. Gjerde (pronounced gyer-DA), a friend of the family that owns the land and a board member of Austre Adventfjord AS, a company set up last year to manage the property. Henning Horn, a Norwegian industrialist and farmer who owns the property along with other descendants of the original purchaser, is the chairman. Mr. Horn declined, through his lawyer, to be interviewed. When Norwegian news media first reported the planned sale in April[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/svalbard-eiendom-kan-bli-solgt-til-utlandet/a/10130839/] and then named Mr. Huang as a possible buyer, the government immediately came under pressure in Parliament and in the news media to make sure the land did not fall into foreign hands. “Norway cannot take this risk. This is a matter of strategic importance for us,” Liv Signe Navarsete, a former minister and member of the Norwegian Parliament said in an interview. Norway, she added, is open to foreign investment, but after being browbeaten by Beijing for so long over the Nobel Peace Prize, it has no reason to roll out the welcome mat for a Chinese investor in the Arctic. Norwegian officials, she said, have bent over backward to calm Chinese fury over the prize, accepting China as an observer in the Arctic Council, a position denied to the European Union, and refusing to meet Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, during a visit to the Norwegian capital, Oslo, in May. But China has still kept Norway in the deep freeze “to show the world that if you don’t do what they want, you will suffer,” Ms. Navarsete said. Amid a rising clamor against any foreign sale, the government announced in May that it would work to ensure that the Svalbard property remained in Norwegian hands. “The government has decided to work for a solution involving a state takeover,” the trade minister, Monica Maeland, said in a statement[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/nfd/pressesenter/pressemeldinger/2014/Norske-myndigheter-arbeider-for-a-sikre-Austre-Adventfjord-for-allmenheten.html?id=760699]. “It is entirely natural and right that the state is committed to taking over the property.” Efforts to secure state control have yet to bear fruit. Christin Kristoffersen, the mayor of Longyearbyen, Svalbard’s administrative center, said she supported a purchase by the Norwegian state to make sure the region’s fragile wilderness areas do not get swept up in a chaotic rush to exploit Arctic resources. “This is not an area for a new Klondike. We have to tread carefully,” the mayor said. “We should own this island. This is not anti-Chinese, but pro-Norwegian.” Svalbard’s governor, Odd Olsen Ingero, also wants the state to step in, but stressed that even a private buyer would have to abide by strict zoning and environmental regulations. “Starting a hotel over there is unthinkable,” the governor said. Representatives for the owners say the state is welcome to submit a bid but must follow market rules. “We are not in politics or geopolitics. We are in business. We will sell to the highest bidder,” said Arnstein Martin Skaare, a board member of the company managing the sale. “If Norway thinks this land is important for Norway, then it will buy it for a fair market price.” What this price might be is a mystery, with estimates ranging from a few million dollars to over a billion. “You can’t put a price on something that is unique,” said Mr. Ostreng, the polar research expert, noting that property came for sale so rarely in the high Arctic that there was no functioning market to establish even its approximate worth. The property’s immediate economic value, he said, is minimal, as its principal asset, coal, has only lost money for those mining elsewhere on Svalbard. “But if you add in strategic value,” he said, “the price of this land is incalculable.” * Day for Night in Norway[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/travel/day-for-night-in-norway.html] * Along the Oslo Fjord, an Arts District Springs Up[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/travel/along-the-oslo-fjord-an-arts-district-springs-up.html]"
"TV chef Tom Kerridge blasted for eating a PUFFIN on trip to Iceland - as well as whale, horse and even guillemot",Iceland,"* Chef sampled Iceland's culinary delicacies saying 'love food experiences' * But he was criticised by animal campaigners for eating puffin on his trip * There are more than 15million puffins worldwide but numbers are declining * In UK, puffins are protected on amber list of Birds of Conservation Concern The new chef on the BBC's flagship programme 'Food and Drink' has ruffled feathers when he admitted to eating a puffin bird on a trip to Iceland. Tom Kerridge, 41, who landed the job as co-host for Food and Drink on BBC Two this year, revealed how he was 'en route to a puffin lunch'.  He later said: 'Today I've eaten puffin, guillemot, whale and horse', before adding 'gotta love food experiences'.  But the TV chef, who began cooking as an 18-year-old commis chef in his native Gloucestershire, was blasted by animal campaigners last night.  Mimi Bekhechi, of the campaigning group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, told the Sun on Sunday: 'He's showing himself to be colder than the weather in Iceland.'  On Twitter, Donna Brown wrote: 'Puffins are endangered Tom, poor show mate even for a chef.'  There are more than 15million puffins worldwide but numbers are declining rapidly.  In the UK puffins are protected on the amber list of Birds of Conservation Concern.  Bird charity the RSPB said puffins are 'protected at all times' - which means they are safeguarded by law.  RISE OF TV CHEF TOM KERRIDGE Since starting out as a commis chef, Mr Kerridge quickly climbed up the industry ladder and opened his own gastropub, the Hand and Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, in 2005.  Within a year it had won a Michelin star, and it was awarded a second in 2012. In 2013, he presented his own food programme Tom Kerridge's Proper pub food and then in spring 2014, he hosted Spring kitchen with Tom Kerridge, which was aired in a daytime viewing slot on BBC One. This year, he became the new co-host for Food and Drink. This is not the first time a TV chef has attracted criticism for eating a puffin.  A total of 42 viewers complained to Ofcom in 2008 when Gordon Ramsay caught and ate a puffin on his Channel 4 show, the F word.  Ramsay went 'sky fishing' for the puffins using a large net to 'fish' the birds out of the sky Their necks were broken and they were skinned, with their hearts then taken out to eat.  Iceland has the world's largest puffin breeding colony. In the country, whale meat is commonly found on menus to the consternation of some tourists.  It is usually soaked first in milk to extract some of the oil and then served as medallions or streaks.  Puffin and guillemot - which once saved destitute Icelanders from starvation - are now considered something of a delicacy. A particular favourite is smoked puffin, which is served up with a blueberry sauce.   A spokesman for Mr Kerridge told the Sun on Sunday: 'Tom would never knowingly eat an endangered species. He is aware that puffin are not endangered in Iceland.'   MailOnline has contacted the BBC for a contact.  "
Magnetic north,Iceland,"Features | THE BIG READ Never mind Scandi-noir, the zeitgeist is creeping upwards - to the Arctic Circle. GERARD GILBERT considers the pull the pole has always exerted on us, from Greek myth to the new TV thriller 'Fortitude' When writer Simon Donald was a teenager in early 1980s Scotland, he used tell people that when he grew up he hoped to join the British Antarctic Survey team. He wasn't sure where this ambition came from but, he says: ""Here was something about the extremes, the purity and the starkness. Everything is crystal, clear and defined… unlike adolescence"". The poles answer many calls, it seems, including the confused yelps of pre-adulthood. It was ever thus. The ""Frozen North"", the Arctic, was once a pristine adventure playground for the curious and the greedy and - as a Norwegian ship's captain in Michelle Paver's polar ghost story Dark Matter puts it - ""where you can breathe with both lungs"". But it's also a metaphor, a state of mind, an otherness and a damned good setting for a story. The last great wilderness, you might call it if you didn't fear sounding like a clichéd script for a nature documentary. And in our increasingly over-heated planet it seems that we are increasingly attracted to the cold. Certainly television drama has been steadily heading in that direction. Like 16th-century explorers mapping out the terra incognita to the north of Newfoundland, Norway and Greenland, where their charts blurred and the cartographer's imagination took over (""here be dragons""), so television drama is giving us an ever fuller picture of the frigid climes. From its base camp in Copenhagen, home of The Killing and Borgen, it crossed the Oresund strait to the Malmo of The Bridge before striking out for Norway, setting for the political thriller Mammon and the comedy Lilyhammer, with an idiosyncratic detour to Iceland - where The Night Shift brought the more adventurous BBC4 viewer a workplace sitcom whose ""sit"" was a service station outside Reykjavik. Now, with Simon Donald's 12-part Sky Atlantic thriller Fortitude, the new box-set age of prestige television drama has at last unambiguously breached the Arctic Circle. Despite actually being filmed in Iceland, which is sub-Arctic, Fortitude is set further north, in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, or Spitsbergen as it was first named by its Dutch discoverer, William Barents, whose name lingers in the Barents Sea. Donald tells me that he first settled on an Arctic setting because what his story needed was permafrost. Fair enough - and it beats, say, the freezer storage unit in an abattoir. When Sky Atlantic came into the picture, he also required a mainly British cast, and so Michael Gambon, Jessica Raine and Christopher Eccleston - as well as the American Stanley Tucci and the Danish Sofie Grabol - are to be found in his fictional Svalbard town. This is a land where polar bears roam, but no Eskimos - at least in the first two episodes of Fortitude. Maybe they don't exist in Svalbard. According to the writer A. A. Gill, ""Svalbard was too hardcore even for Eskimos"". It does mean ""cold coast"" in Norwegian. There are several etymological theories about the term Eskimo, some claiming it derives from the Inuit word for ""eaters of raw meat"" - hence one reason why it's now frowned upon. The Inuit word for Europeans is ""kabloona"", which is supposed to refer to our bushy eyebrows - well-groomed Europeans presumably being rare in those parts. Kabloona is also the title of a terrific 1939 travel book by the aristocratic French adventurer Gontran de Poncins, who spent a year living with the indigenous people of the Canadian Arctic, gradually coming to respect their ways. But for most of its literary history, the Arctic has been empty space. When I ask him about the attractions of an Arctic setting, Donald says that it's ""the isolation… the fact that you're locked in… the Arctic is a wonderful intensifier."" Good conditions for sitcoms, and also for horror stories. Donald had originally intended to write a horror film - his primary influences being John Carpenter's 1982 movie The Thing, in which a parasitical alien lifeform emerged from the ice, and Dan Simmons's novel The Terror, in which the American horror writer speculated on the fate of Captain Franklin's ill-fated 1840s expedition to find the Northwest Passage. In Simmons's 2007 novel, the survivors are stalked by a supernatural creature, and the author won't have been the first to connect the Arctic with monsters - in fact the link has an impeccable provenance in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, with its first and last scenes set on the polar ice cap. ""I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation,"" says Robert Walton, the narrator of Shelley's Gothic novel. ""It ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. The sun is forever visible… there the snow and frost are banished."" Fat chance of that, but then Shelley, as late as the 19th-century, was merely reflecting an idyllic vision of the Arctic handed down by the Ancient Greeks, with their mythical Hyperborea, where the north wind (the ""borea"") came from. Counter-intuitively, the Greeks believed that at the very top of the world sat a tropical paradise set in balmy seas. Talk about packing the wrong clothes. The polar ice cap of course is nothing but frozen sea - shrinking and expanding according to the seasons - and a scientific impossibility according to those kings and queens who funded expeditions to find a northern sea passage to China and India. The Elizabethan privateer Martin Frobisher was among the first of these entrepreneurs, and Frobisher's insistence that the tusked narwhals he encountered were a species of unicorn must have seemed entirely plausible to the 16th-century mind. Other tales spoke of pygmies, dragons, epic whirlpools and of a mysterious black rock that stood at the North Pole itself. Believers in a hollow earth - who thought there was another world beneath this one's surface - held the entrance to this nether world would be found in the Arctic. But those hardy realists, the whalers, reignited interest in the Northwest Passage when they reported that the ice cap was melting. It may be a case of the literary imagination pre-empting events that the year of Frankenstein's publication, 1818, also saw the first serious British polar expedition in more than 100 years, as Sir John Ross undertook the first of three trips around the Canadian Arctic islands - the final 1850 voyage being undertaken to look for his naval colleague, Sir John Franklin, whose mysterious fate gripped the world for the next decade. Jack London was the most celebrated Victorian-Edwardian chronicler of the hardships of life in the Arctic, with his two classics set amid the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon - Call of the Wild and White Fang. A more contemporary account of the difficulties - physical and psychological - posed by early Arctic exploration are offered in the aforementioned Dark Matter, Michelle Paver's 2010 ghost story that follows a 1930s expedition into the heart of darkness of a polar winter. Paver's novel, which is currently being turned into a film by the makers of Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, is in a long line of fiction that imagines there is something malevolent out there in the snow. Fred Schepisi's 1984 thoughtful sci-fi flick, Iceman, depicts a prehistoric man whose body is thawed out of the ice after 40,000 years - a modern-day Frankenstein's monster - misunderstood, frightened and alone. In the 2007 Josh Hartnett movie 30 Days of Night, a small Alaskan town is besieged by vampires, while in the current television series Helix, a team investigates a viral outbreak at an arctic bio-research station, only to discover that genetic boffins are transforming humans in a nefarious way. At the end of the Second World War, one of the more outré theories concerning renegade Nazis was that they had holed up in the Arctic - home of their Aryan descendants according to the mystics of the Thule Society, who believed that blond-haired, blue-eyed Europeans did not emerge out of Africa, but from a long-vanished race of northern supermen (Himmler was, needless to say, a keen supporter of this theory). And when the flying-saucer phenomenon first emerged in the late 1940s, one particularly imaginative magazine editor hypothesised that they were the experimental warplanes of these fugitive Nazis. The frosty tentacles of the Cold War eventually embraced the polar north, too. It was a strange irony of the clash of the two mid-20th century superpowers that while they fought their proxy wars in Africa and South-east Asia, their own landmasses abutted in the Arctic, a short 50-mile hop across the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska. The maps in Dr Strangelove that trace the progress of the intercontinental nuclear warplanes brought home the proximity. A year before Stanley Kubrick's classic satire, Alistair Maclean's adventure novel Ice Station Zebra (filmed in 1968 with Rock Hudson) exploited the public's fascination with nuclear submarines and their ability to sail underneath the Arctic ice. Maclean returned to an Arctic setting with his 1971 murder mystery Bear Island - whose plot was substantially altered in the 1978 film of the same name (starring Donald Sutherland and Vanessa Redgrave), to include one of the earliest storylines involving climate change. What unites all these stories is their sense of the Arctic as a hostile and empty wasteland, visited only by a handful of intrepid European and American explorers. What they tend to ignore is the native Inuit of Greenland, Canada and Alaska, and the smaller Yupik population of Siberia and Alaska. It is a lack that has been redressed in more recent Arctic fiction, most notably in Danish writer Peter Hoeg's inspired 1992 novel Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow, with its spunky eponymous half-Greenlander heroine. In Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner - the first ever feature written and acted entirely in Inuktitut and the top-grossing Canadian movie of 2002 - the action is set in the ancient past and retells an Inuit legend where the monster is an ill-willed shaman. So where are today's yearned-for empty spaces? Space itself? Too remote for anyone except Richard Branson. Cyberspace? Too populous, although some people deprived of their internet might possibly feel like Sir John Franklin as ice entombed his ship. Meanwhile, intercontinental airliners hourly criss-cross the continent, mining companies sniff out oil and gas, satellites map every inch and even middle-income tourists can watch the Northern Lights or take their children to pester Santa Claus. But, as American archaeologist Robert McGhee puts it in his 2007 book The Last Imaginary Place: A Human History of the Arctic World: ""The legend of the Arctic as a distant paradise has been with us since the time of Homer, and a myth of such antiquity will not fade away merely because of the ephemeral reports of a few Arctic explorers, or the scanning eyes of satellites."" 'Fortitude' begins on Sky Atlantic on Thursday 29 January at 9pm."

(20 marks) Part B and C These are 30 mark essays. You should aim to write about one and a half pages and allow 15 minutes for each essay. There's no need for any general introductory comments or summary at the end of your essay. You will get marks by providing good accurate, factual information that shows you can use the correct terminology to describe the various processes at work in shaping the landscape. As you come across new and unfamiliar words while studying geography, these are the words that you need to focus on until you become confident in being able to use them in an exam situation. EXAM TIP One question that has been asked every year since 2006 relates to the formation of a landform. In 2012 a landform of deposition was specified, while in 2013 a landform of erosion was specified. In 2014 a landform of erosion and a landform of deposition were required. You should learn one landform of deposition and one landform of erosion as there is a good chance that you will get to use such an essay in the exam. LANDFORM DEVELOPMENT Marking scheme 2009 Question 1A Landform identified (2 marks) One named process (2 marks) Examine with the aid of a labelled diagram/diagrams, the processes which have shaped one Irish landform of your choice. (30 marks) Irish example (2 marks) Labelled diagrams (4 marks graded) Examination, 10 x SRPs Answer The formation of a waterfall is a landform of erosion. Irish examples include: Powerscourt, Co Wicklow and Mahon Falls, Co Waterford. 1. Waterfalls are usually found in the upper course of a river where the gradient is at its steepest and therefore the velocity of the river is fast. 2. When the river courses over resistant bedrock, such as granite, erosion happens slowly. Where the river courses over less resistant bedrock, such as shale, the rate of erosion will be faster. This process is known as differential erosion. 3. This differential erosion eventually produces a drop in the river's profile where two bands of hard and softer rock meet. As the water flows over this step its velocity increases and therefore the force of hydraulic action at this point is increased. 4. The sediment load within the river will also erode the river's bed at this point via the process of abrasion. A deep pool known as a plunge-pool then develops. 5. As water falls into the plunge-pool there is great turbulence which creates eddying currents and whirlpools, further deepening the plunge-pool. Falling water creates splashes which eventually undercuts the adjacent rock-face until an overhang is produced. 6. As the undercutting continues the overhang becomes more pronounced until it becomes unstable and eventually it will collapse under the force of gravity. 7. This causes the waterfall to retreat upstream in a process known as headward erosion. 8. As the waterfall retreats upstream it may form a narrow steep-sided canyon called a gorge. 9. There are other possible causes for the formation of waterfalls apart from differential erosion. If a river courses over a fault line along which vertical displacement of land has occurred this can produce the drop in the river's profile necessary to create a waterfall. 10.In glaciated valleys tributary glaciers do not erode as deeply as the main glacier. As a result rivers which flow along hanging valleys often enter the main U-shaped valley/glacial trough via a waterfall. One such waterfall can be seen at the Poulanass waterfall in the Glendalough Valley in Co Wicklow. THE ROCK CYCLE Topics within this aspect of physical geography include igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, how limestone is chemically weathered to produce karst landscapes and how humans interact with the rock cycle. 2010 Question 2C Humans interact with the rock cycle in many ways. Discuss this with reference to any one human interaction that you have studied. (30 marks) Marking scheme Interaction identified (2 marks) Example (2 marks) Answer Geothermal energy in Iceland. Discussion (13 x SRPs) 1. Geothermal energy is produced by using heat within the earth's crust to generate hot water and electricity. The earth's core is 5000°C. Looking to the future: Yeats College students looking at college options 2. Convection currents in the mantle transfer this heat towards the earth's crust. 3. Normally the earth's crust is too thick (15 -30 km) for the transfer of heat from the mantle to the upper parts of the crust to make exploitation of geothermal energy commercially viable. However, where the earth's crust is thin, such as at divergent plate boundaries or over hotspots (e.g Hawaii), huge sources of heat are close enough to the surface to be of great use to humans. 4. Iceland is a volcanic island that was formed along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where the Eurasian and North American plates are diverging at an average rate of 2.5 cm per year. 5. Iceland's thin crust allows for the generation of 26% of its electricity needs from geothermal energy. 6. Iceland has seven geothermal power plants, and geothermal energy is used to provide hot water for 89% of Iceland's housing. 7. Because this source of energy is so cheap and plentiful the footpaths in Reykjavik are heated to prevent frost and ice. 8. Hot water is also pumped into greenhouses in Iceland where fruits and vegetables can be grown. 9. Iceland has developed a major aluminium smelting industry. This is a very energy intensive process so aluminium smelting plants are only built where there is a plentiful supply of cheap energy available locally. 10. Iceland plans to sell electricity generated from geothermal energy via undersea cables measuring 1,200km which will connect Iceland to the UK and the wider European electrical grid. 11. Geothermal energy acts as a tourist attraction in Iceland. A geothermal power plant pumps 40°C water into a nearby lake to produce mineral rich bathing water. A hotel complex has been developed at this site known as 'the Blue Lagoon'. 12.The Geysir area is famous for its mudpools, hot-springs and geysers and is one of Iceland's major tourist attractions. 13.Geothermal energy is a renewable form of energy as the source of heat at the core will be available for billions of years to come. By using geothermal energy sources the use of fossil fuels is reduced, thereby reducing the amount of CO2 and other harmful greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere. Regional geography (80 marks) Questions 4, 5 and 6 are on regional geography. You must do one of these three questions. Each question is divided into three parts. Part A is worth 20 marks. Five minutes is the most you should spend on this. Parts B and C are both 30-mark essays. You should allow 15 minutes for each essay. The following topics tend to be examined in the 20 mark questions: › Sketch maps of Irish, European and Sub-continental regions. › Interpreting data presented in graphs. › Identifying the various classifications by which regions can be defined. EXAM TIP If you need to draw a sketch map of an Irish region you will be able to draw a much better outline of Ireland if you are looking at a map of Ireland. Have a look through the entire exam paper. More likely than not, there will be a diagram or an outline map of Ireland somewhere as part of a question. If there isn't, then go to the Ordnance Survey map where you will find a small outline of Ireland on the reverse side of the map, which includes the key and national grid of Ireland. 2012 Question 6A Examine the graph above and answer the following questions: (i) How many euro-zone countries had a budget deficit greater than the euro-zone average in 2010? Six (ii) What was the difference in the budget deficit (as a percentage of gross domestic product) between Ireland and Austria in 2010? 9.2% (iii) Name two of the six founding member states of what is now the EU. France, West Germany (also Italy, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg) (iv) Name two EU member states not in the euro-zone. UK and Sweden (v) Briefly explain what is meant by the 'Euro-crisis'. This refers to the sovereign debt crisis in euro-zone countries such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain. In Ireland the bursting of the Celtic Tiger property bubble bankrupted many banks. The Irish governnment then took over the bad debts of the banks and the borrowing required to bail-out the banks greatly increased Ireland's national debt which then required harsh austerity measures.

Britain (iii) Calculate X, the total number of tourists visiting Ireland in 2009? 2,931,000 (iv) Name any two Irish tourist attractions. The Giant's Causeway, The Burren (v) Briefly explain why the number of tourists visiting Ireland is decreasing. The biggest decline in visitors has been from Britain. The value of the euro against the pound sterling has been increasing, this has made Ireland a more expensive destination for British tourists. The international recession which began in 2007/2008 has reduced the disposable income of many which has curtailed spending on non-essentials such as holiday-making. The Cliffs of Moher, Co Clare 2012 Question 6B Discuss the factors that influence the development of one tertiary economic activity in an Irish region that you have studied. (30 marks) Marking scheme Tertiary economic activity named (2 marks) Two factors identified (2+2 marks) Examination, 12 x SRPs Answer Tourism in the Greater Dublin Area region Factor 1: Good transport links 1. International tourism is dependent on good transport facilities. Dublin airport is central to the region's tourism industry. Dublin airport provides direct flights between Europe, North America and Asia. 2. Plans to connect the airport to the city centre by a metro line have been abandoned. Dublin Bus runs a bus service between Busarus and the airport. 3. Ryanair had a revolutionary impact on the Irish air industry and subsequently the region's tourism industry. Cheap air fares have resulted in Dublin becoming one of Europe's top 5 city-break destinations. 4. Dublin Port and Dun Laoghaire provide ferry services to Holyhead and Liverpool. Tourists from the UK can travel with their cars or as foot passengers. 5. Tourists from within Ireland are also a valuable source of income for the region's tourism sector. Dublin is at the nodal point of Ireland's motorway network, with roads such as the M1, M4, M7 and M11 all converging on Dublin. The motorways have greatly reduced the journey times to Dublin. 6. Within Dublin rail services such as the DART and LUAS allow tourists to see the various tourist attractions. Factor 2: Wide variety of entertainment 7. Dublin is famous for its lively nightlife. Temple Bar has many pubs and restaurants and is very popular with British stag and hen parties. 8. The Aviva stadium is home to the Irish rugby and soccer teams. The 6 Nations competition during the Spring brings English, Welsh, Scottish, French and Italian rugby fans to Dublin. 9. Croke Park is the headquarters of the GAA. The All-Ireland final weekends in September are huge boosts to Dublin's tourism industry. 10. Dublin is the cultural capital of Ireland and has a wide variety of theatres, galleries and museums. The Book of Kells in Trinity College is a major tourist attraction. 11. Dublin Zoo is the most visited paying tourist attraction in Ireland and is popular with families with young children. 12. There are several seaside resorts along the east coast that have developed along sandy beaches, such as Brittas Bay in Co. Wicklow and Laytown in Co Meath. Trinity College Library Electives (80 marks) Section 2 of the exam relates to the electives. These are questions 7 to 12. You must answer ONE question from either: Patterns and Processes in Economic activities OR Patterns and Processes in the Human Environment You must do one of the three questions from within your chosen elective. Each question is divided into three parts. Part A is worth 20 marks. Five minutes is the most you should spend on this. Parts B and C are both 30 mark essays. You should allow 15 minutes for each essay. The following topics tend to be examined in the 20 mark questions; › Drawing sketch maps from OS maps and aerial photographs. › Presenting data in a graph. › Interpreting data presented in graphs. Patterns and processes in economic activities elective EXAM TIP When drawing a sketch map from an aerial photograph or an OS map it is essential that you draw the frame correctly, if you don't do this everything within your frame will be wrong. Using a ruler, measure the length and height of the photo/OS map. Halve these dimensions and then draw your frame onto the graph paper. Now write in a title. Now that your frame is half the scale of the original, you can use your ruler to take any measurement from the original, halve it and then transfer this onto your sketch. This technique will ensure that all your features are in the correct location and to the correct scale.

Examine the above statement with reference to example(s) that you have studied. (30 marks) Pollution source identified (2 marks) Impact outside source (2 marks) 1. Burning fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, coal and peat releases carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which traps long-wave radiation, which in turns leads to warming of the atmosphere. This is known as the enhanced greenhouse effect. 2. As temperatures rise at the poles ice-sheets are melting at an alarming rate in Greenland and Antarctica. The low-lying island nation of the Maldives would be totally submerged by a 1 metre rise in sea-levels. 3. As the atmospehere warms the oceans warm. This leads to thermal expansion, which also creates rises in sea-level. 4. As the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere rises the oceans absorb more CO2. This increases the acidity of the ocean. Ocean acidification is having negative impacts on marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs. 5. As the greenhouse effect traps more heat within the atmosphere this is having a destabilising effect on climate patterns. 2014 was the hottest year on record and all of the 10 hottest years have been recorded since 1998. 6. Some regions, such as the Sahel region, are experiencing hotter temperatures and more regular and more severe droughts. The Sahel has historically contributed very little to CO2 levels in the atmosphere but is one of the areas being hardest hit by global warming. 7. As temperatures rise the amount of evaporation and hence precipitation is also increasing. The Indian Monsoon and the Asian typhoons are likely to lead to ever greater loss of life due to flooding and landslides on densely populated slopes. 8. As temperatures rise the range of tropical diseases carried by mosquitoes will increase. Densely populated areas in the highlands of Papua-New Guinea, which are currently above the mosquito line, may become habitable for mosquitoes as temperatures rise. This would lead to higher rates of malaria. 9. Rising temperatures in the Russian tundra is causing the permafrost to melt. The permafrost contains vast amounts of the very powerful greenhouse gas methane. As more methane is released into the atmosphere this could act as a tipping point that leads to run-away global warming. 10. With increased global warming Ireland is likely to see storms of greater intensity during the winter months. Increasing rates of wind and flood damage have already led to a rise in insurance premiums. 11. Ireland and Britain are also likely to face more heatwaves and drought during the summer months. During the heatwave of 2003 temperatures of 380C were recorded in London. 12. Much of the Indian subcontinent's population is dependent on meltwater derived from glaciers in the Himalayas. If these glaciers were to melt completely agriculture and human settlement within the region would be greatly threatened.

Marking scheme 2006 Question 12C (30 marks) ""The area shown on the Ordnance Survey map that accompanies this paper indicates evidence of a wide variety of historic settlement."" Three historical settlements (10 marks each) Settlement identified (2 marks) Map reference (2 marks) Examine this statement using map evidence, with reference to any three aspects of settlement. (30 marks) examination (3 x SRPs at 2 marks each) Answer On this extract there is evidence of settlement from the three following historic eras: the Iron Age, the Early Christian Age and the Anglo-Norman Age. Iron Age • During the Iron Age (400 BC-400AD) Celtic people came to Ireland. Ringforts are associated with these people. There is one present at S 421 199. This is a typical site for a ringfort as this raised site and sloping land would have allowed for good drainage. • There is an ogham stone present at S 421 187. These were stones used to mark out boundaries or to commemorate significant leaders. A series of lines and dots were notched along the edge of these stones. • There is a hillfort at S 36 28. This was a defensive feature built on top of a hill with commanding views over the Suir Valley to the south. Early Christian • There is abundant evidence of settlements dating from the early Christian period (400AD-1100AD). There is a holy well at S 442 283. These wells were used in religious ceremonies and were usually dedicated to local saints. • There is a high cross at S 413 291. These were used to illustrate scenes from the bible for a population within which the vast majority were illiterate. • There is a derelict church adjacent to Ahenny High Cross at S 413 292. This church probably dates from the Early Christian period. It would have been used for mass and administering the various sacraments such as baptism and marriages. Anglo-Norman period • There is a castle at S 405 206. The Normans built stone castles from which they defended the land that they had conquered. This site is a strategic position as it overlooks a bridging point on the River Suir. • Remnants of a town wall can be seen at S 40 21. The Normans built walls around their towns with gates and watchtowers. The walls were defensive features. The walls and gates were also used to control trade and taxation within the town. • Townslands that end in suffix 'town' can be taken as evidence of Anglo-Norman settlement. On this map extract townslands such as Newtown, Castletown, Mainstown and Joanstown are all located on low-lying , and probably fertile land that the Normans settled on. Dunluce Castle, Co Antrim Options (80 marks) Those taking the Ordinary Level paper will not be examined on this part of the course. Higher levels students are required to study one of the following four options: › Global interdependence › Geoecology › Culture and identity › The atmosphere-ocean environment Within each option there are three essay questions and you must do one of them. You should allow 35 minutes for this question. The structure of your essay is very important. At the beginning of your answer set out what the three or four 'aspects' of your answer are going to be. It's best to try identify four aspects within your answer. Think of each aspect as a mini-essay within the larger essay. If you have identified four aspects then you will need to provide six SRPs for each of your four aspects to gain full marks. If you have identified three aspects then you will need to provide eight SRPs for each of these aspects in order to secure full marks. 2008 Geoecology option, Question 18 Describe and explain the main characteristics of one biome that you have studied. (80 marks) Answer The tropical rainforest biome Aspect 1: Climate 1. This biome is found within 200 north and south of the equator. The sun is directly overhead at noon and the sun's rays strike the ground at a very high angle. The average temperature is around 250C with no seasonal variability. 2. The daily temperature range is only around 50C. Humidity levels are typically between 85 and 90%. 3. The biome lies within the Inter-tropical convergence zone. This is a low-pressure belt that is driven by the rapidly rising air created by the heating of the ground around the equator and the convergence of equator bound trade winds. 4. As the moisture laden air rises it cools and condenses. This gives rise to intense convectional rainfall which usually begins in the early afternoon. 5. Annual rainfall levels vary between 2500mm and 5000mm. 6. Transpiration of moisture through the forest canopy creates up to 50% of the precipitation within the tropical rainforest. Aspect 2: Soils 1. Tropical red soils, or latosols are very deep, usually up to 30 metres deep. The red colour comes from the presence of iron oxide (Fe2O3) and aluminium oxide (Al2O3). 2. The high availability of water and high temperatures means the rate of chemical weathering of the underlying bedrock is very rapid. This soil formation process is called laterisation. 3. These soils have a very thin O horizon. The plant litter from the canopy is rapidly decomposed by the abundant microscopic and insect life. The humus content in the A horizon is therefore low. 4. These soils are acidic. Soluble base minerals tend to be leached downwards due to the rapid percolation of water. 5. These soils have a very short nutrient cycle. If the canopy is removed the O and A horizon quickly lose their nutrients due to the leaching created by the heavy rainfall. 6. Once the forest has been cleared the rate of transpiration drops and cloud cover is reduced, as is precipitation. The soils quickly lose their moisture and a hard infertile crust will form which renders the soil infertile. These crust-like soils are called laterites (meaning 'bricklike'). Aspect 3: Flora 1. The vegetation is dominated by tall trees such as mahogany and teak. The trees are broad leafed and evergreen as the absence of seasonality means they can grow all year round. 2. The large trees have shallow and buttress root systems which absorb nutrients from the A and O horizons. 3. Plants and trees compete for solar insolation which is necessary for photosynthesis. Those species that evolved to grow higher than other species enjoyed an adaptive advantage. Trees can grow as high as 70 metres. 4. The emergent layer is the highest level in the forest. Leaves in this layer are smaller as there is less competition for light at these heights. The leaves are waxy as they have adapted in order to retain moisture in a hot breezy environment. 5. The canopy layer is between 20 and 40 metres from the forest floor. Leaves in this layer need to be very large in order to trap the reduced amount of available sunlight. Vines and other climber species (epiphytes) gain access to sunlight by growing up along the trunks of the tall trees. 6. The forest floor is very dark and hence very little vegetation can grow here. When a large tree falls or is destroyed by lighting a clearing will allow new plants to take root and grow and the canopy will usually re-establish itself within 20 years. Aspect 4: Fauna 1. This biome has huge biodiversity as it contains half of the world's faunal species. Birds such as parrots and toucans are attracted to the canopy layer where they feed on fruits and seeds. 2. The Capuchin monkey is found in the forests of South Central America. They have prehensile tails and toes that have adapted for grasping branches. They only come down to the forest floor to drink. 3. Large predators such as the jaguar and anaconda inhabit the forest floor. These predators have stripes or spots which helps to conceal themselves from their intended prey by camouflaging themselves. 4. The flying squirrel has evolved flaps of skin between their legs that allow them to glide from tree to tree where they feed on fruits, insects and nuts. 5. Winds are not strong in this biome so plants are very dependent on animals to both pollinate their flowers and to transport their seeds. Flowers and fruits are very colourful in order to attract animals. 6. The Brazilian sloth has an extremely low metabolism which allows them to survive on leaves alone. They spend 80% of the day asleep and are effectively camouflaged within the canopy. Condensed version Climate: 1. 100 north south, 250C 2. Daily temperature range 50C, humidity 85% 3.

Kerry to visit Arctic amid concern over ice melt,Iceland,"Secretary of State John Kerry will visit the Arctic Circle next week for key ministerial talks on climate change amid global concerns about rising seas and accelerating ice melt. Global warming is happening twice as fast in the Arctic than elsewhere on the planet and many fear not only devastating impacts of warming but also from an influx of people and industry on the pristine environment, wildlife and Inuit culture. Kerry will attend a meeting of the Arctic Council in the northwestern Canadian town of Iqaluit, on Baffin Island. The United States on April 24 formally takes over the two-year rotating membership of the intergovernmental forum -- comprising countries with territory within the Arctic -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States. The body aims to promote cooperation on environmental protection, as well as to help govern oil and mineral exploitation, shipping, tourism and fishing. America's priorities as the incoming chairman of the body ""include addressing the impacts of climate change, Arctic Ocean safety, security and stewardship and improving economic and living conditions for people in the Arctic,"" said acting State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. The meeting comes only months before December's UN climate talks in Paris aimed at drawing up a new international pact to peg global warming to 2C over pre-industrial levels. It comes amid further bad news for the Arctic after US officials last month said the Arctic sea ice had reached its lowest winter point since satellite observations began in the late 1970s. Among major carbon emitters, the United States, the European Union and Russia have already put their positions on the table for the Paris talks, with the US vowing a reduction of 26-28 percent in its emissions of greenhouse gases by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. Rising temperatures have boosted international interest in the polar region, as melting ice opens up shipping routes and makes hitherto inaccessible mineral resources easier to exploit. jkb/pst"
Emerging opportunities in Arctic should be jointly used - Russian diplomat,Iceland,"POLITICS: ARCTIC-MEETING-RUSSIA Emerging opportunities in Arctic should be jointly used - Russian diplomat MOSCOW, April 20. /TASS/. The opportunities that are emerging in the Arctic should be used jointly for the benefit of the whole region, Russia’s ambassador-at-large and senior official at the Arctic Council, Vladimir Barbin, said on Monday. ""All the member-states of the Arctic Council believe that the opportunities opening there need to be used collectively and for the good of the whole region,"" the Russian diplomat said ahead of the ministerial meeting on April 24-25 in Iqaluit, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. The Russian delegation will be led by Natural Resources Minister Sergey Donskoy. ""The framework plan that is due to be adopted at the ministerial meeting in the sphere of preventing oil pollution should be aimed at creating favorable conditions for the development in the Arctic,"" Barbin said, adding that the document focuses on the need to avoid environmental risks. Speaking on rivalry in the Arctic amid the current political environment, Barbin said that of course, everyone has an interest here. ""However, all the controversial issues in the Arctic should be resolved through negotiations,"" he said. Russia is ready to cooperate on all the issues, the diplomat said. In particular, this concerns the economic cooperation and raising the investment attractiveness of the region. All the projects that are being initiated by the Arctic Council, including tourism and personnel training, will be implemented and ""the contribution of observer states will be only welcome,"" he said. The Arctic Council is a high-level intergovernmental forum that consists of eight Arctic states - Denmark, Iceland, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States, Finland and Sweden."
Women’s Enterprise Scotland chief among mentors recognised with Queen’s Awards,Iceland,"WOMEN’S Enterprise Scotland chief executive Margaret Gibson and business angel Nelson Gray have been recognised for their contributions to growing business in the Queen’s Awards for Enterprise. The Scottish pair were among just six recipients from across the UK who received an award for enterprise promotion. Eight Scottish companies, in industries ranging from technology and oil services to tourism and clothing, also picked up prizes for international trade. Mrs Gibson worked with the Prince’s Scottish Youth Business Trust (PSYBT) for 23 years, eventually becoming its deputy chief executive. She moved on to a further enterprise development role as chief executive of Women’s Enterprise Scotland, thought to be the only organisation of its type in Europe. Along with that she is involved in mentoring with the likes of Young Enterprise Scotland and Entrepreneurial Spark. She said: “It is a lovely recognition but I was a bit shocked. When you do a job, you should do it because you love it and get a lot of pleasure out of it. I have done that for over 20 years and I think I am incredibly lucky to have found something that I love doing. “I have worked with some pretty amazing entrepreneurs over the time.” Mrs Gibson highlighted the Celtic rock band Skerryvore as one of businesses which particularly stood out during her career to date as it was very unusual for PSYBT to support a music act. She said: “They are just about to celebrate their 10th anniversary this summer and are having a big festival in Oban this summer. One of my passions is music so when PSYBT supported them it was great.” Mr Gray, who said he was thrilled to receive the award, is a well-known figure on the Scottish business funding scene having been involved with organisations such as East of Scotland Investments, Strathclyde Investment Fund and LINC Scotland. The accountant was one of the founders of the Scottish Institute for Enterprise, set up to encourage students in business, and a member of the worldwide GlobalScot network run by Scottish Development International. Across the UK 105 businesses got awards for international trade, with 24 recognised for innovation and 12 prizes for sustainable development. Of the Scottish winners, raincoat maker Mackintosh was cited for its commitment to keeping manufacturing in the UK which has allowed it to attain an upmarket position in many overseas locations. It was said to have seen “outstanding” export growth over the past three years. Perth-based Air Service Training (Engineering), which provides training and consultancy to the aviation industry, has established facilities in places such as Iceland, Jordan and Indonesia as well as providing workers from around the world with new skills from its home in Scotland. Other winners were oil and gas chemicals supplier Aubin Group, oil services firm Balmoral Comtec, software and electronic testing developer Calnex Solutions, energy industry supplier Global Pipe Components, Motherwell based Consarc Engineering and tourism operator Rabbie’s Trail Burners."
Complete escapism in incredible Iceland,Iceland,"A private helicopter tour to Iceland's rugged interior and exclusive use of a mythical lighthouse make for an exceptional Nordic stopover As my partner and I sat on the black sands of Reynisfjara beach, listening to our guide tell the tale of the Reynisdrangar rocks, a 20-strong Japanese photography group wandered past, taking pictures of the otherworldly basalt rock formations, the oil slick-like pewter sea (and, finally, us) with their telephoto lenses. It was 9pm, and the sun still hung high in the sky, casting a golden haze over everyone. It was a surreal scene. The rock formations, are – the story go­es – trolls who waded out to sea to help a distressed ship, and were turned to stone when struck by the first rays of sunlight at dawn. Legends such as these come up often in Iceland. The Sagas tell tales of not only the trials and tribulations of the first settler families, but also elves, trolls, sorcery and magic. They are bible-like in their relevance, used to explain the country’s dramatic landscapes: like Reynisdrangar, the country’s glaciers, rivers and volcanoes are woven into folklore. It seems fitting, then, that our home for the night was in the fairytale-like Dyrhólaey lighthouse. Dyrhólaey, ""door-hole island"", is so named because of a huge arch of cooled lava which extends into the sea underneath the house. Placed on the edge of a promontory, it’s surrounded by natural assets: the black beach to the east, the Vestmannaeyjar islands to the west and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier in the north. Resident puffins fly around at dusk. It’s the most southern point in Iceland, and for us to be spending the night here is a first. While the lighthouse is still fully functioning, it has never before been inhabited, and certainly not by tourists. For just two months this year, September and October, it is being transformed into a boutique hotel, which will be run by a hotel from the nearby town of Vík. In Iceland to preview what forthcoming guests can expect to experience, our three-day trip began in Reykjavik, where we took flight in a helicopter despite whipping Arctic winds. Up and away we climbed, over the Lego-like houses of the low-rise capital, all primary colours lined in neat rows. Buildings, designed to resemble natural forms, stood out: we saw the stepped frame of Hallgrímskirkja, a jagged, concrete church inspired by lava rock and dystopian in appearance, and the new Harpa concert hall, whose façade is inspired by the crystallised basalt columns found in Iceland. We glided north west, away from civilisation. Rust-coloured lava fields, still dusted with snow in spring, unfurled below us; the all-white outline of Vatnajökull glacier decipherable in the distance. I saw the Iceland of the big (and small) screen through my window, while our pilot told us of the films on which he has worked, flying cameramen around for aerial shots: Game of Thrones, Interstellar, Thor. We landed in a crater, geothermal steam enveloping our chopper, and as we stepped out onto the lunar-like land, the sulphuric smell of bubbling geysers was strong. This was the closest we’d come to the uninhabited planes in the centre of the country, and at that moment, it was hard to comprehend just how isolated we were. The day before, flying from London Gatwick, it was a scene of hyper-civilisation that stood below us. Our subsequent tour by land was similarly spectacular. We spent most of our time on Route 1, the sole ring road that circumnavigates the entire country – though we focused on the Golden Circle roadway, where the country’s moniker ‘land of fire and ice’ is perhaps best illustrated. We entered Thingvellir National Park, known not only for the Althing, where parliamentary sessions were held until 1722, but also as the site of the mid-Atlantic ridge, where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Nowhere does the sense of Iceland’s intrinsically connected history and nature become more apparent than here. From there we veer south, towards the coast, seeing modernist churches, surrounded by nothing but rolling hills; the farm that signalled the alert when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano erupted in 2010; wild horses; black swans; and gushing, gargantuan waterfalls. We gear up and climb into a cave where we’re sprayed with freshwater from Gljúfrabúi, see the frozen tendrils of Seljalandsfoss and tentatively climb up to the top of the rainbow-littered Skogafoss. There is even time in our tight itinerary to visit a family-run thermal spa, whose steam rooms use the vapour from geysers below, and menu offers geothermal baked bread and arctic char fished from its lake. Back at the lighthouse, we climb up to the roof where the all-important lantern is housed, sipping on Birker liquor while we watch the colours of the sunset dance from blue to purple, pink to orange. When the sun finally fades, we retire to our bedroom, the drum of light beating as it spins round and round, alerting ships to their – and our – location. We are like the trolls of Reynisdrangar, out at sea, trying to keep them safe. The Icelandair Incredible Stopover[http://www.icelandair.us/flights/stopover/] will be available from September 1 to November 1, 2015, from €2,785 (£1,980) per person for a group of four people. The package includes one night at the lighthouse, one night at Hotel Reykjavik Marina, activities and flights. As part of the Stopover service, transatlantic passengers can remain in Iceland for up to seven nights at no additional airfare before flying to another destination in Europe or the US."
*S&P; Upgrades Iceland To 'BBB/A-2'; Outlook Stable,Iceland,"17 Jul 2015 11:35 ET Press Release: S&P; Upgrades Iceland To 'BBB/A-2'; Outlook Stable   The following is a press release from Standard & Poor's: OVERVIEW       -- Over the next several months, we expect Iceland to address its sizable balance-of-payments overhang and start to gradually ease the capital controls.      -- In our view, the government's proposed measures will be beneficial for investor sentiment and improve access to foreign capital markets for nonsovereign issuers. They could also yield material one-off fiscal revenues for the government.      -- We are therefore raising our long- and short-term ratings on Iceland to 'BBB/A-2' from 'BBB-/A-3'.      -- The outlook is stable, indicating that the risks to the ratings are balanced, in our view.  RATING ACTION  On July 17, 2015, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised its long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on the Republic of Iceland to 'BBB/A-2' from 'BBB-/A-3'. The outlook is stable.  RATIONALE  The upgrade reflects what we view as credible government proposals that will enable the eventual lifting of capital controls, which have been in place since the 2008 banking crisis. We believe that the proposals will address the country's sizable balance-of-payments vulnerability by relieving the latent pressure on the Icelandic krona (ISK) exchange rate. As a result, we expect that foreign investor sentiment will strengthen and nonsovereign borrowers' access to international capital markets will improve.  We anticipate that the measures will lead to sizable one-off fiscal revenues for the government. Our upgrade is premised on the assumption that any such proceeds will be used to pay down government debt, and therefore not spent in a way that could contribute to economic overheating.  On June 8, 2015, the Icelandic government announced a comprehensive strategy for capital account liberalization. The strategy addresses the three components of the country's sizable balance-of-payments overhang. These are: the local and foreign currency-denominated claims of the banks that defaulted in the crisis (the old bank estates) against Icelandic residents (which amount to 45% of Iceland's 2015 GDP); the krona held by nonresidents (largely attributable to ISK-denominated bonds issued by nonresidents before the crisis, which are known as glacier bonds and equal about 15% of 2015 GDP); and domestic residents' pent-up demand for foreign assets (estimated at about 25% of 2015 GDP by the International Monetary Fund).  Under the proposals, the old bank estates will be taxed at 39% of their total assets unless they sign agreements by year-end on ""composition,"" under which their assets will be liquidated without bankruptcy, and fulfil ""stability conditions."" For their part, the creditors of the old bank estates have presented proposals on how these stability conditions could be fulfilled. The creditor proposals involve a payment by each estate of a so-called stability contribution. This comprises a set of measures, tailored to each estate, broadly aimed at preventing any ISK-denominated assets originating from the sizable claims the estates hold against Icelandic residents from being sold and converted into foreign currency--thus destabilizing the Icelandic krona--over the next several years.  In the coming months, the government will also make an offer to nonresident holders of ISK to either sell their krona at a foreign currency auction (most likely at a discount to the onshore krona exchange rate), to invest their krona in long-term treasury bonds, or to deposit their krona in non-interest-bearing accounts for a number of years.  Not all creditors of the old bank estates have put forward the stability contributions approach. Even so, we expect the claimants to broadly adopt them in order to avoid the payment of the 39% asset tax. However, the risk remains that some creditors could postpone or derail the plan by challenging the government in court, potentially prolonging the capital controls. In our view, there is also a risk that nonresident holders of liquid ISK could undertake litigation.  Our baseline forecast, however, assumes that the proposals will succeed in relieving Iceland's overhang on the foreign exchange market and, consequently, enable the gradual easing of restrictions on cross-border financial flows. We have frequently cited external risks as being a key constraint on the sovereign credit ratings on Iceland. We now see these risks as lower than they were before.  In particular, we believe that as the restrictions on Iceland's capital account are gradually relaxed, nonsovereign Icelandic entities will be able to tap foreign credit markets more readily, thereby relieving potential future pressure from servicing the nonsovereign external debt. The relaxation of capital controls is also likely to result in a gradual reduction of the administrative burden imposed on Icelandic companies with foreign currency revenues, like those in the fishing sector, which are currently obliged to repatriate all their foreign currency earnings. We also believe that foreign direct investors could increase their investments given the prospects for greater macroeconomic stability, although recent foreign direct investment has largely been exempted from the capital controls.  The stability contributions will also likely entail sizable one-off fiscal revenues for the government, albeit less than if the 39% asset tax is imposed across the board. We and other market observers estimate that these receipts could exceed 20% of 2015 GDP if the proposals are adopted. Given that this estimate is subject to significant uncertainty, both in terms of the amount and timing of the receipts, we do not currently include it in our fiscal forecasts.  Even without these one-off gains, Iceland's underlying fiscal position supports the ratings. We expect the general government deficits to average 0.8% of GDP over 2015-2018, significantly less than the 5% of GDP average deficits observed over the last six years. We expect general government debt, net of treasury deposits at the central bank, to decline to below 50% of GDP by 2018. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Iceland has regained capital market access and has issued instruments denominated in both euros and U.S. dollars on multiple occasions.  At the same time, we continue to see a number of risks for Iceland's underlying fiscal position. Spending pressures could emerge if public sector wage hikes exceed our current expectations. The government also incurs moderate contingent liabilities, mostly from government guarantees for the national power company Landsvirkjun and the lossmaking mortgage lender Housing Financing Fund (HFF). The government has had to inject over ISK50 billion (2.5% of 2015 GDP) in capital to HFF over the past several years, and future assistance could exceed current government estimates.  The ratings on Iceland continue to be supported by its generally effective and predictable policymaking. The governing coalition of the center-right Independence Party and the centrist Progressive Party controls a majority in parliament and they agree on key issues. These include opposition to EU membership, promotion of large-scale investments, and the removal of capital controls.  We also expect Iceland's economy to grow robustly over the forecast horizon, averaging close to 3% through 2018. Growth will be primarily supported by private consumption aided by wage increases and household debt relief implemented by the authorities. Perhaps more sustainably, it will also be boosted by large investments in the metals industry, tourism, and fishing. These investments could boost Iceland's export performance by the end of our forecast horizon in 2018. The Icelandic economy also benefits from a well-educated workforce, very high labor participation rates, and favorable demographics.  At the same time, we see considerable risks from this year's private and public sector wage settlements. In our view, national wage hikes could exceed 20% over the next three years. We fear that this could lead to a marked appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the krona, diminishing Iceland's competitiveness and leading to a deteriorating current account position, ultimately complicating the task of liberalizing cross-border financial flows.  These risks are exacerbated by the uncertainties that remain around how this or a future government could use the potential fiscal receipts from the stability contributions. Although it is not our base case, we consider that there is a possibility that they could be used for public expenditures as opposed to debt reduction, thus contributing to the domestic economy overheating.  Iceland is the world's smallest economy with an independent monetary policy. In our assessment, Iceland's monetary policy has historically not been effective at keeping inflation near the central bank target. More recently, inflation has been somewhat contained, mostly reflecting imported deflation owing to lower foreign oil and commodity prices. That said, we have revised our inflation forecasts significantly upward because of the sizable wage hikes we expect over the next three years.  The financial sector has been substantially rehabilitated since the 2008 bank defaults. The new commercial banks are well-capitalized and nonperforming loans have declined significantly over the last few years. (See ""Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment: Iceland,"" Dec. 10, 2014, for more details on the Icelandic banking sector.)  OUTLOOK  The stable outlook reflects our view that the risks to our ratings on Iceland are balanced. We could raise the ratings if Iceland's fiscal position were to improve faster than we currently anticipate or capital controls are lifted sooner than we expect, without putting the krona exchange rate or financial stability at risk.  We could lower the ratings if we perceived that sizable wage hikes pose a  17 Jul 2015 11:36 ET Press Release: S&P; Upgrades Iceland To 'BBB/A-2'; -2- material risk for the country's monetary, fiscal, or external stability. We could also lower the ratings if progress on lifting capital controls is significantly delayed or if it leads to a significant decline in net reserves, placing renewed pressure on the exchange rate or the Icelandic financial system.

At the onset of the committee, the chair confirmed that the information provided to the Rating Committee by the primary analyst had been distributed in a timely manner and was sufficient for Committee members to make an informed decision. After the primary analyst gave opening remarks and explained the recommendation, the Committee discussed key rating factors and critical issues in accordance with the relevant criteria. Qualitative and quantitative risk factors were considered and discussed, looking at track-record and forecasts.  The committee agreed that external assessment had improved. All other key rating factors were unchanged.  The chair ensured every voting member was given the opportunity to articulate his/her opinion. The chair or designee reviewed the draft report to ensure consistency with the Committee decision. The views and the decision of the rating committee are summarized in the above rationale and outlook. The weighting of all rating factors is described in the methodology used in this rating action (see 'Related Criteria and Research').

Climate change crusade goes local,Iceland,"Florida's state leaders are running hard from climate change. The governor, Rick Scott, doesn't want state employees to even utter the words. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and US Sen. Marco Rubio, both Republican presidential aspirants, offer a medley of objections to scientists' calls for bold action on climate change. Eric Carpenter shrugs. The director of Miami Beach's Public Works Department sits at his desk, poring over tables of high tides on his computer. He is calculating how many pumps he needs to buy to keep the city's streets from being flooded from a rising sea caused by climate change. Under a broiling sun, he takes a visitor a few blocks from his office, to where contractors are pouring concrete to replace a section of a city street. The new roadway is being laid incongruously 2-1/2 feet above the sidewalk cafe tables and storefront entrances at the old street level. The extra height is in preparation for the seas and tides that Mr. Carpenter already sees engulfing this section of Miami Beach. ""The facts are the facts, and we have to deal with them,"" he says. In city after city in South Florida, local officials are dealing with climate change. So, too, are municipalities big and small across the United States. The same determination is evident among governors and legislators in more than two dozen states. And it is magnified worldwide: Surprising progress in grappling with global warming is coming from surprising nations. This groundswell of action on climate change is producing solutions and often bypassing lagging political leadership. The gathering force of these acts, significant and subtle, is transforming what once seemed a hopeless situation into one in which success can at least be imagined. The initiatives are not enough to halt the world's plunge toward more global warming - yet. But they do point toward a turning point in greenhouse gas emissions, and ambitious - if still uneven - efforts to adapt to the changes already in motion. ""The troops on the ground, the local officials and stakeholders, are acting, even in the face of a total lack of support on the top level,"" says Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pa. ""The impacts of climate change are pretty bad and projected to get much worse if we continue business as usual. But there still is time to avert what we might reasonably describe as a true catastrophe. There are some signs we are starting to turn the corner."" Philip Levine, the mayor of Miami Beach, agrees. ""We may not have all the answers,"" he says. ""But we're going to show that Miami Beach is not going to sit back and go underwater."" - - - Representatives from more than 190 countries will gather in Paris in December to try to agree on international strategies for dealing with climate change. They will be spurred by their own alarm at a succession of storms, droughts, and heat waves affecting millions of people on the planet, and by outside calls, such as the moral edict from Pope Francis, to care more about the world. The record of past such meetings is not encouraging. But the representatives will arrive as progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, often overlooked, has been mounting: - Wind and solar power generation are bounding ahead faster than the most optimistic predictions, with a fivefold increase worldwide since 2004. More than 1 in 5 buildings in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and even Albania are now powered by renewable energy. - The US saw its greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2007. They have fallen about 10 percent since, and are roughly on course to meet President Obama's pledge to reduce emissions in the next 10 years by about 27 percent from their peak. - China, the world's largest carbon emitter, paradoxically leads the world in installed wind and solar power, and is charging ahead on renewables. China and the US ended their impasse over who is most responsible to fix global warming, agreeing in November to mutually ambitious goals. Experts say China already has cut coal consumption by 8 percent this year, and the environmental group Greenpeace says China stopped construction of some new coal power plants. - Worldwide, carbon dioxide emissions, a principal component of greenhouse gases, did not grow in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. Emissions remained flat even as the global economy grew - an important milestone. - Coal-fired power plants are being replaced rapidly by natural gas plants, which are cleaner and emit half the greenhouse gases. Britain saw an 8 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, which is attributed to national energy policies, more energy efficiency, and the switch from coal. - Tropical rainforests, which absorb carbon dioxide, are being cut down at a slower rate than in the past - 13 million hectares per year, compared with 16 million in the 1990s, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. That is still alarmingly high but shows progress, in part because of vows by big corporations not to buy palm oil grown on deforested lands. Brazil has made notable progress in reducing deforestation of the Amazon. In the US, state and local governments are taking bold action even as the national discussion about the looming climate crisis remains paralyzed along political lines. In South Florida, for example, officials of four populous counties shun the rhetoric from GOP presidential aspirants and officials in the state capital and gather regularly to plot cooperative climate change strategy. That group, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, is considered a national model for the kind of shoulder-to- shoulder effort needed to address the problem. They came up with an agreed estimate of sea level rise and identified the most vulnerable areas of the region, and now are plowing through more than 100 recommendations for action. ""There are no new funding sources coming down from the state or the Feds,"" says Susanne Torriente, assistant city manager for Fort Lauderdale, one of the participants of the compact. ""Would it be good to have state and federal dollars? Yes. Are we going to wait until they act? No."" Their cooperation was born, essentially, on the back of a napkin. Kristin Jacobs, now a state representative who was a Broward County commissioner in 2008, was lamenting at the time that the 27 disparate municipal water authorities in the region could not agree on joint action. So she and others came up with the idea of getting local officials together in a classroom. ""We said, 'Let's have an academy,' "" she recalls, and the Broward Leaders Water Academy began offering elected officials in South Florida six-month courses in water hydraulics and policy. It has now graduated ""three generations of elected officials,"" she says. Figuring out what to do about climate change - whether it is building up dunes on the beaches, raising the height of foundations, or shifting developments back from the coastline - takes a cooperative approach. ""We couldn't do it by just saying 'this is the way it is' - the Moses approach,"" Ms. Jacobs says. ""We had to do it with compliance and acquiescence and leadership."" Normally, direction on some of these issues might have come from state officials. But not in Florida. Not on climate change. ""We didn't have to worry about those who don't believe,"" Jacobs says. ""At the end of the day, when the water is overtopping your sea wall, you don't really care that you didn't believe in climate change last week. You do believe in it this week."" - - - Built on the edge of the sea, Miami Beach is one of the most vulnerable cities in the world to the vicissitudes of the ocean. Its boutique commercial district and canyons of pastel apartments sit on a sieve of porous limestone. The leaky footing was formed over the eons from accumulated seashells, coral, and fish skeletons. Today the rock acts as a giant wick, giving the relentless ocean a route for subterranean attack. Seawater pushes in from underground and often gurgles to the surface in inconvenient places. On days of really high tides - even without any rain - the briny invasion turns some city streets into small lakes, snarling traffic and cutting off businesses. Locals call it ""sunny day flooding."" The man charged with stopping the sea - or at least getting tourists and residents out of its way - is Carpenter, an affable engineer with a burly physique. Carpenter took over the city's Public Works Department two years ago. His recurring nightmare is of rising seas, frequent storms, and ""king"" tides sweeping through Miami Beach - and doing it in full view of the world. He knows that whatever the city does - or does not do - to prepare for climate change will be tested soon on a stage before a global audience. ""What we do here is magnified because of who we are,"" he says. Miami Beach thrives on a global reputation for glamour, for cultural fusion, for beaches, for heat - from the sun in the day and its epicurean club culture at night. That's not an image that sits well with flooded streets. But the water is already coming. As the Atlantic Ocean warms and expands, fed by melting polar ice caps, the seawater is pushing back into the 330 storm-water pipe outlets designed to drain rain from city streets. So Miami Beach is in the process of installing as many as 80 pumps, at a cost of nearly $400 million, to make sure the water flows outward. ""If the seas are continuing to rise, and the tidal events are higher than the inland elevation, we have to pump,"" says Carpenter. The city plans to raise the level of 30 percent of its streets, encouraging businesses to abandon or remodel their first floors to go to a higher level. Carpenter says he wanted to go up nearly six feet, but town officials said ""we are going too fast."" So they settled on just over three feet. ""I don't think this is where we want to be long-term, but it's enough to get us through the next 10 or 20 years,"" he says, while standing on a new section of road at Sunset Harbor, looking down at the cafe tables on the sidewalk below, where the street used to be. Mayor Levine echoes the importance of dealing with the future encroachment of the sea - now. ""We did not ask for climate change or sea level rise,"" he says. ""But we are the tip of the spear. We don't debate the reason why; we just come up with solutions."" Forty miles to the north, past Fort Lauderdale, Randy Brown and his utilities staff in Pompano Beach are also trying to halt the sea. Like the rest of South Florida, the coastal city of 100,000 residents is confronting the ocean above and below ground. They are burying a new network of water pipes - painted grape purple - running to businesses and homes. The pipes contain sewer water that has been treated to remove the smell and bacteria and then siphoned from a pipe that used to discharge it into the sea. Pompano Beach residents use the water for their lawns and gardens, bypassing the restrictive bans on lawn sprinkling. This recycled water then trickles down into the Biscayne Aquifer. Cleansed as it sifts through the ground, it helps reduce the shrinking of the freshwater aquifer, which is being drawn down by the town's 26 wells and is threatened by underground salt water pushed inland by the rising sea level. Homeowners pay about two- thirds less for the recycled water than they do for potable water. When city officials first laid out the program at a public meeting, bringing a cake to set a neighborly tone, ""it was a fiasco. [Residents] called it dangerous,"" chuckles Maria Loucraft, a utilities manager. Now, people ""say they can't wait for it to get to their area,"" adds Isabella Slagle, who goes to public events with a mascot, a purple-colored sprinkler head with sunglasses, named ""Squirt"" by elementary school students. Green lawns trump the political arguments over climate change, says Mr. Brown. ""We don't say 'climate change,' "" he admits. ""It's 'protecting resources' or 'sustainability.' That way, you can duck under the political radar."" Some don't want to avoid the radar. Last October, the South Miami City Commission voted to create ""South Florida"" and secede from the rest of the state, in part because, they said, the state government in Tallahassee was not responding to their pleas to help them deal with climate change. ""It got a lot of press but nobody in the state took it very seriously,"" muses the mayor, Philip Stoddard, over a sandwich on the campus of Florida International University, where he is a biology professor. ""But it did get people talking about climate change."" ""My house is at 10 feet elevation,"" he adds. ""My wife and I - our question is - will we be able to live out our lives in our house? I'm 58. We don't know. It's going to be a close one. If you look at the official sea level projections, they keep going up, which is a little disquieting. If you look at the unofficial projections, they scare the hell out of you."" While South Florida is a leader at local cooperation, officials in towns and cities across the country are struggling to react to a warming climate. Many municipalities have drafted action plans. Boston is converting its taxis to hybrids and requires new buildings to be built with higher foundations. Chicago is planting green gardens on city roofs to reduce the air conditioning needed to cool buildings. Seattle is helping residents install solar panels. Montpelier, Vt., vows to eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2030. Houston is laying down ""cool pavements"" made of reflective and porous material, and planting trees for shade. Governors and state legislators across the country have gotten the message, too. While Congress will not debate the ""Big Fix"" - putting a price or a cap on carbon pollution - some states are already doing it. About 30 percent of Americans live in states that have rules capping carbon dioxide emissions and markets that allow companies to buy and sell carbon credits. In addition, 28 states have set mandatory quotas for renewable energy from their electric utilities. Seven states have set ambitious targets for overall greenhouse gas reductions - California has promised a reduction of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. ""The best thing Congress can do right now is stay out of the way,"" says Anna Aurilio, director of the Washington office of the nonprofit advocacy group Environment America. Between the state efforts and the executive orders by Mr. Obama, she says, the US is on track to meet the administration's greenhouse gas goals. ""When we look at programs currently in place or set to be implemented, we can come close to the US commitment"" of a 27 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 10 years, she says. ""But we know we have to go much, much further."" To get near the goal of keeping average global warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or less, climatologists predict that countries must largely abandon the fossil fuels that have driven technological societies since the Industrial Age - achieving an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That is an imposing goal, since billions of dollars are invested in new and existing fossil fuel power plants that can last 30 to 50 years. Even if solar or wind energy is cheaper than coal, oil, and natural gas, the owners of fossil fuel plants will be reluctant to abandon their investments. But the decisions are starting to come from the people, not just governments or corporations. ""When you have enough action taking place at the grass roots, sometimes that's a more effective means of implementing change on a large scale,"" says Penn State's Mr. Mann. - - - Nicole Hammer is one of the foot soldiers in the new war on global warming. A biologist, consultant, and former assistant director of a university center on climate change, she quit and decided to work with nonprofit groups, including the Moms Clean Air Force, an organization that campaigns to stem air pollution and climate change. ""I realized we have more than enough science to take action on climate change,"" she says while walking at an ecology park near her home in Vero Beach, Fla. ""People who normally wouldn't be involved in environmental issues are starting to speak out."" She believes community involvement is the key to solutions, because the problems are felt most keenly at that level. ""We have people in communities who have to put their kids in shopping carts to get across flooded streets to get food,"" she says. ""When you see that happening - and then you see people at high levels denying it - it's disappointing and it's incredibly frustrating."" Public outcry has helped close coal-burning power plants, which produce the dirtiest energy. Coal plants now provide about one- third of the electricity in the US - down from more than half in 1990. Tightening pollution standards and cheaper natural gas prices have prompted utilities to close 200 coal-fired plants since 2010, the Sierra Club estimates, and the trend would only accelerate under new clean air regulations unveiled by Obama in early August. Until recently, one argument against closing coal plants was that if the US didn't burn its own abundant coal reserves, they would just be exported to China. But Chinese authorities are so sobered by their public's resentment of the thick coal soot and industrial pollution that they are turning with startling speed to renewables. China reached a significant agreement with the US in November to cap its greenhouse gas pollutions by 2030, and further impressed experts in July by promising to ramp up renewables to provide 20 percent of its power, a sharp turn away from its pace of bringing a new coal power plant on line every 10 days. ""China has become a policy innovator,"" says Nathaniel Keohane, vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, who worked on international climate issues in the Obama administration. Other countries are plotting their own ways to curb greenhouse gases. Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain are ramping up solar energy. France has embraced nuclear. Denmark, Portugal, and Nicaragua led in wind power in 2014. Brazil is adding hydroelectric plants as well as sharply reducing deforestation. Kenya and Turkey are tapping geothermal power. And smaller countries such as Costa Rica, Iceland, and Paraguay have found financial and tourism benefits in being at or very near ""carbon neutral."" Still, the current projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on when the world will see a significant decline in global emissions vary widely - from about 2030 to after 2100 - based on guesses of how countries respond. But the dramatic shift to natural gas in the US, and the racehorse expansion of hydraulic fracturing to get it, are demonstrations that if new technologies are profitable, industries can pivot quickly. ""We can make that turn,"" Mr. Keohane predicts. ""Imagine the day when emissions are falling instead of rising. Imagine when we are winning rather than losing."" While US leaders remain bogged down in debate over global warming, local communities are acting on their own to hold back rising seas. Witness Miami Beach's elevated streets."
See the light in the land of fire and ice,Iceland,"A helicopter tour and exclusive use of a lighthouse make for an exceptional stopover in Iceland, says Jade Conroy As my partner and I sit on the black sands of Reynisfjara beach, listening to our guide tell the tale of the Reynisdrangar rocks, a 20-strong Japanese photography group wander past, taking pictures of the other-worldly basalt rock formations, the oil slick-like pewter sea (and, finally, us) with their telephoto lenses. It is 9pm, and the sun still hangs high, casting a golden haze over everyone. It is a surreal scene. The rock formations, are - the story goes - trolls who waded out to sea to help a distressed ship, and were turned to stone when struck by dawn's first rays. Legends such as these come up often in Iceland. The sagas tell tales of not only the trials of the first settler families, but also elves, trolls and sorcery. They are used to explain the dramatic landscapes: Reynisdrangar, glaciers, rivers and volcanoes are woven into folklore. It seems fitting, then, that our home for the night is in a fairytale-like lighthouse on Dyrhólaey: ""door-hole island"" is actually a promontory named after a huge arch of cooled lava which extends into the sea. It is surrounded by natural assets: the black beach to the east, the Vestmannaeyjar islands to the west and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier in the north. Resident puffins fly around at dusk. It's the most southern point in Iceland, and for us to be spending the night here is a first. The lighthouse is still functioning, but it has never before been inhabited, and certainly not by tourists. For just two months this year, September and October, it will be transformed into a boutique hotel. In Iceland to preview what guests can expect, our three-day trip began in Reykjavik, where we took a flight in a helicopter despite whipping Arctic winds. We climbed, over the Lego-like houses of the low-rise capital. Buildings, designed to resemble natural forms, stood out: we saw the stepped frame of Hallgrímskirkja, a jagged, concrete church inspired by lava rock and dystopian in appearance, and the new Harpa concert hall, whose façade is inspired by crystallised basalt columns. We headed north west, away from civilisation. Rustcoloured lava fields, still dusted with spring snow, unfurled below us; the allwhite outline of Vatnajökull glacier recognisable in the distance. We landed in a crater, enveloped by geothermal steam and the sulphuric smell of geysers. Our subsequent land tour was similarly spectacular. Spending most time on Route 1, the ring road that circumnavigates the entire country - we focused on the Golden Circle roadway, where the country's moniker ""land of fire and ice"" is perhaps best illustrated. We entered Thingvellir National Park, known for the Althing, where parliamentary sessions were held until 1722, but also as the site of the mid-Atlantic ridge, where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Nowhere does the sense of Iceland's intrinsically connected history and nature become more apparent than here. From there we veered south, towards the coast, passing the farm that alerted the world to Eyjafjallajökull volcano's eruption in 2010; wild horses; black swans and gargantuan waterfalls. Geared up, we climbed into a cave to be sprayed with freshwater from Gljúfrabúi, saw the frozen tendrils of Seljalandsfoss and climbed to the top of the Skógafoss. There was even time to visit a thermal spa, with geyser-fuelled steam rooms and a menu offering geothermal baked bread and arctic char. Back at the lighthouse, we climb to sit with the lantern, sipping Birkir liquor and watching the colours of the sunset. When the sun finally fades, we retire to bed, the drum of light beating as it spins, alerting ships to their - and our - location. We are like the Reynisdrangar trolls, trying to keep them safe.

Nature's last refuge: climate change threatens our most fragile ecosystem,Iceland,"An Arctic voyage through the awe-inspiring Northwest Passage shows that, with oil drilling in the far north on the way, rapid action is needed to protect the region The Northwest Passage is not an obvious choice for a holiday cruise. It is, after all, one of the most notorious ocean routes. Many hundreds of sailors died in opening up the seaway, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via the Canadian Arctic, before it was conquered just over a century ago. But the Arctic today is changing. Global warming is altering it at a rate that is unmatched anywhere else on Earth, and a journey once considered grotesquely dangerous has become a voyage now feasible for the inquiring traveller. Today you can sail through the Northwest Passage, as I did last week, on a ship that offers hot-tubs, bars and restaurants, albeit with armed protection against polar bears and kit for keeping out the cold. Related: Journey through the Northwest Passage – in pictures[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/aug/30/journey-through-the-northwest-passage-in-pictures] By contrast, in 1845 John Franklin’s expedition to find the Northwest Passage was utterly defeated by the Arctic, even though his ships, the Erebus and Terror, were equipped with steam-powered engines, tinned food and other wonders of 19th-century technology. Trapped in the ice for several years, all 129 men on board died, many resorting to cannibalism as the end neared. But 170 years on, ships have strengthened hulls, global positioning receivers, radar and powerful engines. Hence the ease with which our liner – the Akademik Sergey Vavilov research vessel, operated by One Ocean Expeditions[http://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/] – made its 12-day, 1,945-nautical-mile journey from Kangerlussuaq in Western Greenland, across Baffin Bay, on to desolate Beechey Island (where some of Franklin’s men are buried), down through the Bellot Strait and past King William Island – near where the wreck of the Erebus was discovered last year – and into the little port of Cambridge Bay. Most of the voyage was made on seas generally free of ice and which were as calm as mill ponds, revealing some of the world’s most bleakly beautiful landscapes: mist-shrouded cliffs, ice floes that stretch to the horizon, and aboriginal settlements, some of them thousands of years old. However, there is another factor that made this journey possible, one that reveals the darker side of humanity’s scientific might and which provides the most intriguing aspect of any Arctic visit. Every year our factories and cars pump billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and emissions continue to rise remorselessly. As a result, our planet is heating at a worrying rate, with the Arctic bearing the brunt of temperature rises[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/17/antarctica-sea-ice-record-high-arctic-sixth-lowest-extent]. Every year the melting of sea ice in the far north starts earlier and earlier and it is now vanishing at a rate of about 13% per decade. As a result, the Arctic’s sea ice cap has shrunk by nearly a third since 1979, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre[http://nsidc.org/]. Finding enough ice in which to get trapped is becoming the Arctic’s real problem. That erosion of ice is likely only to worsen, scientists warn. Ice reflects radiation. But if it disappears, and reveals below it the Arctic’s dark waters, which are much better than ice at absorbing heat, less and less solar radiation will be reflected back into space and the Arctic will warm up even more. Indeed, many scientists now believe the Arctic could be free of sea ice in summer within a few decades. It is difficult to assess what will be the consequences. Most experts believe they will be profoundly damaging. As Eric Solomon, director of Arctic programmes for the Vancouver Aquarium, puts it: “Sea ice is the foundation for life here.” In removing that foundation, humanity is carrying out a highly dangerous experiment – on a colossal scale. Consider the simple issue of algae. It grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals. Take away the bottom rung of this food chain and all sorts of unintended consequences could be realised. Then there are the narwhals. These tusked whales – sometimes called the unicorns of the sea – are prized by Inuits who use their blubber and skin to make a traditional, extraordinarily chewy meal called muktuk. (It’s an acquired taste, I discovered.) Narwhals can hide, safely, in sea ice and so avoid their natural predator, the killer whale. Robbed of that protection, narwhal numbers could dwindle dangerously, marine biologists warn. Polar bears are also likely to suffer. These creatures are magnificent hunters. They can smell their favourite prey, ringed seals, from more than a kilometre, even though the seals may be hiding under snow. It is thought there are about 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic, made up of separate populations in 20 different regions. Unfortunately there have been few long-term studies of Ursus maritimus and half of these different populations are simply rated as being in an uncertain status. However, in well-studied populations, such as those around the town of Churchill, on the Hudson Bay, research indicates that the body sizes of polar bears – and their birthrates – are declining as the climate warms. “This does not bode well,” says Canadian naturalist Franco Mariotti. Then there is the impact on humans. For Inuits, sea ice not only helps protect the local food chain, it acts as a highway on which they can ride their skiddoos and dog sleds to hunt and to visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of local communities and limits the ability of people to hunt. This problem is only likely to get worse as the region is opened for mining and oil drilling. This month Barack Obama gave final approval for Shell to drill into potential oil reserves beneath the sea floor of the Arctic Ocean[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/shell-gets-final-clearance-to-begin-drilling-for-oil-in-the-arctic]. The move was denounced as “potentially catastrophic” by Greenpeace, while Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, a US environmental organisation, said the decision “goes against science, the will of the people and common sense”. Concerns have been raised over Shell’s ability to clean up a spill, should one occur, in an area covered by sea ice for much of the year. If one considers the example of the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico,[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/02/bp-will-pay-largest-environmental-fine-in-us-history-for-gulf-oil-spill] it took 87 days to cap, even though it happened in a fairly accessible region. In the Arctic, which is virtually impenetrable in winter, a similar gusher would be far more difficult to tackle. More to the point, the region’s ecology is about the most fragile on the planet and would be far more vulnerable to the impact of a major spill. Take the landscape on the south shore of Devon Island. At 74° north, it is swept by ferocious, freezing gales which, in winter, send temperatures plunging to minus 50C. The island has a polar desert climate with hardly any precipitation. Yet life clings to this bleak wilderness. My walk there a few days ago revealed an astonishing array of plants hugging the ground to survive: willows, which grow as trees in the UK but which, up here, shrink up to the size of twigs to keep out of the gales. In addition, the Arctic campion, or lantern flower, provides unique protection for its seeds, housed in a minuscule globe that acts like a greenhouse. These adaptations are vivid illustrations of life’s extraordinary resilience, though they would be quite incapable of withstanding any major environmental disaster. Related: Can Shell afford Arctic oil? | Karl Mathiesen[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/can-shell-afford-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic] Across Lancaster Sound, the lowering cliffs of Prince Leopold Island provide another demonstration of the vulnerability of the region’s wildlife. The steep cliffs of this Unesco world heritage site provide refuge for thousands of black-legged kittiwakes, fulmars, black guillemots and thick-billed murre, creating a vast, mist-shrouded citadel of screaming, winged wildlife. The island is one of the world’s most important refuges for migratory birds and again is highly vulnerable, as so many other areas of the Arctic, to ecological mishap. It is not just the risk that oil drilling poses to the Arctic that causes consternation, however. It is the extraordinary notion that it is a good idea to take advantage of a problem that has been caused by our over-dependence on fossil fuels – by drilling for even more fossil fuel. Hence Friends of the Earth’s furious denunciation of the decision to let the Arctic’s pristine Chukchi Sea[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/can-shell-afford-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic] “become an energy sacrifice zone [that will only] worsen climate disruption”. The real problem that faces the Arctic is its uncertain political status, a point that is clearly demonstrated by comparing the region with its southerly counterpart, the Antarctic. The latter is controlled by the Antarctic Treaty, which bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military. It also strictly controls all environmental hazards. By contrast, the Arctic is owned by a ragbag of nations – Russia, Canada, the US, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark (through its dependency, Greenland) – which have very different ideas about how to run the place and which have shown no inclination to outlaw mining or oil drilling or impose cast-iron environmental controls. Apart from the environmental risks that they pose, increasing mining and drilling operations will have many other consequences. Ships will end up crisscrossing the region for increasing numbers of days. The Inuits’ icy highways will be broken up even more while the region’s bowhead, blue and beluga whales face the prospect of their underwater communications being disrupted or blocked in these once quiet waters. Rubbish is also a problem. In Antarctica, every piece of waste is removed from the continent. In the Arctic, no such rule is invoked, as is demonstrated by the container vessels of washing machines and other household goods that arrive in summer as the ice melts and ports like Kangerlussuaq and Sisimuit in Greenland and Port Inlet in Canada open up. These once-a-year imports, booked online months in advance, provide local householders with the means to modernise their homes. Crucially, the containers that brought them return empty. No attempt is made to ship away the old household goods that have been replaced. They are simply left to rust in the air. In short, what arrives in the north, stays in the north: a small but significant demonstration of the casual indifference that is adopted when dealing with environmental issues in the region. The Arctic remains a place of extraordinary beauty that is inhabited by some of the planet’s most remarkable animals. But time is running out. The region needs protection on the scale that has been meted out to the Antarctic, an idea recently backed by a House of Lords report on the Arctic[http://www.parliament.uk/arcticcom]. As peers remarked, current approaches to protecting the Arctic are far too hesitant and cautious. In this, they are almost certainly correct. Whether we have time to bring meaningful improvements is a different matter. Change is sweeping the far north. Time is not on its side. Pressure points Global warming is bringing major changes. Mining The Arctic contains large quantities of iron ore, copper and nickel and new mines are being planned and constructed to exploit these, raising worries about pollution. Proposals to drill for oil have also triggered concerns about threats to the region’s delicate ecology. Tourism Cruise expeditions into the Arctic are expected to expand significantly, bringing in more and more tourists while placing strain on the environment and the region’s few, small towns. Politics Control of the region and its transport routes is hotly disputed by the eight Arctic nations. Canada, for example, claims the North west Passage as national sovereign waters. The US says it is an international waterway."
"New England's ports, long past their prime, seek comeback with niches in global trade",Iceland,"NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ The noise and bustle of nearby neighbourhoods fade away at New Haven's sprawling port. An oil and chemical tanker floats placidly at a dock. A tug pushes a barge out in Long Island Sound. Only occasionally do trucks rumble up to a scrap metal business or deliver materials for road work. What was a key port for lumber and other goods dating to Colonial times is, like other New England ports, facing a reckoning after a lengthy decline. In the region that nurtured the beginnings of New World commerce with whaling, fishing and shipbuilding, state and local governments are taking stock of aging infrastructure at deep-water ports. As they move to stake out their share of global trade, the challenge is how to stay relevant in an age of ever-larger ships. ""There are so few people who know about our deep-water ports,'' said Judith Scheiffele, executive director of the New Haven Port Authority. ""I think it's kind of taken for granted.'' New England's ports saw their national rankings in terms of total trade plummet since the 1970s, a trend that only accelerated with the Great Recession. New Haven, which ranked 33rd in the nation in 1972 with 13.1 million tons, ranked 57th in 2013 with only 8.4 million tons, according to the American Association of Port Authorities. The drop owes to issues of access and global forces far outside local control. Ports constantly need costly dredging, and the will has not always kept up with the need to remove silt. In Bridgeport, Connecticut, New England's southernmost port, ship traffic is severely limited because the harbour has not been dredged since 1964, leaving it short of the standard 35-foot depth in places. A harbour's depth is key to attracting business and has huge significance for marketing, said Tim Sullivan, deputy commissioner at the state's Department of Economic and Community Development. Money that once might have gone toward deepening harbours and providing rail and highway connections was used to increase security after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to John Martin, a maritime industry analyst. Boston is having its harbour deepened to 51 feet at the entrance and 47 feet in inner channels and will be the region's only port accommodating bigger ships, said Edward O'Donnell, chief of the navigation section at the Army Corps of Engineers in New England. With the exception of Boston and Portland, New England's ports generally handle only cargo that is loaded individually _ not the large, more lucrative container shipping. More commerce is moving on giant ships that can pass through an expanded Panama Canal. New England's location, on the East Coast, doesn't help, either, as lately it is Asia _ and not Europe _ that sends most cargo by sea to the United States. A number of governments are puzzling over how to take better advantage of the economic potential at their deep-water ports. In Connecticut, a state port authority was created to promote three major ports on Long Island Sound: Bridgeport, New Haven and New London. The goal is to attract investment by marketing them as alternatives to the Northeast's traffic-clogged highways. The state has not made an estimate of how many jobs might be created, an economic development spokesman said. New Haven is planning a study on whether to dredge down to as much as 42 feet instead of the current 35 feet. Farther north, the Maine and New Hampshire departments of transportation made it a high priority to create space to accommodate larger ships at the Port of New Hampshire, whatever future vessels might be carrying, when they selected a design for a $173 million upgrade to the bridge over the Piscataqua River separating the two states. Sixteen companies that use the river and harbour employ nearly 1,000 workers, and the bridge upgrade is seen as preserving those jobs, said Geno Marconi, director of the New Hampshire Port Authority. Many shipping lines, seeking to maximize profit, invested millions adding large freighters carrying truck-size containers. To capitalize on the investment, ships must deliver at ports that can accommodate their size. Those ports are typically outside New England. But some in New England see opportunities to capture some of the spillover. ""The much bigger ships from Asia are not likely coming to Connecticut,'' said Sullivan, of the Connecticut economic development department. ""They'll displace smaller ships from larger ports. Those ships are going to need some place to go.'' Bridgeport can be a ""great secondary market'' after the New York-New Jersey port 60 miles away, said Andrew Nunn, the city's chief administrative officer. Ports also have been seeking out tourists and niches in global trade. Tourism, embraced by many port cities as commerce began to decline in the early 20th century, has been stressed in deals with cruise ships to promote the cities' maritime history and culture. And at the Port of Davisville in Rhode Island, about 18,000 cars a month roll off ships, including nearly 850 Bentleys last year. Wind turbine equipment goes to Searsport, Maine, to supply the state's alternative energy products. Some in the region, like New Hampshire, receive road salt and heating oil, staples for New England winters. Some smaller ports export recyclables such as scrap metals. And from Portland, electric cars are shipped to Iceland, where they are in high demand because plentiful geothermal energy makes them inexpensive to operate. ""We're never going to be Long Beach or Baltimore or Boston,'' said Bill Needelman, waterfront co-ordinator for Portland. ""We're a niche port that provides services for particular markets and products.'' Associated Press writer Michael Sirolly in Philadelphia contributed to this report."

(The amount of currency NBU bought on interbank market has been updated) KIYV. Sept 18 (Interfax-Ukraine) – The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) plans to start holding auctions to buy foreign currency in the amount of up to $10 million a day from banks, the NBU said on its website. ""The sum of currency which the NBU will buy would be up to $10 million a day. In other words, the regulator could buy, for example, $5 million or $7 million depending on the sum that bidders would offer at the acceptable price,"" director of the open markets department at the NBU Serhiy Ponomarenko said. Every bank will be able to participate in the auctions. They will be able to submit several bids at various exchange rates, which the NBU could satisfy, starting from the lowest exchange rate to sell foreign currency. The regulator has the right to declare the auction a failure if the bankers present unacceptable offers. The regulator can buy foreign currency without a negative impact on the hryvnia exchange rate due to the stabilization of the currency market and the expected large inflow of currency from sales of the new harvest. Details on the auctions will be published separately before each auction. The NBU said that since early 2015, the central bank bought $1.5 billion on the interbank currency market. KYIV. Sept 18 (Interfax-Ukraine) – The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) in resolution No. 612 of September 17 decided to place public joint-stock company Bank Finance and Credit, which is under control of MP Kostiantyn Zhevaho, in the category of insolvent banks, the central bank said on its website. ""Bank Finance and Credit took liabilities to support the bank's liquidity thanks to sale of non-profile assets of the shareholder and observe the level of mandatory reserves and other requirements… When the shareholder did not fulfill its liabilities, we reacted quickly. Today, the bank was declared insolvent and transferred to the fund [the Individuals' Deposit Guarantee Fund],"" reads the report, citing NBU Governor Valeriya Gontareva. NBU said that 93.2% (234,000 people) of all depositors in the bank would receive their deposits in full, as their deposits do not exceed the sum guaranteed by the Deposit Guarantee Fund of UAH 200,000. Gontareva said that NBU had been working on the financial readjustment program both with top managers of the bank and its majority shareholder – Zhevaho. She said that the bank had problems for seven months, and during the whole period the shareholder observed all the recommendations of the NBU. However, these measures was not enough, and the shareholder failed to fulfill its written liabilities to support liquidity and requirements in the agreed terms, in particular, for reserves, regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity, the regulator said. ""When it was time to pay debts and sell assets, the shareholder did not do this in the proposed term. I want to say that this bank is not systemic, and placing it to the category of insolvent banks brings no threat to stability of the country's banking sector,"" Gontareva said. She said that a lion's share of the bank's assets was linked to crediting of business of the majority shareholder. Bank Finance and Credit was founded in 1990. The ultimate beneficiary of the bank is Ukrainian businessman and MP Kostiantyn Zhevaho, a majority shareholder and CEO in Ferrexpo, a major iron ore pellet producer and exporter. Bank Finance and Credit ranked 10th among 127 operating banks in the country as of July 1, 2015, in terms of total assets worth UAH 38.882, according to the National Bank of Ukraine . Its liabilities to individuals as of July 1, 2015 totaled UAH 16.98 billion, including UAH 11.61 billion pegged to foreign currency. KYIV. Sept 18 (Interfax-Ukraine) – The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has decided to place public joint-stock company Bank National Investment to the category of insolvent banks, according to NBU board's resolution No. 613 of September 17. The regulator said that the non-transparency of several transactions of the bank and the quick reduction of liquidity at the bank were first the reason of placing the bank to the category of troubled banks and introducing a curator to the bank. NBU had to declare Bank National Investment insolvent when facts of non-reflecting documents of clients which were not settled in the term set in Ukraine law in the bank's accounting documents were established. ""NBU monitors transactions of banks with non-transparent structure of ownership. In addition, the Individuals' Deposit Guarantee Fund could declare bank's transactions void if it is proved that they entailed worsening of the financial state of the bank or resulted in its insolvency,"" NBU said. Bank National Investment was founded in 1995. The bank ranked 34th among 127 operating banks in the country as of July 1, 2015, in terms of total assets worth UAH 4.248, according to the National Bank of Ukraine . Its liabilities to individuals as of July 1, 2015 totaled UAH 1.83 billion, including UAH 1.204 billion in foreign currency. KAZAN. Sept 18 (Interfax) - Ukrainian sanctions against some Russian banks will not undermine the stability of the Russian banking system, Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina told journalists on the sidelines of the Finnopolis Kazan Forum of Innovative Financial Technologies. ""This decision, of course, is not enough to undermine the stability of the banking system,"" Nabiullina said. The individual economic sanctions imposed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Wednesday affect 29 Russian banks, including Bank of Moscow, which has a wholly owned subsidiary, BM Bank (Kyiv), in Ukraine, as well as Gazprombank , a lender to major Ukrainian companies. They will be hit by two types of sanctions - freezing of assets and suspension of the fulfillment of economic and financial obligations. The former means that the banks right to use and control their assets will be temporarily restricted, and the latter means that they will be barred from extending credit, loans, financial assistance and guarantees, providing credit through purchase of securities and buying securities. It was reported earlier that Gazprombank has extended loans to Naftogaz Ukrainy and the nitrogen enterprises of Dmytro Firtash's Ostchem that have not been repaid yet. KYIV. Sept 18 (Interfax-Ukraine) – Ukrainian insurance companies collected net premiums worth UAH 10.831 billion in H1 2015, which is 24.2% less year-over-year, according to the Web site of the National Commission for the Financial Services Markets Regulation of Ukraine. According to the regulator, the number of gross insurance premiums collected by the insurers in January-June 2014 amounted to UAH 13.465 billion, which is 22% more year-over-year. The financial markets watchdog has noted that the increase of gross premiums was thanks to an increase of 2.5 times in freight and baggage insurance, a rise of 22.7% in car insurance (voluntary car insurance or KASKO, mandatory insurance of motor vehicles owners' civil liability or OSAGO and Green Card insurance), a rise of 21.8% in property insurance, a rise of 51.7% in financial risk insurance and a rise of 2.3 times in aviation insurance. Collection of premiums fell in accident insurance (by 51.8%), life insurance (by 3.8%), fire and disaster insurance (by 5.9%) and credit insurance (by 23.1%). The net premiums' share of gross premiums in H1 2015 was 80.4%. In H1 2015, insurers paid UAH 2.985 billion in net insurance claims, which is 26.7% up year-over-year. The level of net payments in claims grew to 27.6% from 27%. The gross insurance payments in claims grew in all key types of insurance: life insurance by 3.2 times, car insurance by 12.8%, financial risk insurance by 3,219% and property insurance – by 2.3 times. Payments in claims on fire and disaster risk insurance fell by 49.7% and credit insurance – by 6%. The commission said that gross payments in H1 2015 grew by 27.4%, to UAH 3.055 billion. The level of gross payments in claims grew to 22.7% from 21.7%. The level of gross and net payments in claims in medical insurance was 59.9% and 61.5% respectively, voluntary personal insurance – 45.4% and 48.1%, life insurance – 30%, OSAGO – 33.1% and 33.2%. The regulator said that over the period insurance reserves grew by 17.7%, to UAH 16.247 billion. With a decline of total assets of insurance by 3.9%, assets defined in Ukrainian law as those to provide funds for insurance reserves grew by 2.5%. Paid charter capitals fell by 2.4%. The commission said that in H1 2015 the number of insurance agreements (apart from obligatory traffic accident insurance agreements) grew by 2.9 times, to 50.316 million, including a rise of 3.2 times in the number of agreements signed with individuals, to 48.936 million.

Russia Ready for Development of Joint Economic Projects in Arctic - Lavrov,Iceland,"MOSCOW, January 25 (Sputnik) - Russia is open to the joint implementation of large-scale projects in the Arctic region in accordance with strict environmental safety standards, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. ""We are open to joint implementation of large-scale projects in the region, including in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. This refers, in particular, to the development of oil and gas fields, the use of the Northern Sea Route as the shortest cargo transit route between Europe and Asia, and the development of industrial, transport and tourist infrastructure,"" Lavrov said in his article for the Shared Voices magazine on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Arctic Council. He pointed out that the economic development of the Arctic region must be pursued in compliance with the highest environmental standards, as well as with due respect for the people living in the region and their traditional lifestyles. The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the governments of the Arctic countries. The forum comprises eight Arctic nations, namely Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. In 2013, Moscow announced a strategy to bolster its presence in the Arctic and boost the region's development by 2020.  "
My secret hideaway: foreign correspondents reveal all,Iceland,"Foreign correspondents know how to get under the skin of a country. But where do they go when they want to get away from it all? Here, well-travelled journalists reveal their ultimate holiday escapes Afua Hirsch on São Tomé e Principe, Africa At first I felt critical of the many Africans I spoke to who had never heard of São Tomé e Principe[http://www.theguardian.com/travel/sao-tome-and-principe]. It is after all an African country, albeit one of the smallest (population 194,000) and remotest – an archipelago of tiny islands nestled in the watery armpit of west and central Africa, deep in the Atlantic, with Gabon to the east and Nigeria to the north. Then I realised how difficult it was to get there. Back then, in 2002, there was one flight a week from Gabon, and one from Lisbon which ferried the children of Portuguese aristocrats to secretive resorts in pristine bays at the foot of volcanos carpeted in the country’s endless virgin rainforest. I had graduated from university just months before and in my shiny new NGO job chose São Tomé as the location for an international conference I was organising. But getting hundreds of dignitaries there meant chartering planes, training hotel staff and even having new phone cables laid. I arrived exhausted. My VIP guests were in a strop, not because the plane I’d chartered looked ripe for the scrap heap, but because it had no business class seats. I was not in the mood to fall in love. But I did. I’d never seen volcanoes so alive with forest or the Atlantic such a seductive, sleepy blue. I’ve never felt so close to a history I thought much older – no African language is spoken in São Tomé, but, rather a creole version of Portuguese. The inhabitants are all descended from slaves, Portuguese outcasts and Jewish children dumped on the islands hundreds of years ago. People lived in the ruins of decayed colonial palaces as if the plantation had collapsed the day before. It felt separated at birth from another part of the world – the Caribbean or South America – with its palatial palms and crumbling façades, ridgeback mountains and Portuguese towns. But it’s Africa all right. Billions of barrels of oil have achieved what natural beauty and human charm never did and placed it firmly on the map. The oil workers have been streaming in since São Tomé and I had our first encounter: I hope people seeking Africa’s greatest beauty will, too. Fly to São Tomé e Principe from London via Lisbon with TAP Portugal from £457 ( flytap.com[http://flytap.com] ). Stay at Omali Lodge, doubles from £106 ( omalilodge.com[http://omalilodge.com] ) Afua Hirsch is the former West Africa correspondent for the Guardian Lyse Doucet on New Brunswick, Canada I’ve heard it time and time again. New Brunswick? “Oh, I drove through it to get to Nova Scotia.” Acadians? “Hmm…” Cajuns? “Oh… Cajun cooking… Music… Louisiana!” But New Brunswick in eastern Canada is much more than a place to drive through. And its northeastern coast will not just delight but enlighten you about a people who survived a British colonial expulsion from here in 1755 and returned to establish a vibrant culture and proud sense of self. The Acadians are the descendants of the French who colonised the region from the 17th century, and if you visit on 15 August, Acadian national day, you’ll be loudly reminded of that by the tintamarre. At 17.55, on the dot, people dance in the streets, beating pans and blowing horns, to make as much noise as possible to let the world know they’re still here. A dark day in imperial history, when thousands were forced to flee south – including to Louisiana, where the term Acadian became “Cajun” – is now a vibrant celebration of survival. A drive along the winding shore takes you through a picturesque landscape of simple cottages hugging the coastline and rambling farmhouses set back on rolling green fields (except in the freezing depths of winter, when all is snowy white). Lobster traps and the Acadian flag are ubiquitous – a tricolour to honour French ancestry, with a bright yellow star, representing the Stella Maris, the star of the sea, that guides sailors in storms. To know even more about this charming corner on the sea, visit the Acadian village, a functioning replica of life through the late 18th to the mid-20th centuries. Inside the original wooden houses of the first Acadian families they are carrying on with daily chores, but are never too busy to warmly welcome visitors. History comes alive in the evening at the elegant L’Hôtel Chteau Albert[http://www.villagehistoriqueacadien.com/en/hotel-chateau-albert], where you can tuck into an old- fashioned meal while being entertained by a trio of traditional fiddlers. On my last visit there, a female fiddler recounted how she had to practise in secret as a young girl. Fiddling was only for men then. And do drop by the Doucet farm in the historical village, where you may find them baking bread.

Stay at L’Hôtel Chteau Albert, doubles from £70 ( villagehistoriqueacadien.com[http://villagehistoriqueacadien.com] ) Lyse Doucet is the BBC’s chief international correspondent Ed Vulliamy on Sfntu Gheorghe, Romania The Sfntu Gheorghe arm of the Danube Delta is gratifyingly hard to reach: by ferry from the river port of Mahmudia, which departs between two and five hours late, laden with essential goods that folk in Sfntu Gheorghe on the Black Sea shore cannot buy in their village shop. The boat navigates bends in Europe’s mightiest river, past oxbow lakes and through newly dug channels. A small crowd makes its way through the mud to the jetty with donkeys to collect the shopping. There are two cars in Sfntu Gheorghe: one belongs to the policeman, the other to the government environmental officer. During my first visit in 1995, they had crashed and were being repaired. I frequent Sfntu Gheorghe thanks to an ornithologist friend from Bucharest. His metier – along with caviar from local sturgeon – is the ostensible reason to be there: a wonder of eagles, egrets, vultures, cranes, ibises, cormorants and pelicans. Fishermen weigh their wares on iron scales in a market that has not changed for centuries. They say that when the sea howls it means a life lost in revenge for man’s abuse of the oceans. Sure enough, last time it howled, the bodies of a father and son washed ashore. I was supposed to catch the dawn boat, but the captain was dancing on the table, drinking vodka One day the ornithologist took me out on the river in his little boat. And there it was: the howl, a heart-stopping scream, and the river heaved. The ornithologist’s jovial face was suddenly terrified and intense as he gripped the outboard motor to carve a way through the current and driving rain. After 50 minutes of thinking that any of them could be my last, we made it to the bank. On the night they return, the fishermen gather, after a brief visit home, at the only bar in town: a window cut into a brickwork house. Outside which they sit to drink vodka that comes in bottles the size of a standard beer – that’s the unit per round, and I confess it’s tough going. In keeping with the vulgarisation – and invasion by tourism – of anything authentic in Romania (as everywhere else), there is now a Green Village Resort in Sfntu Gheorghe: some people on TripAdvisor seem to have had horrendous experiences there, which can only be a good thing. On one final night in Sfntu Gheorghe, the ornithologist and I were supposed to have gone to bed early, to catch the dawn boat back to Mahmudia, but the captain was dancing on the table, drinking vodka, so there didn’t seem to be much hurry. When the ferry did leave, I was as ever sad to leave with it, into the quickening eastern sky and the brave dawn of newly capitalist, tourist-friendly Romania. Fly to Bucharest from London with Ryanair from £22.99 (  ryanair.com [http://ryanair.com] ). Mahmudia port is roughly four hours’ drive, then take the ferry to Sfntu Gheorghe. Stay at the Green Village, doubles from £40 (  greenvillage.ro [http://greenvillage.ro] ) Ed Vulliamy is a writer for the Guardian and Observer and was was New York correspondent for the Observer and Rome correspondent for the Guardian Kate Connolly on Hiddensee, Germany As a hideaway it could hardly be better named. The island of Hiddensee[http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/11/10-best-european-islands-holidays-greece-italy-france-spain] sits on Germany’s north-eastern tip and is one of the country’s sunniest, windiest locations. Despite being just under 11 miles long and, at its broadest point, only two miles wide, even in the height of summer it is surprisingly easy to find a spot in the dunes or in its expansive heathland to escape the daytrippers who arrive en masse from neighbouring Rügen. While to English ears at least its name sounds like a clever reference to its remoteness, it is in fact a nod to the legendary Norwegian king, Hedin, who is believed to have fought here. Whether for a love interest or for gold, opinions are divided, but in any case Hedin’s Oe – or Hedin’s Island as it was named while under Danish rule – has more or less stuck. In the 1920s the Baltic island was a magnet for intellects and artists. The families of writers Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Günter Grass (whose wife was a Hiddenseer), sculptor Käthe Kollwitz and the Freuds were among the regulars, as was Danish film star Asta Nielsen[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003425/], who had a playful circular holiday home, the karusel. The Freud connection endures to this day thanks to Esther Freud’s 2003 novel The Sea House[http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview13], which recalls the holidays her great-grandfather Sigmund and his family enjoyed on the island before they and many Hiddensee residents were banned by the Nazis. The family found some sort of solace in the village of Walberswick on the Suffolk coast which, with its grassy sand dunes, large skies and a home they called “Hidden House”, reminded them of the beloved Baltic island they were forced to forsake. I’ve been coming here regularly for more than a decade, and it has never lost its appeal as an ideal place for escape. It is car-free, with no golf courses and, at around six hours by train and ferry from Berlin, close enough for a long weekend. Aside from swimming, walking and biking, there are three bookshops, a theatre, some pubs and a tent cinema. Otherwise there’s little more to do than ask locals to teach you how to fish for pieces of amber after a storm, or literally “milk” the bright-orange buckthorn berries for their vitamin C-rich juice. It continues to be a draw for writers and artists, too. Lutz Seiler’s 2014 novel Kruso, which won the German Book Prize (out in English this year), is set in Hiddensee during the heady days before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It’s a poetic tribute to the island as well as offering an insight into life here during the East German dictatorship for those wanting to flee to the west (Denmark is hardly more than an energetic swim away) as well as those who simply sought internal exile amid the wind and the waves from the every day strains of the GDR. Hiddensee has never lost its appeal as an ideal place for escape. Fly to Berlin from London with EasyJet from £29.49 (  easyjet.com [http://easyjet.com] ).

Ancient limestone terraces descend towards Battir and the cool valley of Wadi Refaim, with its fig trees and gazelles. Small apricot orchards hem in the old stone farms that dot the slopes. Just outside the town is where you find Hosh Jasmin[http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/mar/14/middle-east-holidays-countryside], an organic farm and restaurant opened in 2012 by filmmaker, sculptor and restaurateur Mazen Saadeh. Fifteen minutes’ drive from the western edge of Jerusalem, Hosh Jasmin is both circumscribed by – and defies – Israel’s continuing occupation of the West Bank. Located in Area C, under Israeli security and administrative control, it is reached – for us at least – through the Walajah checkpoint, passing the Israeli settlement of Har Gilo. The Israeli separation wall is visible from Hosh Jasmin in the distance, a snaking line of grey concrete. Despite the reminders, it is a place to escape for a while from the continuing violence and tensions, popular with Palestinians from the neighbouring town, Jerusalemites and internationals. Visiting on a “blue moon” last year, a group of musicians had been assembled. The waiters, encouraging us to stay, suggested if everyone was drunk enough a midnight walk would be initiated. Named for the Syrian-style hosh compounds, tables are set on rough-hewn wooden platforms under the trees, areas designed for sprawling on cushions, although there is a small indoor area for when it rains and a fire pit for the winter chill of the Jerusalem hills. Elsewhere there are hammocks and swing seats. Below is Saadeh’s farm, including olives that Hosh Jasmin presses for oil, fruit trees, hives and rabbit runs and the restaurant’s arak distillery. Its location is a double-edged sword. The lack of building permits for Palestinians in Area C has preserved the area’s rustic feel, and it also means that the accommodation Saadeh provides for those who stay beyond when the fire burns down is a treehouse and several tents. This Christmas those of us in the press corps celebrated lunch outdoors with turkey and Palestinian starters and Taybeh, the Palestinian beer. On other days the food is dictated by the seasons, although there are no actual menus. Specialities include rabbit zarb, a tagine-like dish cooked in an underground oven, Palestinian dumplings and chicken musakhan with flatbread in its rich sauce of onions and sumac served on a flat bread. For me, the best time is the late afternoon and evening, watching the hills bruise purple into night as the fire starts. Then, Hosh Jasmin is a place to forget – for a while at least – all of the area’s troubles. Fly to Tel Aviv from London with British Airways from £304 return (  ba.com [http://ba.com] ). Eat and camp at Hosh Jasmin organic farm (  facebook.com/HoshJas [https://www.facebook.com/HoshJas] ; +972(0)599 868 914), which can be reached from Jerusalem by taxi or hire car (  europcar.co.uk [http://europcar.co.uk] ). You will need your passport to cross the Walajah checkpoint Peter Beaumont is the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison on the Jalori Pass, India The sound of cymbals, drums and song followed us the whole morning, across hillsides of wild iris and through deodar forests, the musicians hidden and the music sometimes thinning to silence but always returning again when mountain paths brought us and the mysterious band back within earshot. We met them at last outside a tea shack on the Jalori Pass, more than 3,000m high, villagers escorting a goddess swathed in gold and scarlet to the Dussehra festival in Kullu town, two days’ walk away. She would be jostled and photographed there by thousands of tourists, but we met her almost alone, our paths crossing at just the right moment. We asked one man why he had turned down the chance of a lucrative city life. ‘I missed these mountains,’ he said It seemed like serendipity but our guide, Prem Singh Bodh, had known more or less when the group would arrive, after decades hiking trails in this corner of north India. Friends got to know him while living in Delhi, and had invited me to join them on a 10-day trip to an area that is little visited by tourists, but full of life and natural beauty. We met pilgrims at ruined hilltop forts that have become windswept temples. Kids raced up to one campsite from the nearest village and convinced us to lose a game of cricket on an impossible slope. Their teacher was a postgraduate with a taste for Victorian literature – “Thackeray, Kipling, Dickens” – who grew up the other side of a nearby peak. We asked why he turned down the chance of a more lucrative city life after graduating. “I missed these mountains,” he said simply. Between those meetings, we had the forests, fields and temples to ourselves for hours at a time. We slept in tents on high meadows beside a woodland lake and spent a couple of nights in spartan but charming lodges built for colonial administrators more than a century ago. We were camping, but it felt luxurious, with air mattresses, ponies to carry gear so we travelled with just a small day pack, and even a cook. A few bars of coverage would occasionally appear on the phones of people trying to keep in touch with home. But most of us were happy to be out of contact and suspended in time. It was often surprising, always beautiful and entirely special, and because we arranged the trip directly with Bodh’s company, Zingaro, it was a relatively affordable £50 per person per day – including tents and lodges, food and guides. We spent nothing else because there was nothing we needed and nothing to buy. Zingaro also arranges trips to higher altitude areas, for those seeking an even more remote getaway. Fly to Dharamsala (aka Kangra or Gaggal) from London via Delhi with Air India from £495 (  airindia.in [http://airindia.in] ). Zingaro treks can organise treks across northern India (  zingarotreks.com [http://zingarotreks.com] ). Ask Zingaro for advice, but they will usually meet you with a 4x4 or minibus at the edge of the mountains Emma Graham-Harrison is international affairs correspondent for the Guardian and Observer and was Afghanistan bureau chief for Thomson Reuters Matilda Temperley on Kaokoland, Namibia Five hundred miles north-east of Windhoek, the dusty town of Opuwo is nestled into the edge of Kaokoland’s arid hills. The local inhabitants are bare-breasted, clad in goatskin and covered in ochre. These are the Himba. They live alongside Herero women wearing dresses reminiscent of 19th-century German colonialists with hats shaped to resemble cow horns. Unusual characters arrive in this small trading hub to replenish their supplies at the area’s only garage and supermarket before disappearing back into the surrounding desert. Opuwo is the entrance to the remarkable Kaokoland that lies to the east. This is an area so empty and vast you can drive for days without seeing another soul. I picked up a local guide in Opuwo and set off in the 4x4 (complete with camping gear and roof tents) I had rented in Windhoek. Within an hour, a sandy riverbed stalled our progress and throughout the day the roads became ever more dubious. It doesn’t take long until you are obliged to stop being precious about your vehicle and surrender to the inevitable punctures, scrapes and scratches and the hundreds of kilometres of unknown terrain that stretch before you. As you drive, red rocks give way to white deserts, plains become mountains and colours evolve with the day. The fact that I was childless at 33 never failed to cause mirth among the villagers After two days of driving, we came across the first sign of human habitation and were surprised to see a rusty petrol drum on a rocky outcrop with signs advertising cold drinks and fuel. It turned out the attendant Himba women had nothing to sell and were rather hoping we could give them some food. It was undoubtedly the oddest petrol station I’ve ever seen. The occasional villages we then passed were welcoming, perhaps because the Himba’s ancestral land rights and autonomy are well recognised and the increasing cultural tourism in the area is largely on their terms. When I visited last February, the villages were mainly populated with women and children as the men were with the herds looking for pasture. The villages were full of laughter, most of which was at my expense. The fact that I was childless at 33 never failed to cause mirth. In the first village I camped in, I was given a live chicken that they insisted I leave with. At the next village, I was made to dance out stories. There was something magical in being innocently teased in this matriarchal society. Kaokoland stretches for many hundreds of kilometres from the Hoanib river north to the Kunene river, which is the border with Angola, and one of the least-populated places on earth. In Kaokoland, you cannot fail to marvel at your insignificance. Kaokoland stole my heart on my first foray and I have been looking for an excuse to return ever since.

A 4x4 with full camping equipment is available from £45 a day Matilda Temperley is a photographer and writer Helena Smith on Koufonisia, Greece Greece has always been about the light. The shadows lie in its luminosity. For years I have tried to swim into the sun, a day’s fading rays made sweeter still by water’s brush. The quest for light can take you places that you might otherwise never know; beaches you might never see. In the summer of 1984, on a whim propelled by adventure, I holidayed on Naxos, crossed it by bike and got into a little cargo ship that took me to a place that at the time seemed so ethereal, so elemental, so remote, it has remained with me ever since. That place was Koufonisia, an isle made up of parts – upper Koufonisi and lower Koufonisi – and over the course of a spring and summer I would come to know both. Before the internet, before mass travel, before Greeks got fat on EU funds, upper Koufonisi had a smattering of white, flat-roofed houses, one fish tavern, one meat tavern, one tourist (a French painter), one road and a girdle of virgin beaches, ornamented by turquoise sea. In the spring its was carpeted with poppies – just as Naxos to its west and Amorgos to its east; and in summer covered by herbs carried on a breeze. But although perfect, it was to be trumped by the discovery of lower Koufonisi: uninhabited (bar the odd shepherd), with even bluer seas, better shorelines and a pure light that began at the end of the cave I swam into with the passing of each day. Several years later I returned to upper Koufonisi, this time making my home a rented villa looking out to sea on the isle’s southern extremity. The water was aquamarine, as seductively translucent as it had been all those summers ago, but it was a world away – a world discovered by Greeks who had built second homes, Italians who went for the tourist season and beach bars that served cocktails to the dulcet tones of Icelandic composers. Lower Koufonisi had changed, too: its cave no more (thanks to a landslide), its beaches the preserve of the droves who descended from fishing boats now busily crossing the 200m channel that separated the isle from upper Koufonisi. But the light was still there, the sky and sea co-joined by a brilliance that was unbeatable and blue. And, as I had done all those years before, I swam into the sun at the end of the day, backstroking through the flat blue, eyes fixed on the brilliant skies and the rocks they framed, knowing I had arrived where I had begun, in the magic of Greece.

Travellers passing through Athens can also book tickets through Grecian travel (  grecian.gr [http://grecian.gr] ) Helena Smith is the Guardian’s correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus Stephen Gibbs on Playa Bacunayagua, Cuba “Go to that bar that serves the piña coladas, cross the bridge, then the road to Bacunayagua is on the left.” Those were typical driving directions in Cuba in the early 2000s. Then, it was a country without road signs. The reason was never clear. One theory was that every time a sign was put up it was stolen so that its metal could be turned into car parts. Another was that Fidel Castro, determined that the nation remain on a constant military footing, was convinced that road signage would help invaders. It made travelling a challenge. And arriving especially rewarding. The directions were good enough the first time I went to Bacunayagua in 2005. There were three of us: two Cuban friends, one of whom was a scuba dive instructor, and me. The piña colada stop was memorable. Alongside the road Marco, in a crisp white guayabera shirt, prepared cocktails for thirsty motorists from palm-fresh coconuts, cream and pineapple. He agreed, reluctantly, to go easy on the rum. After that we crossed the spectacular Puente de Bacunayagua, the tallest bridge in Cuba, completed in 1959. A couple of kilometres later, almost hidden by trees, there on the left was an unmarked, steep concrete road. It dived through a forest towards the sea, bringing us to a complex of run-down 1970s bungalows. In front was the clearest water, framed by an elegant peninsula, and a perfect little hidden beach. This particular stretch of coastline was also a notorious pick-up point for the cigarette boats that come from Florida and smuggle Cubans back to the US. A few bored young soldiers were there on watch; they were surprised to see us. The offer of a cold drink turned their frowns into smiles. They kept an eye on the car while we explored the pristine waters below. I returned to Bacunayagua a few weeks ago. A gleaming blue sign now clearly marks that turnoff to the bay. It is as beautiful as ever, but a little noisier. A Cuban family, complete with relatives from Miami, had rented the house the military once occupied. Silence has been replaced by reggaeton. On the way back to Havana, I stopped at the roadside bar. Marco was still there. “Estás perdido,” he said to me. That delightful Cuban greeting perhaps best translated as: “Where have you been?”, offered with equal feeling whether someone hasn’t been seen for a few days or a few years.

FROZEN FOOD,Iceland,"Everybody knows about Iceland's stunning, Tolkien-esque scenery, the northern lights and the natural geothermal pools. Our restaurant critic Steve Dinneen goes in search of the other Icelandic wonder: food. Egill Skallagrímsson, one of Iceland's most beloved folk heroes, wrote his first poem aged three, was an alcoholic by six and a murderer at seven. He's famed for his acerbic wit, vicious temper and handiness with an axe, which he was more than willing to drive through the skull of friend or foe alike. His tales of conquest, revenge and merriment play out against a backdrop of epic banquets and drinking, both of which he excelled at. Throughout its history, food and booze have been an integral part of Iceland's culture. And little wonder: it can be a singularly unforgiving place during the winter, when its miles of razor-sharp volcanic rocks are blanketed in snow and the only green visible is the flashing of the northern lights overhead. There are countless stories mythologising the scarcity of food, such as the elven ""hid-woman"", a magical creature whose cave you can spot on the road to the breathtaking Snaefellsnes peninsula, far from the tourist trail on the west side of the island. She led a happy existence catching fish in the lake outside her cave until some settlers arrived. The unusually accommodating elf - a tall, gaunt thing with elongated features - grudgingly shared its fishing spot with the settlers, until they decided she was catching too many and murdered her. From that day until this, no fish have been able to survive in the lake. Stories like this are myriad; every precariously placed stone and oddly-shapen hill represents a troll who stayed out after dawn, or some other unfortunate creature. Snaefellsnes itself is a Tolkien-esque wonderland of naturally carved archways and terrifying sinkholes, with strange hexagonal rocks rising from the sea that seem to hint at intelligent design rather than natural formation (they're made when basalt lava is cooled very quickly by cold water). These rocks provide inspiration for Reykjavik's expressionist Hallgrímskirkja cathedral, an austere, grey masterpiece that rises phallically in the centre of Reykjavik. Iceland feels more connected to its folklore than anywhere I've visited; its geothermal landscape, pocked with naturally heated pools and gigantic, spraying geysers, still seems like the stuff of legend even when you understand the science behind them; early settlers must have felt like Prospero washing ashore on his magical island. After a day hiking across this rugged, haunting landscape, nothing is more welcome than a banquet fit Skallagrímsson himself. And Reykjavik is more than able to deliver. For an island with a population of just 323,000, it has an incredibly well-developed restaurant scene, filled with interesting twists on classic Scandinavian cooking. What better way to explore this hearty, unusual cuisine than through a series of epic tasting menus? I embarked on three gigantic meals in three nights. See the details overleaf. MATUR OG DRYKKUR MATUROGDRYKKUR.IS You may be aware, in a theoretical sense, of how big a cod can grow. But you'll never really grasp this until you've been served a head the size of a roast turkey, it's skin crisp and bronzed, jaws slightly open, hollow eyes regarding you as you tuck into the copious white flesh. When you arrive at Matur og Drykkur, a relatively new restaurant located near the harbour, you may question whether you're at the right place. You have to enter through the neighbouring Saga Museum, but don't be deterred: this is a boundlessly interesting restaurant. The food is unapologetically, in-your-face Nordic, with fermented shark and sheep's head common fixtures on the constantly changing menu. The dining room has the woody, spartan quality that you associate with Scandinavian restaurants, combined with the hipper elements from a gentrified Hackney boozer. Decorative touches, such as the paintings of landscapes adorning the walls that have been chopped into slices and mismatched, stay on the right side of quirky. The six-course tasting menu starts with charred flatbread with arctic char (similar to salmon) and horseradish, presented as four minimalist islands on a vast plate: clean, crisp, unfussy. Paper-thin slices of dried fish with whey butter and dulse was a nice twist on bread and butter (and my god, that butter), while cod's liver on crackers was demolished so quickly I can only assume I enjoyed them. Langoustine tail followed, presented in an abstract swirl of dill oil and dulse, a little heap of dried fish shavings grated on top. But the highlight was the cod's head cooked in chicken stock and served with with potato salad and lovage; a meal you won't forget in a while. Dessert of skyr, blueberries and oats was mercifully light. GRILLMARKAÐURINN GRILLMARKADURINN.IS Grillmarkadurinn - translated as Grill Market - is one of Iceland's undisputed heavyweight restaurants. While the exterior is relatively modest, inside is a richly textured grotto, every surface made up of elements representing Iceland's natural heritage. Banquettes are divided by walls of loosely hewn rock, entire walls are covered in mossy greenery and tables are made from thick cross-sections of logs. It's not hyperbolic to say it's one of the most fabulous dining rooms I've ever seen. The tasting menu, which seems to consist of approximately 10,000 courses, is eclectic, darting from pungent deep-fried dried fish to mini lobster burgers with Sichuan mayonnaise. Monkfish skewers with cottage cheese and a tangy, barbecue-style sauce was a highlight, while a bowl of mussels in vegetable broth was a nice change of pace, giving you time to recoup before the hearty chicory-smoked monkfish, salmon with apple and broccoli teriyaki, and cod with chorizo and cauliflower puree. Everything is magnificently well prepared. As you may have gathered, the food draws on disparate, far-flung influences, but manages to maintain its core Nordic identity. Prices in Iceland are rarely cheap, and you'll pay handsomely for the pleasure of dining at Grillmarkadurinn, but with food this good it's hard to argue. APOTEK APOTEKRESTAURANT.IS Of the three restaurants reviewed here, Apotek is the most self-consciously international. Perhaps it's because it doubles as a hotel, but neither the decor - involving lots of medicine bottles - nor the menu give you many clues that you're in Iceland. It is, however, popular with locals, with a bouncy, after-work atmosphere. It's the kind of place I can imagine a survivor of the Icelandic banking crash bringing a date. The six-course fish tasting menu started off with small plates of seared tuna drizzled in spicy aji amarillo (a cheese-based sauce that hails from Peru), perch served amid a vivid explosion of beetroot and dill oil and - the pick of the bunch - curls of cured trout with samphire, quinoa and just a hint of truffle oil. Next up was a decent fillet of cod served with kale and cabbage, which was followed up with another fillet, this time salmon in a sticky barbecue sauce, which seemed like overkill. Given my time again, I'd use Apotek as a place to knock back a few cocktails before returning to Matur og Drykkur to tackle another of those cod heads. It's not bad, but neither is it somewhere you'll be recommending to the folks back home. To put a positive spin on it: it's a testament to the quality of the food in Reykjavik that somewhere this competent can be so comprehensively overshadowed."
INTERNATIONAL TOURIST ARRIVALS TO EUROPE INCREASED BY 5% IN 2015,Iceland,"BRUSSELS, February 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- According to latest European Travel Commission[http://www.etc-corporate.org/]'s ""European Tourism 2015 - Trends & Prospects[http://www.etc-corporate.org/reports/european-tourism-2015-trends-and-prospects-(q4-2015)]"", 2015 marked the 6th consecutive year of above-average growth for the most visited region in the world. This positive performance is attributed to the on-going economic recovery of the Eurozone, the decrease in oil prices and favourable exchange rates that make the region a more affordable option for visitors from overseas. Growth spread across the majority of European countries, buoyed by Iceland (+30%), Romania (+17%) and Slovakia (+16%). Montenegro (+15.5%) and Ireland (+14%) recorded a substantial increase fuelled by the strong demand from key European source markets. Portugal, Croatia (both +10%) and Greece (+8%) also enjoyed sustained growth. Croatia, particularly, benefited from their on-going efforts to extend the pre- and post-summer period, while Greece owes its performance to improving flight connections and to the flow of tourists avoiding competing destinations perceived at risk of terrorist attacks. ""Travel to Europe continues to surge amidst a migration crisis, and safety and security concerns. Prospects for 2016 remain optimistic with growth expected to increase by 3%,"" said Eduardo Santander, Executive Director of ETC.   Exceptions to the overall trend were Bulgaria, Turkey (both -1%), Estonia (-3%) and Finland (-5%) which all saw a decline from the previous year attributable to the fall in arrivals from Russia. Montenegro was the only European destination that enjoyed growth from the Russian market (+6.4% overnights). Key intra-European and long-haul markets to fuel a steadily strong performance  Travel demand from key intra-European markets continues to thrive within Europe despite presage of tighter border controls within the Schengen area. Growth from UK and Germany is in line with positive economic trends whereas increased demand from France and Italy is resulting from the strong appetite for traditional summer destinations.   In the US, the upswing of the economy, a strong US Dollar, and the ever-growing consumer confidence contribute to the appeal of Europe as a holiday destination. The United States[i] accounts for 5% of total arrivals (25.7million) to Europe with further growth expected (+6% annual average) towards 2020. The majority of European destinations also reported growth, +30% Chinese arrivals to Europe, what suggests that the economic slowdown in China failed to deter tourists' enthusiasm to travel internationally.

How to find the best travel deals in 2016; 10 money-saving tips from the pros,Iceland,"10 money-saving tips from the pros 10 money-saving tips from the pros If you’d like to take a vacation (or two or three) in 2016 and save money doing it, you’ll want to hear what I heard AT the annual New York Times Travel Show. Experts providing their best, timeliest advice: Arthur and Pauline Frommer, the father and daughter who publish the famed Frommer travel guides and run Frommers.com; Matthew Kepnes (Nomadicmatt.com), author of “How to Travel the World on $50 a Day;[http://www.nomadicmatt.com/how-to-travel-the-world-3/]” Chris McGinnis of Travelskills.com and the former travel correspondent for CNN Headline News; John “Johnny Jet” DiScala of JohnnyJet.com and Lisa Iannucci, aka The Virgin Traveler[http://www.thevirgintraveler.com/], who targets older people with little experience traveling. Why travel may cost you less Thanks to the sharp drop in the price of oil and the strong dollar, you may pay less to travel than a year ago just by flying abroad. Arthur Frommer noted the very low crude oil prices. One likely effect, he said: “Airlines will be totally unable to increase the cost of their tickets this coming year. And if there is enough public protest, they may even be required to reduce the price of tickets,” since fuel is their biggest expense. And the dollar, Frommer said, has been “reaching heights we haven’t seen in many, many years,” also making foreign jaunts more of a bargain. One general money-saving tip from his daughter, Pauline: Take a tour. “If you want an inexpensive vacation, tours are really suffering,” she said. “River cruises have become so extraordinarily popular; people who used to go on guided motor coach tours now go on river cruises instead through the heart of countries.” And if you haven’t traveled in a while — or ever — “start small,” said Iannucci. “If that means driving four hours to someplace new, do that and then explore the area.” With that overview, here’s how to save the most when taking a vacation in 2016: Where the deals are Japan and Canada are particular values in 2016. Arthur Frommer said, “Japan was once ultra expensive. Now it’s moderately priced for American tourists,” he said. Similarly, he added, “Canada now costs 40% less than as recently as a year ago.” He’s particularly fond of Lake Louise (in the Canadian Rockies, near Banff), “one of the most beautiful sights on earth.” How to save on airfare Check out the huge savings with budget carriers like Norwegian Air[https://www.norwegian.com/us/] and WOW Air. Norwegian Air, the third largest low-cost carrier in Europe, is on a tear to attract U.S. fliers. “It’s making Scandinavia supercheap,” said McGinnis. Norwegian leaves from cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale and flies throughout Europe as well as — get this — to some Caribbean spots. Pauline Frommer mentioned that Norwegian recently introduced $99 fares each way from New York City to Guadeloupe. Norwegian Air is forcing some U.S. airlines to slash their international fares, too. “I bought an American one-way fare for $1 plus tax [$324 in taxes] from Los Angeles to Copenhagen last summer due to its competition with Norwegian,” said Johnny Jet. “I think it’ll happen again this year.” Iceland’s WOW Air[http://wowair.us/] recently offered one-way fares between Boston and Paris for $99. It also flies from Washington, D.C. and plans to start up in Los Angeles and San Francisco this summer. Other budget carriers include AirAsia, Tiger Air, Ryan Air and Jet Blue.(JBLU, US) “You don’t get perks; it’s basically a seat in the sky,” said Kepnes. Be flexible. “Changing your schedule by a day or airport location can save you hundreds of dollars,” said Kepnes. Pauline Frommer, citing a recent Airline Reporting Corporation survey, said passengers found 19% savings, on average, by booking on Sundays. “Not Tuesdays, which is what they found two years ago when they did this study; maybe the airlines wised up,” she added. Don’t lock yourself into flying late morning or early afternoon, either. Johnny Jet recommends looking for flights between 5 and 7 a.m. or after 8 p.m., when fares are often lower. If you can, fly (and stay in hotels) during the “dead weeks,” said McGinnis. The cheapest times of the year to travel, the dead weeks are in January (until Martin Luther King Day) and February (excluding Valentine’s Day and Presidents Day, which fall around the same time this year). Also: the first two weeks of December. The first two weeks of June — shoulder season — will offer good deals this year, too, particularly for flights to Europe. Late August could also provide discounts, since kids are going back to school earlier these days. “Airfare sales for summer will kick in around August 19,” said McGinnis. But don't travel the last two weeks of March this year, if you can avoid it, said McGinnis. It’s spring break and Easter. “It’ll be one of the most crowded, most expensive spring breaks we’ve seen in awhile,” McGinnis said. Use little-known sites that specialize in scrounging around for the least expensive airfare deals. Kepnes favors The Flight Deal[http://www.theflightdeal.com/], Airfare Watchdog[http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/] (Johnny Jet likes it, too) and Holiday Pirates[http://www.holidaypirates.com/] as well as these two that Pauline Frommer recommended: Momondo[http://www.momondo.com/] and SkyScanner.[http://www.skyscanner.com/] “Momondo doesn’t use cookies, so they don’t track your search,” said Frommer. “That means, if you come back later, they won’t come back to you with higher prices because they know you were looking.” Kepnes urges you to get on the mailing lists of these sites so you’ll hear about cheap flights and mistake airfares. “The really good deals are gone like that,” he noted. He also uses Google Flights[https://www-google-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/flights/], where you can type in the city you’ll fly out of and then click “everywhere” (under Discover Destinations/Places) to get a map of the world with current flight prices all over. “Then you can say, ‘Oh, I see it’s cheap to go to Brazil right now.’” One caution: Watch out for so-called “basic fares” from American (AAL, US) and Delta (DAL, US). “They’re really, really ugly,” said Pauline Frommer. These fares don’t let you choose a seat and, worse still, won’t let you change a ticket even for a fee. How to save on lodging Try an assortment of sites to find budget hotels. Kepnes suggests starting with Priceline and Expedia and then expanding to Travel Pony[http://www.travelpony.com/], Agoda[http://www.agoda.com/] (for Asia) and Tingo[http://www.tingo.com/] (“which searches a ton of sites at once”). A Frommers survey found that HotelsCombined.com and Trivago offered the best hotel deals. “Trivago wasn’t best for budget hotels, but was good for middle-priced and expensive hotels,” said Pauline Frommer. She also suggested trying The Bidding Traveler[http://www.biddingtraveler.com/] which will — shhh! — tell you how much it bid on Priceline and the names of the hotels it got, which Priceline won’t reveal until you book. When you find a hotel you like, call it. By asking for a better rate than what you found online, you may just get one, said Kepnes. Also, said McGinnis, inquire about the location of the room; you can probably nail a more comfortable one. “You’re much likely to get a better room than one the property management computer program picks out,” he noted. Sign up for Groupon and get its hotel deals emailed to you. “The only downside,” said Iannucci, “is that you have to pay for the hotel ahead of time.” But the savings can be large. “We went to the Orlando area last summer and got a deal with two bedrooms and a kitchen for $400 for a week — plus breakfast included every morning.” Try an apartment rental. “It’s often cheaper than a hotel and away from the tourist areas,” said Kepnes. “It’s a great way to meet locals, too.” Kepnes boasted that he and a friend split a room in “ridiculously expensive” St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands) for $35, where the cheapest hotel room was $100.” You can find apartments through sites like Airbnb[https://www.airbnb.com/], WIMDU[http://www.wimdu.com/], VRBO[https://www.vrbo.com/] (Vacation Rentals by Owner) Roomorama[https://www.roomorama.com/] and HomeAway[https://www.homeaway.com/], he noted. How to save when spending Use travel credit cards. “They give you better consumer protection, you can check bags free, you can get access to airport lounges and free airport stays,” said Kepnes. “And they can help you avoid foreign transaction fees overseas.” Kepnes’s favorite cards: Chase Sapphire Preferred, Chase Ink (for business), Amex Starwood Preferred Guest Travel, Barclaycard Arrival and Capital One Venture. (You can find more of his advice on the cards at Nomadicmatt.us/hackTRAVEL.) Eat where the tourists don’t. “I always go five blocks in any direction from the tourist area,” said Kepnes. “You can get much better food at half the price.” He’s also a fan of meal sharing at a resident’s home. Sites like EatWithaLocal.com[http://eatwithalocal.socialgo.com/] let you dine in one with a small group. “For $20, you can get an amazing pasta meal prepared by local people and you’ll make new friends,” said Kepnes. One other dining tip from Kepnes: “Don’t ask people ‘Where should I eat?’ Say: ‘Where do you eat?’” His reasoning: “If you say ‘Where should I eat?’ they’ll assume you want to eat where the tourists do. Change one word around and it gives you a whole different answer.” More from Next Avenue: 6 Common Misconceptions About River Cruises[http://www.nextavenue.org/6-common-misconceptions-about-river-cruising/] Housesitting: A Fun Way to Travel the World on a Dime[http://www.nextavenue.org/housesitting-great-way-travel-world-dime/] 6 Money Saving Travel Secrets[http://www.nextavenue.org/6-money-saving-travel-secrets/]"

Corruption and money laundering are not victimless crimes. The most vulnerable people in the world are harmed by financial secrecy.

Peter Carr, a spokesman, said: We are aware of the reports and are reviewing them. While we cannot comment on the specifics of these alleged documents, the US Department of Justice takes very seriously all credible allegations of high level, foreign corruption that might have a link to the United States or the US financial system. block-time published-time 9.07pm BST The White House’s press secretary was also asked if the US might use the Panama Papers [http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers] as a springboard for a fresh crackdown on lack of transparency in international finance. He responded: I’m not aware of any specific change in policy or the creation of a new body as a result of these documents but they’ve only been public for 24 hours or so now. But whether or not these documents reveal substantive, legitimate evidence of people thwarting monitors of the international finance system, the United States will continue to be a leading advocate of greater transparency in our financial system. block-time published-time 9.06pm BST The White House press corps tried to draw John Earnest, the White House press secretary, specifically on the leaks relating to US allies such as Mauricio Macri, the president of Argentina who hosted Barack Obama last month, and Ukraine’s leader Petro Poroshenko. David Smith reports however that Earnest did not bite, instead praising Poroshenko’s anti-corruption reforms. block-time published-time 9.04pm BST US: Greater transparency roots out corruption The Panama Papers were near the top of the agenda during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, reports David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington correspondent. Asked about the massive data leak, and Russia’s claim that Vladimir Putin is being targeted, John Earnest, the White House press secretary, replied: Obviously we’ve seen the extensive reporting that’s been done on these leaked documents. I don’t have a comment on the specific allegations that are included in those documents. But I can tell you that the United States continues to be leading advocate for increased transparency in the international financial system and in working against illicit financial transactions and in fighting corruption. Earnest had evidently been following the reports and repeatedly batted away attempts to elicit on a comment on specific individuals, contending that the vast scale of the leak means it will take time to digest. Instead he focused on the general implications of opaque financial transactions for US national security. There’s been a lot of talk over the course of the last year or so about how effective US sanctions that are imposed by the Treasury Department can be in advancing the national security interests of the United States. That’s true if we are isolating the Russians because of their violation of the territorial integrity of the sovereign nation of Ukraine or increasingly isolating and pressuring the North Korean regime to give up their pursuit of nuclear weapons or in targeting Isil’s financing operations. So that’s why the United States is a leading advocate of greater transparency in these kinds of international financial transactions. Greater transparency allows us to root out corruption and to fight efforts to get around US sanctions that have been put in place. block-time published-time 8.58pm BST Iceland’s embattled prime minster has been responding to the pressure he is now under after leaked documents showed his wife owned a secretive offshore company with a potentially multimillion-pound claim on the country’s collapsed banks – representing what opponents said was a major conflict of interest. The Guardian’s Jon Henley  reports from Reykjavik [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/icelandic-pm-gunnlaugsson-faces-no-confidence-vote-panama-papers-wife-offshore] that Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson insisted that his two-party centre-right coalition government had always put the interest of the public before his own in dealing with the financial claims – at the cost, he said, of his wife’s financial interests. Jon adds[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/04/icelandic-pm-gunnlaugsson-faces-no-confidence-vote-panama-papers-wife-offshore] : But his political opponents, local media and many ordinary Icelanders still struggling to recover from the crisis – which halved the value of the country’s currency and led to a bailout from the International Monetary Fund – feel Gunnlaugsson should have been open about his family’s overseas assets and the existence of Wintris. “What would be the most natural and the right thing to do is that he resign as prime minister,” said Birgitta Jónsdóttir, of the opposition Pirate party. “There is great demand for that in society; he has totally lost all his trust and believability.” The former Social Democrat prime minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir said Gunnlaugsson should go because he had “displayed his lack of faith in the Icelandic currency and economy”. block-time published-time 8.33pm BST A popular chant among the thousands protesting in the streets of Reykjavik is “Vanhæf ríkisstjórn,” which roughly translaters as “unfit/unqualified Government” It’s a slogan that was popular during the winter of 2008 and afterwards, when thousands of Icelanders took to the streets amid the collapse of the banking system and the currency[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/22/iceland-recession-banking-collapse], the krona, which left Iceland saddled with debts that were at one point 11 times its national income.

The pressure on Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, and his government, comes after leaked documents showed his wife owned a secretive offshore company with a multi-million pound claim on the country’s collapsed banks – representing what opponents said was a major conflict of interest. As opposition parties called a vote of no confidence for later this week and an online petition demanding Gunnlaugsson’s resignation garnered (in a country of 330,000 people) more than 23,000 signatures, thousands of protesters gathered outside parliament in central Reykjavik for an evening protest, chanting, banging drums, blowing whistles and waving bananas – symbolising the belief of many that they were living in a banana republic. Arntho Haldersson, a financial services consultant, said: He’s just lost all credibility. After all this country has been through, how can he possibly pretend to lead Iceland’s resurrection from the financial crisis? He should go. Anna Mjoll Gudmundsdottir, a tourism researcher, said: These people, they say they’ve learned the lessons from what happened to us in 2008, but they’re still just hiding our money. Tinna Laufey Asgeirsdottir, a university professor, agreed He’s not been forthright. If people had been informed of this they might have voted differently.

But the disclosures raise legitimate questions for an ongoing public debate about the ethics of tax havens, whether there should be more transparency from those go offshore, and whether they will continue to do so following the revelations in the Panama Papers.

But it’s useful in that it doesn’t only give us a general idea but gives us a very clear picture: a specific account full of cash, and we can see the whole scheme of how it works and which businessmen are filling up this account.

Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images The office of Diane Abbott, the shadow secretary of state for international development, has been in touch with some strongly-worded quotes from her about the revelations, which she says are part of a broader picture: We knew global corporations were avoiding tax, now the Panama Papers leaks have shown us that world leaders are at it too. But Panama is only the tip of the iceberg. Britain itself is the head of the world’s largest financial secrecy network, and is facilitating tax avoidance by refusing to make its overseas territories expose the names of the individuals and companies that are hiding their wealth there. Britain’s refusal to shut its tax havens also makes possible tax avoidance by global corporations and global leaders. This is a stitch-up. Meaningful reform of the tax system in the interest of the public is being prevented due to the interests of the world’s rich and powerful, who are making a killing. Those literally being killed from this cosy deal are the world’s poor. Every year around $200bn of untaxed income is taken out of poor countries by the international corporations operating on their territory.

Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Some more UK reaction, this time focusing on David Cameron’s plans for an international anti-corruption summit in London in May. Transparency International[http://www.transparency.org.uk/], which campaigns on corruption issues, has said such efforts must include a crackdown on the many ways wealthy people can shelter their money from tax. Robert Barrington from Transparency International UK said: The Panama Papers seem to confirm the evidence from elsewhere that the world’s corrupt elite are gaming the international financial system to launder and protect their stolen wealth. The only way to stop this grand corruption is through governments, businesses and others coming together and rejecting dirty cash as illegitimate. The time has come to stop turning a blind eye to anonymous purchases of luxury property and goods, refuse to issue unvetted investment visas and create a legal framework that is fit for purpose in detecting flows of dirty cash. The prime minister’s anti-corruption summit in May is the perfect opportunity to address these issues, but will only do so if the agenda is ambitious and those who are complicit in grand corruption are not allowed into the room to torpedo effective action. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.17am BST block-time published-time 10.16am BST The South Africa-based African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting is also among the media groups going over the leaks.

Here are some quotes from Anders Dahlbeck, who has the title of tax justice adviser at ActionAid : The latest in a string of tax revelations, this massive use of tax havens yet again demonstrates that the international tax system is broken. Those with the means to do so are able to break the rules on a massive scale, benefiting at the expense of ordinary citizens. And it’s not just individuals who benefit from the global network of tax havens. Big companies can use some of the same offshore methods to reduce their tax bills in the UK, and in some of the poorest countries in the world. The poorest people are hit hardest by corporate tax avoidance: the IMF estimates that developing countries lose out on $200bn a year in avoided corporate tax. Women and girls living in poverty pay the price as key public services like schools and hospitals are starved of funding. The UK government should lead on reforming the global tax system to tackle tax avoidance around the world. The chancellor’s support for public country-by-country reporting is a good start, but we need a concrete plan as to how this will be implemented to ensure multinational companies start paying their fair share. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.15am BST block-time published-time 9.52am BST Among the 107 media organisations around the globe who are poring over the files is Fusion, the US news channel and website.

While serious newspapers such as Vedomosti[http://www.vedomosti.ru/] ran detailed articles on the Panama documents on Monday, there was no mention of the leaks on state television and little mention by the country’s main news agencies. So far there has been no reaction from the Kremlin, though Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov pre-empted the story last week, after receiving a request for comment on the allegations. Peskov warned a smear story about Putin was being prepared and suggested it had been ordered by western intelligence agencies with the goal of discrediting Russia. The leaks are the subject of lively debate on social media, but while Russian anti-corruption activists praised the investigation, some Russians even among the liberal opposition say the claims against Putin’s inner circle are perhaps unsurprising and not interesting. Political and civil society activist Alena Popova wrote on Facebook: “For a western audience it would be a reason for a politician to resign, but here it isn’t a reason, it’s far from it … Society has become accustomed almost on a genetic level that politicians can steal from our pockets.” block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.13am BST block-time published-time 9.27am BST If you’ve not yet seen it here’s the much-watched video of Iceland’s prime minister, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, walking out of a TV interview after being asked about alleged links he and his wife have to offshore holdings[http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/iceland-pm-calls-snap-election-offshore-revelations].

We have asked the ICIJ to share the leaked data that they have obtained with us. We will closely examine this data and will act on it swiftly and appropriately. Our message is clear: there are no safe havens for tax evaders and no one should be in any doubt that the days of hiding money offshore are gone.

Rescue Canada's floundering coast guard: Editorial,Iceland,"Battered by political neglect, understaffing and an aging fleet, the Canadian Coast Guard[http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/eng/CCG/Home] is in desperate need of rescue. And its plight comes at a difficult time. Thinning ice due to global warming, especially in the Arctic, has resulted in a longer navigation season and increases in shipping and tourism. That can only expand in the future, but the coast guard is already failing to keep up. Given its crucial search-and-rescue role, as well icebreaking, responding to oil spills and other environmental disasters, providing aids to navigation, and managing marine traffic, a breakdown at this vital agency could have catastrophic consequences. “For such a critical piece of transportation infrastructure, the Canadian Coast Guard is not receiving the political attention or the administrative and financial resources it requires,” a recent federal report warns. “Not only is it understaffed, but its fleet is one of the oldest in the world and urgently requires renewal.” The warning flare is included a sweeping, 511-page review[http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/ctareview2014/canada-transportation-act-review.html] of Canada’s transportation systems tabled in the House of Commons. And it’s vital that Ottawa begin to take steps to correct what’s wrong before disaster strikes, even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s new government embarks on a review of the nation’s defences, and juggles programs to rebuild the navy and air force. The coast guard’s 119-vessel fleet is also rusting out. According to the report, prepared for Transport Canada, almost a third of its large ships are more than 35 years old, and 60 per cent of smaller boats are past their 20-year design life. As the need for repairs grows, more ships are being kept out of service. That’s having an impact on the water. “The Canadian Coast Guard’s icebreaking presence in the Arctic is decreasing, while vessel traffic is increasing,” wrote the report’s authors. Without renewal “it will have to pull ships from service, further reducing reliability.” It’s ironic that the coast guard has sunk to such a state in a country with the world’s longest coastline, lapped by the waters of three oceans. The previous Conservative government can be blamed for much of this mess. The agency’s budget in 2014-15 was a modest $644 million. And progress has been painfully slow on promises to expand the coast guard’s ice breaking capabilities and build additional patrol vessels. According to the report, Canada’s current national shipbuilding and procurement strategy[http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2016/01/06/fix-canadas-botched-military-procurement-editorial.html] “can only replace one ship a year, at most.” That’s not enough to lower the median age of the fleet. It may be necessary to expand this country’s shipbuilding capacity. Authors of the report note that the one-ship-a-year replacement rate is largely due to a policy requiring the coast guard to purchase vessels from Canadian shipyards of limited capacity. “Other strategies, such as outsourcing or leasing, are not part of the (procurement) strategy and thus cannot be deployed to meet short-term requirements.” Fixing the coast guard is further complicated by the fact that this is a civilian agency, unlike in the United States, Russia, Iceland, and other northern jurisdictions where the service is a military or security organization. As a result, the Canadian Coast Guard doesn’t have power to enforce national or international laws or environmental regulations without an RCMP officer on hand. In the words of the report, this has produced “an inefficient enforcement regime.” That’s a concern for sovereignty. A deep and major revamping of the service seems in order. The agency is the country’s eyes and ears on surrounding seas. From oil spills to sinking cargo ships — it’s Canada’s first responder when marine disasters strike. It’s up to the Liberal government to take action. However Ottawa opts to address these growing deficiencies, it needs to start work now to protect this service and those who rely on it."
These two changes in the ocean are downright scary; Oceans are warmer and more acidic than ever before in recorded history,Iceland,"Oceans are warmer and more acidic than ever before in recorded history The oceans are warmer and more acidic than ever before in recorded history, and likely ever since modern humans evolved. That should worry everyone alive today. Why? As go the oceans, so goes the health of the globe. Oceans produce more than half the oxygen we breathe, and are critical to regulating the climate. They have absorbed at least 90% of the heat from global warming since 1970, and continue to absorb 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, equal to the weight of all the oil carried by supertankers annually. This carbon dioxide makes seawater more acidic and kills off many animals that have shells, including many of the smallest animals that feed life in the ocean. It’s clear that burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of these changes. If we continue on our current path of carbon emissions, we can expect ocean warming to accelerate, with temperatures rising twice as much in the next 40 years as they did in the past 140, further disrupting ocean life and the people who rely on it. Sea levels could rise by up to 6 feet by the end of the century — which would flood parts of many East Coast cities, including New York City. We can already see that climate change is reshuffling ocean life like a deck of cards. For some, this is a winning hand. Fishermen have caught species they’ve never caught before, including blueline tilefish off New Jersey and Humboldt squid in Washington state. For many others in the $6 billion U.S. seafood and fishing industry, however, this rapid warming and acidification has brought uncertainty and instability. The $110 million West Coast shellfish industry nearly collapsed over the last decade as acidified ocean water effectively dissolved billions of young oysters before they could grow. On the East Coast, unusually warm water temperatures appear to have killed surf clams in large numbers off the shores of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. This is one of the largest fisheries in the region, and a major processing plant in Virginia has already closed, only to reopen in New England where the clams are still doing well. A similar story describes lobsters in Long Island Sound. The fishery crashed around 2000 after a string of extreme warm summers, and it hasn’t recovered. Cod, the superlative white fish on dinner plates around the world and the species that first attracted Europeans to North America, is expected to become scarce in U.S. waters as temperatures continue warming. Away from the U.S., a rapid increase in deadly marine algae off the coast of Chile, driven by warmer oceans, killed up to 20% of the country’s farmed salmon, including millions at four fish farms owned by New York-listed salmon farmer Marine Harvest ASA.(MHG, US) (MHG, NO)  Chile is the world’s second-largest producer of salmon, and the algal bloom has driven up prices for consumers. Read: How toxic algae are threatening humans and wildlife across the world Ocean warming has also destabilized international politics. While no shots were fired, the Mackerel Wars from 2010 resulted from a sharp disagreement between Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, Norway, and the European Union when schools of the valuable fish moved much further north than usual. With everyone catching the fish–and refusing to cooperate and set sustainable catch levels–the stock faced a double (or rather quadruple) jeopardy and was threatened with a collapse. The issue was only resolved in 2014 after trade sanctions and threats eventually led to an agreement to divide the catch equitably. Even tourism could be affected. An underwater heat wave is devastating huge swaths of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, a Unesco world-heritage site. The warm temperatures stress the corals, which bleach, revealing the white skeleton underneath. If the heat stress is sustained, the coral begins to starve and will eventually die. The key point is that these changes are happening now, not in some distant future, and they affect our economy and our dinner plates, as well as our planet. Avoiding further damage to marine life and further economic impacts will take a two-pronged approach: rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid further global warming, and a new approach to ocean management that can adapt to the unavoidable changes without opening the doors to overfishing. Achieving this will require new science to more effectively set sustainable fishing levels for a warmer, more acidic ocean, as well as greater incentives to use the science we already have. We can still recover from many of the changes to the ocean so far, but the window for doing so is closing fast.

House prices on the sprint in host cities,Iceland,"As Londoners get ready for race day, Fiona Brandhorst analyses the 26 marathon locations with the hottest property markets Every year, thousands of runners pound the pavements of the world's most recognisable cities, as they challenge themselves to complete a marathon. Often unwittingly, they race down some of the most prestigious streets and past the front gates of many desirable addresses. As runners prepare for tomorrow's London marathon, we analyse the 26 marathon cities that have seen the fastest growth in property prices over 2015. Shenzhen, China 1 This former fishing village and now China's ""Silicon Valley"" recorded the highest annual property price growth of any marathon city in the world. Property prices in Shenzhen rose by 50 per cent last year, driven up by a frenzy of borrowing as a burgeoning middle class of young workers - the population of 10 million has an average age of 30 - clambered to get on the property ladder. New-home prices have jumped 39 per cent, but buyers are now required to deposit 40 per cent of the purchase price to try to curb rising prices. Average price: RMB 3,961 (£426) per sq ft. Auckland, New Zealand 2 Annual price growth in Auckland jumped 25.4 per cent, leading to lower rates of home ownership. It's considered to be New Zealand's most cosmopolitan city. Waterfront estates, especially close to the Waitemata Harbour, are considered the place to live. Average house price: NZ$790 (£383) per sq ft. Istanbul, Turkey 3 Property prices in this Unesco World Heritage Site straddling Europe and Asia grew 25 per cent, according to Knight Frank's Global Cities Index. The weakening of the Turkish lira against the American dollar and British pound brought increased foreign investment in property last year. Sariyer is one of the most desirable residential enclaves and in November, 7,000 marathon runners will skirt pricey Besiktas. Average house price: 291 lira (£72) per sq ft. Sydney, Australia 4 Local and foreign investors in Sydney, as well as downsizers, drove a 19.9 per cent surge in property prices. Michelle Ciesielski of Knight Frank Australia says low interest rates and investment in infrastructure is attracting local investors. Most foreign investors are from Asia, many sending their children to school or university in the city with a population of 4.5 million. Properties nearest Sydney's business quarter and harbour average AU$2,038,000 (£1.1 million) for a house and AU$887,500 (£482,650) for an apartment. Sydney's marathon in September is one of the world's largest, with 34,000 runners. Ave house price: AU$237 (£129) per sq ft. Shanghai, China 5 A total of 255 luxury apartments and houses worth over 20 million yuan (£2,176,666) each sold in the first two months of 2016, according to Knight Frank. Favourable policies including the reduction of mortgage rates and taxation, the new supply of luxury homes and the high land prices are combining to fuel the property market. Prices have soared by 18.2 per cent. Average house price: RMB 3,627 (£390) per sq ft. Budapest, Hungary 6 Budapest is the strongestperforming capital city within Knight Frank's Index, where prices increased by 16.3 per cent in 2015. The city's value combined with an exclusive investment immigration bond programme for Chinese nationals, fast tracking residency to six months instead of five years, has fuelled demand. Bisected by the Danube, Budapest's hilly Buda side is more expensive than Pest. Average house price: €111 (£88) per sq ft. Stockholm, Sweden 7 Low interest rates and an undersupply of new homes caused prices to climb by 15.6 per cent in Stockholm - one of Europe's fastestgrowing cities. Östermalm is one of the most expensive places to live. Ave house price: 5,271 krone (£454) per sq ft. Gothenburg, Sweden 8 Prices rose by 14.4 per cent in 2015 in Gothenburg. A new residential area of the city is being planned in Älvstaden to provide 15,000 new homes. The city hosts one of the world's smallest marathons, with 1,000 competitors in October. Ave house price: 3,716 krone (£320) per sq ft. Vancouver, USA 9 Vancouver is North America's property hotspot, with prices rising 12.9 per cent in 2015. Kevin Skipworth of Dexter Associates says: ""Demand is extremely strong, with stock shortages causing prices to rise significantly."" Low interest rates and the Canadian dollar having dropped against the US dollar have made property investment attractive. The city hosts one of the world's most scenic urban marathons, where 5,000 competitors run through parks, past beaches and alongside the seawall. Ave house price: CAN$476 (£261) per sq ft. Ljubljana, Slovenia 10 A limited supply of housing and the strict restrictions on land planning have contributed to the 12.8 per cent house price growth in the Slovenian city. Average house prices are unavailable. Durban, South Africa 11 Values saw an 11.6 per cent price growth last year in the busy port and manufacturing hub. An increasing number of buyers from China and Dubai are looking at Durban and Umhlanga is one of the most desirable neighbourhoods, with new beachfront apartments and family homes in the Mount Edgecombe Estate some of the most expensive in the country. Average house prices are unavailable. Portland, USA somethings are flocking 12Twenty-to Portland in Oregon, where a boom in the technology and creative marketing industry is pushing both home values and rents higher. Asking prices rose by 11.5 per cent last year and bidding wars are becoming commonplace, with some homes selling for US$150,000 (£105,615) above the list price, according to agent Rachel Freed at Urban Nest Realty. Ave house price: US$318,800 (£210,344) per sq ft. London, UK 13 On average, prices across London rose 11.4 per cent to the end of 2015, fuelled by activity in zones three and four. However, values in the luxury core of the city have dropped 10 per cent due to stamp duty hikes and oil and gas companies pulling executives out of the UK, according to Wendy Perez at Knight Frank. Average house price: £657 per sq ft. Amsterdam, Netherlands 14 The canalside homes overlooking the river Amstel are the most popular homes in the city where, on average, values rose 10.9 per cent. Small pads in the outer suburbs start from around €100,000 (£79,737), with a large house in the centre selling for around €5 million (£3.99 million). Average house price: €486 (£382) per sq ft. Copenhagen, Denmark 15 Demand for housing is finally strengthening after a slow recovery from the global financial crisis. Prices rose by 10.8 per cent last year. Average house price: 2,800 kroner (£296) per sq ft. Beijing, China 16 Thirtysomethings, are queuing up to buy luxury homes in Beijing. Prices rose by 10.4 per cent last year. Average house price: RMB 3,300 (£355) per sq ft. San Francisco, USA 17 Prices grew by 10.4 per cent in California's tech city last year, and fears of a property bubble are growing. Analysts at the ratings agency Fitch say they market is ""overheating"", and values have ""risen to a level unsupportable by area income"" driven up by the arrival of tech workers who are flooding the region. Average house price: $868 (£603) per sq ft. Malmö, Sweden 18 Values rose 10.2 per cent last year in Sweden's third largest city, which has shed its industrial roots to attract biotech and IT companies. The prestigious Fridhem neighbourhood in western Malmö is within walking distance of beaches and the city centre. Average house price: 2,569 krone (£221) per sq ft. Seattle, USA 19 This west coast city has seen strong migration, low unemployment, increasing wages and heavy expansion of the local tech scene. Construction of new housing has not kept pace with the strong demand from increasingly wealthy homebuyers, meaning prices continue upwards at a rate of 10 per cent a year. Average house price: US$400 (£277) per sq ft. Melbourne, Australia 20 Melbourne has been named the world's most liveable city for the fifth year in a row by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Values grew by 9.9 per cent in 2015. Detached houses with large gardens are the most common properties outside the inner city, and its most exclusive neighbourhood is Toorak. Average house price: AU$816 (£442) per sq ft. Dallas, USA 21 Prices rose by 9.5 per cent last year. Dallas has a strong industrial and financial sector and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. Average house prices: US$139 (£97) sq ft. Toronto, Canada 22 Toronto's £( property market is red hot, with the average price of a detached house in the suburbs achieving CA$1.2 million (£654,174) last month. Low interest rates, strong employment and immigration are positive economic factors, as well as Chinese investors buying family homes for the full asking price. Price growth was 9.5 per cent last year. Average house price: CAN$389 (£213) per sq ft. Oslo, Norway 23 Property in Oslo costs 9.2 per cent more than it did a year ago. The uplift is partly caused by low interest rates and weakened economic activity, which is a result of falling oil prices. But the city boasts some of the country's highest earners. Wealthy Norwegian families and most expats tend to live in the west of the city. Average house price: 5,378 kroner (£460) per sq ft. Reykjavik, Iceland 24 The number of tourists visiting the Icelandic city is putting upward pressure on property prices. According to Knight Frank, values rose by 9.2 per cent last year.

REALITY CHEQUE [CORRECTED],Iceland,"Correction: In the ""Reality Cheque"" feature (Rich List Magazine, last week) we wrongly stated that Alisher Usmanov is Ukrainian. He was born in Uzbekistan. The crisis in the steel industry,plunging oil prices and a retail slump have turned some of Britain's biggest winners into losers. Who are this year's Rich List casualties? John Arlidge picks through the carnage They say the rich get richer, while the poor get poorer. Not this year. Some of the richest people in Britain are a whole lot poorer than they were 12 months ago,The Sunday Times Rich List of the 1,000 wealthiest people in the country, published today, reveals. Take Lakshmi Mittal.A few years ago, he became the wealthiest Briton of modern times,with a record fortune of £27.7bn at its peak — 1m times the average wage in Britain.Today, however, he and his family are worth £7.12bn, barely one-quarter.The Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal steel company,which Mittal runs, lost £5.5bn last year and suspended paying dividends. Mittal's stake in the firm that he founded is now worth £3.3bn — more than £21bn offits Rich List peak.The rest of the family's wealth comes from dividends paid in the good times, property and other businesses. For the 65-year-old head of the family, with steel in his bones and who is used to earning £300m a year from those dividends, it is a sobering reversal of fortune. Mittal's father, Mohan, built up his own steel operation in India before Lakshmi created the vast London-based operation. Despite the sharp fall in his wealth, Mittal is scarcely on his uppers. He and his family live in three houses in Kensington Palace Gardens, London's most exclusive street, that he bought for £300m. Another man who once topped our list is also a heavy loser this year. Len Blavatnik , 58, Britain's richest man last year, who has extensive interests in coal, aluminium and petrochemicals, has suffered a 12% — £1.58bn — fall in his wealth, leaving him with £11.59bn. However, like Mittal, he will not be forced to move out of the Kensington Palace Gardens mansion that he bought in 2004 for £41m. His fellow Ukrainian Alisher Usmanov, 62, has seen his performance wane, along with that of the football team in which he is the second-largest investor,Arsenal . Usmanov, who made his money through steel and iron-ore mines, has seen the value of his numerous company assets fall to £3.67bn. His overall fortune has dipped by almost a quarter — £2.22bn — to £7.58bn. Usmanov prefers a £140m duplex apartment in One Hyde Park, the world's most expensive apartment block, to Kensington Palace Gardens, but escapes to Sutton Place, the Surrey manor house that formerly belonged to J Paul Getty. Other notable fallers this year are the former model-agency owner Carrie Perrodo, 64, her eldest son, Francois, 39, and family, who made their fortune in an Anglo-French oil company called Perenco . It is the biggest infrastructure operator in the North Sea and owns Dorset's Wytch Farm, the largest onshore oilfield in western Europe.As the price of oil has fallen, they have lost 42% of their fortune — £2.45bn — and are now worth £3.35bn. Unlike the wealthier losers, they might now be regretting their decision to spend £150m on three London properties in 2014. Among the multimillionaires, the most high-profile casualty of the last year is the financier Nat Rothschild. Disastrous investments in the oil sector have seen his fortune plummet from £170m to less than £100m, sending him crashing out of the Rich List altogether, after nine years. His father, Lord (Jacob) Rothschild, also a financier, remains on our list with £650m. Nat, like all the other heavy losers this year, has fallen victim to the collapse in commodity prices.The price of oil plummeted from more than $100 a barrel to only $26, before recovering to around $40. The fall in steel prices, due to record production in China, has also hit the superrich, notably Mittal, as well, of course, as workers in steel plants, such as the 4,000 at the Port Talbot works in South Wales that is currently for sale and threatened with closure.The superrich, however, are not facing the prospect of unemployment. Away from commodities, one other high-profile loser this year is the Sports Direct owner, Mike Ashley , 51, who, by his own admission, has been hit by a slowdown in trading.The political controversy over his firm's extensive use of ""exploitative"" zero-hours contracts for its workers hasn't helped. Shares in the Nottinghamshirebased firm have lost nearly half their value since December, leaving the company worth £2.1bn, valuing Ashley's stake at £1.25bn. Overall,Ashley, who also owns struggling Newcastle United football club in which he has invested at least £300m, has lost almost one-third of his fortune (£1.07bn) and is now worth £2.43bn. Another big-name retailer to hit hard times is Lord (Simon) Wolfson, chief executive of Next.After his firm suffered a sales slump, his fortune has dipped £20m to £100m, sending him tumbling offthe Rich List after three years. Ten billionaires who were on last year's list are no longer billionaires — the biggest fall since the financial crisis.They include the Matalan founder John Hargreaves ; the hedge-fund manager Crispin Odey; the steel-maker Lord Paul; and two executives at the commodities trading giant Glencore , Telis Mistakidis and Alex Beard. The declining fortunes of some of Britain's wealthiest people have contributed to the first levelling-offof wealth among the top 0.001% for six years.The number of billionaires in Britain has risen sharply every year since 2010, as Britain, and in particular London, began to recover from the global financial crisis. In 2010-11 Britain minted 20 new billionaires. Overall, their ranks have more than doubled between 2006 and this year. However, only three more billionaires have joined our list this year, taking the total number to 120. Collectively, they are worth £343.943bn, up just 5.79% on the £325.131bn last year.What's more, the number of billionaires in London has fallen this year for the first time since the financial crisis. It's now 77, down from 80 last year. That's a remarkable reversal for a city that has powered through the recession to become the world capital of billionaires, although it still has more than any other city in the world, with 16 more than its nearest rival, New York. There are 13 new members of the 10-figure wealth club.They include the South ireland's high-flyers Success stories across a broad spectrum of the economy have fuelled a rise in the wealth of Ireland's richest 250 to another record high. The Irish high-fliers (pages 104-114) have seen their combined value grow by more than £1.8bn to £56.596bn in the past year. The 20th annual Irish Rich List shows an overall 3.3% rise in wealth. While it might not match the double-digit increases seen in the past two years, there is evidence that the growth is built on solid and sustainable foundations, with information technology, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness and tourism all performing well. Even if the construction sector, currently seeing 9% growth in the Irish economy, were to falter again — and it was the bubble in this sector that triggered the 2008 crash — there is plenty of evidence that the country is in a better position to ride it out. There are eight sterling billionaires, worth a combined £23.49bn — one fewer than last year. Martin Naughton 's electrical-appliance manufacturer, Glen Dimplex, was hit by China's downturn, knocking him offthe sterling-billionaire perch. There are 12 euro billionaires, also down one on last year, with the Ardagh Group packaging manufacturer, Paul Coulson , dropping out of the category. Heading the Irish list for the eighth year are Hilary Weston and her daughter Alannah, representing the Ireland-born side of the £11bn food and retailing family that controls Selfridges , Primark , Penneys, Brown Thomas and Associated British Foods . New entrants include the actor Pierce Brosnan, who was raised in Co Meath, at £60m, and Rory McIlroy, the world's No 3 golfer, at £56m. Cathal Gaffney, who makes the popular cartoons Doc McStuffins, Bing and Octonauts, enters at £42m. Three of the 32 new entrants came from the merger of Paddy Power with Betfair earlier this year: Breon Corcoran , the chief executive, at £50m, Paddy Power's former boss Patrick Kennedy at £55m and its co-founder Stewart Kenny at £53m. Two others who set up Paddy Power with Kenny in 1988 — David Power and John Corcoran — were two of the largest risers on the list, adding a combined £155m to their wealth. The biggest leap was by Pearse Lyons , the Kentucky-based Dubliner whose Alltech animal-feed group added £500m in value to bring his fortune to £1.5bn n African retail tycoon Christo Wiese , at £4.33bn, who now has stakes in the British retailers New Look and Iceland, and who has taken over the Virgin Active gym group; Mark Dixon (Regus offices); Philip Day (Edinburgh Woollen Mill); Simon Nixon (MoneySuperMarket); Sir Arnold Clark and family (Glasgow-based car traders); and David Sullivan (property and media, and the co-owner of West Ham football club). Like the billionaires, Britain's multimillionaires have seen their overall wealth plateau. Every year for the past decade, bar 2009, the baseline fortune needed to enter our list has risen sharply. It took £60m to make the cut in 2006. That rose to £100m last year, breaking the three-figure barrier for the first time. But this year that figure has only nudged its way up by 3%, to £103m.That's the smallest percentage increase since 2012. Among all the losers, there are some remarkable winners this year. Sir James Dyson, 68 — best known for inventing the dual cyclone vacuum cleaner,who is now moving on from household appliances to the ultimate personal appliance, the car — has enjoyed a 43% rise in wealth, making him the first self-made Briton to break the £5bn barrier.That puts him ahead of his nearest rival, the Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson,who is worth £4.52bn after collecting £540m earlier this month,when his Virgin America airline was sold to Alaska Airlines for £1.83bn. In 2015, profits at Dyson's Wiltshire-based firm soared to £448m on sales of £1.7bn, making the firm worth £4.5bn. Other Brits climbing up the list this year are Denise, John and Peter Coates, who run bet365, the world's largest online gambling website. Profits at the Stoke-on-Trent-based firm nearly doubled in 2014-15 to £410.2m, taking its value to £3.5bn. Denise is the largest shareholder, with more than 50%. Over the past 12 months the family's wealth has risen by 60% to £3.765bn, putting them in the top 25 for the first time. The publisher Richard Desmond , 64, who owns Express Newspapers and banked £463m from the sale of Channel 5 in 2014, has almost doubled his fortune to £2.25bn. He gave £1m to Ukip last year. Women are winners this year: there are a record 125 on our list.Almost all of them are involved in ventures with their husbands or other family members, or have inherited their wealth.The highest new entry is Shirley Hill, who shares a £400m fortune with her husband,Vernon.Together they founded Metro Bank . Overall, the richest people in Britain are the Mumbai-born brothers David, 77, and Simon Reuben, 74, who came to Britain in the 1950s and head our list for the first time. They started as traders selling everything from scrap metal to carpets, before moving to Russia in the 1990s to take advantage of economic liberalisation and make their first billion-pound fortune trading aluminium. They returned to London in 2000 and began buying up property.They own prime buildings in Mayfair, including Connaught House in Berkeley Square and the former In & Out Naval and Military Club building on Piccadilly.They plan to turn what was one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs into a 48-room luxury home with a price tag of more than £500m. They also own London Oxford Airport and London Heliport in Battersea and are one of the largest investors in Belmond Hotels, the Orient-Express group.They have holdings in global technology firms and were a lead investor in Metro Bank ,which floated last month at £1.6bn.The brothers are worth £13.1bn, up £3.4bn on last year. There are two more Indian-born brothers in second spot — Sri, 80, and Gopi, 76, Hinduja, who are worth £13bn.They control the Hinduja Group , a multinational industrial conglomerate, and own property in London including the old War Office in Whitehall, which they bought for £300m in March on a 250-year lease and plan to turn into a luxury hotel worth £1bn. Despite his woes, Len Blavatnik is third, with £11.59bn.The Selfridges and Primark owners, Galen and George Weston and family, are fourth at £11bn.The Swiss pharmaceuticals tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli and his British wife, Kirsty, a musician, are fifth,with £9.78bn.Among the 10 richest families, only four contain UK-born leading lights: Kirsty Bertarelli is joined by the Westons (Galen and George),Michel de Carvalho (husband of Charlene De Carvalho-Heineken) and the Duke of Westminster,whose land and property fortune of £9.35bn put him in sixth spot. Among the biggest risers this year is Hans Rausing, 90, the former Tetra Pak chief, who lives in East Sussex. His family wealth has risen by one-third — £2.2bn — to £8.6bn.All profits from the family's Alta Advisers investment-management company go to charity. Family charities include the Sigrid Rausing Trust, which spent £20.5m on human-rights causes in the past year (see interview, page 8), and the Arcadia Fund, which backs cultural heritage and environmental causes. The brewing heiress Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, 61, and Michel de Carvalho , 71, who live in London, are enjoying a 28% — £2.005bn — rise in wealth to £9.15bn. Heineken , founded by Charlene's father, Freddy, has invested £20bn in more than 50 acquisitions since 2000.The firm's share price has soared, valuing it at £33.7bn, which makes the family's stake worth £8.43bn. The Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, 31, joins the Rich List for the first time with £106m. Knocking on the door is Adele, 27, who is worth £85m after the release last year of 25, her first album for four years, which was 2015's bestseller. It shifted 17.4m copies, five times more than the runner-up,Taylor Swift's 1989. Swift's boyfriend, the musician Calvin Harris, is worth £95m in his own right.The Dumfries-born DJ, songwriter and singer has landed lucrative commercial deals, including a music consultancy with the Hakkasan restaurant and nightclub group and the fashion label Emporio Armani. The sisters Cara, 23, and Poppy Delevingne, 29, are a new joint entry in the Young 50 List (30 and under) at £14m. Cara, one of the world's most sought-after models in recent years, strides the catwalk for Burberry , Dolce & Gabbana and Jason Wu. Poppy, 29, has been a face of Louis Vuitton and modelled for Laura Ashley , Julien Macdonald and Anya Hindmarch . London remains the city with the largest number of billionaires (77), ahead of New York (61), San Francisco (57), Hong Kong,(49), Moscow (38), Los Angeles (35), Beijing (33), and Paris (30).America tops the list of countries, with 378 billionaires, ahead of China's 193.The UK is in third place with 120. Germany is a distant fourth with 66, France has 44, Italy 22 and Spain 14 n New entrants include the actor Pierce Brosnan and the golfer Rory McIlroy"
Iceland's restaurants celebrate seafood,Iceland,"Many restaurants are in and around the Old Harbour section of town, home to fishing trawlers, whale-watching vessels, boats in dry dock, gift shops, bike-rental establishments, and the Vikin Maritime Museum, located in a former fish factory, where visitors, between meals, can learn much about the nation's commercial-fishing history, including Iceland's 1958-76 ""Cod Wars"" with England. The restaurants of Old Harbour are informal, family-friendly, formal, pub-like, you-name-it, and they offer anything from raw oysters to mussels farmed in fjords, from ling and redfish to fish and chips served British-style with mushy peas. REYKJAVIK -- Families here, back in the day, almost always had fish for dinner. Fried, boiled, baked. Leftovers? They were saved for the weekend and mixed with potatoes and onions into a seafood hash flavored with salt, pepper, and maybe an herb. The dish, considered a delicacy, was plokk fiskur, or ""mashed fish."" Though simple, plokkfiskur remains an Icelandic signature dish: a must-try when visiting. ""In the old days, it was the cheap specialty, and each housewife had her secret recipe,"" says chef Stefan Ulfarsson, whose family owns Prir Frakkar, the venerable Reykjavik seafood restaurant on the hill above the capital's harbor. I ordered plokkfiskur at Ulfarsson's restaurant recently out of curiosity, not high expectation. I was bowled over. Served with steamed carrots, traditional rye brown bread, and greens, his boiled-cod creation was exquisite. ""It's a most popular dish,"" reports Ulfarsson. ""Fish freshness is key."" Ulfarsson's concoction is scooped onto plates in the restaurant's busy kitchen, topped with a Bearnaise sauce, sprinkled with mozzarella, and lightly browned in a salamander before delivery to a table. ""We dress this household recipe up in a tuxedo,"" says Ulfarsson with a laugh. My wife, delighted with her own order of fried cod cheeks, began attacking the flanks of my plokkfiskur the moment it arrived. ""Just tasting,"" she said, thrusting her fork artfully and shamelessly. Iceland has volcanoes, geysers, waterfalls, bubbling warm lagoons, rugged seacoasts, sheep in pastoral settings, and, now, increasingly, seafood restaurants doing excellent things with its most famous product: fish. The nation is clawing back from its 2008 economic meltdown thanks to seafood exports but now also to tourism. Some 1.7 million visitors, roughly five times the country's population, are expected this year. And they crowd Reykjavik's restaurants, which both savor and tweak tradition. Many restaurants are in and around the Old Harbour section of town, home to fishing trawlers, whale-watching vessels, boats in dry dock, gift shops, bike-rental establishments, and the Vikin Maritime Museum, located in a former fish factory, where visitors, between meals, can learn much about the nation's commercial-fishing history, including Iceland's 1958-76 ""Cod Wars"" with England. Iceland won those ""wars"" and has made good use of the spoils. The restaurants of Old Harbour are informal, family-friendly, formal, pub-like, you-name-it, and they offer anything from raw oysters to mussels farmed in fjords, from ling and redfish to fish and chips served British-style with mushy peas. Several restaurants, among them Saegreifinn, are in low-slung sheds once used by fishermen to store equipment. Saegreifinn is a cheerful eatery with long communal tables inviting strangers to become friendly over mugs of lobster soup or grilled fish kebabs. The restaurant looks like an art gallery with ship's lanterns, paintings of seascapes, a wooden carving of a mermaid. It has a children's playroom. ""Go ahead. Please try it,"" coaxes a bearded young man from Indiana, who is in Iceland with his father to celebrate college graduation. From his plate he forks over a piece of broiled minke whale, which demands two swallows, one involving conscience. Whale is controversial in Iceland as it is elsewhere. But dining on it is a custom. It is on many restaurant menus. It tasted like steak. Within four city blocks along Old Harbour I counted five opportunities for fish and chips. At Icelandic Fish and Chips, diners are lured by the ""catch of the day,"" served with any of 11 tartar-like sauces. My choice for a lunch: a tasty deep-fried, spelt-encrusted tusk with potatoes roasted in olive oil and topped with parsley and a flaky salt processed from the sea in Iceland's remote Westfjords region. Icelandic Fish and Chips, bright and airy, proudly offers organic vegetables and Icelandic beers. Across the street sits a fish and chips wagon where line-caught cod is served with fries in a paper cone; down the street, near the museum, is another cart, this with picnic tables and harbor views. ""We rely on very fresh seafood,"" says Atalsteinn Berediktsson, manager of Snaps, a bistro that opened after the economic crash in a residential and small-business neighborhood near Prir Frakkar. A lively restaurant with an open kitchen and a bar with a sign promoting seven styles of gin and tonic, the place has political history that doesn't exactly mesh with the current scene. A plaque out front says the building once housed a Communist Party coffee house. The Four Tops are on the sound system, and Berediktsson is on a stool, describing how fish heads and bones make broth for the bouillabaisse. He mentions that Snaps salts its own cod in a back room, and he plugs the catch of the day, which at dinner proves to be wolffish, deliciously pan-fried in butter, served on a potato-celeriac puree, and topped with cucumber, red bell pepper, and parsley. ""The food has gotten much better in Iceland,"" says Berediktsson. He credits international travel and the Internet. ""People now know if something is not good."" ""After the financial collapse, foreign things became expensive, so we began focusing more on the domestic, and that, after all, meant seafood, and we have many more seafood restaurants now,"" says Ulfarsson at Prir Frakkar. ""Visitors want fish, fish, fish, and when you have the best ingredient in the world, well, you use it.""

10 Europe road trips that should be on your bucket list,Iceland,"The next time you head to Europe, consider applying the classic American road trip formula to your vacation abroad. Hitting the road in Europe is a great way to get off the beaten tourist path and spontaneously discover small villages, regional cuisine and friendly locals. And you'll surely find plenty of roadside attractions (just maybe not a giant ball of twine). Here are 10 of the best road trip routes to try in Europe. Romantic Road, Germany The Romantic Road, or Romantische Strasse in German, is one of Germany's most popular tourist routes. That's because it gives visitors a taste of everything that makes the country idyllic: vineyards and the palace in Wurzburg, medieval towns like Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and the soaring Alps and fairytale-like Neuschwanstein Castle near Fussen. No matter what you like to do when you travel, there's something for you along or just off the Romantic Road -- from spa towns to fortified villages. Length: About 240 miles. Best detour: From the southern-most point of the Romantic Road in Fussen, Germany's highest peak, Zugspitze, is about an hour away. Don't forget: Rothenburg ob der Tauber is home to the Kathe Wohlfahrt headquarters. Save room in your luggage for typical German holiday decor, like wooden incense smokers and handmade ornaments. Bordeaux, France, to Bilbao, Spain For anyone who appreciates food, the drive between France and Spain from Biarritz to Bilbao is packed with Michelin-starred restaurants (several of which appear on the 2016 World's 50 Best Restaurants list) and enough food variety to keep even the pickiest traveler satisfied. Start in Bordeaux vineyards with a wine-tasting course at Maison du Vin de Bordeaux before exploring the UNESCO World Heritage-listed city center. In Biarritz, it's all about the beaches like Cote des Basques with Villa Belza, a 19th-century chateau, as your backdrop. Dine at acclaimed Elkano in Getaria, near San Sebastian. Finish the trip in Bilbao with pintxos at Irrintzi. Length: About 208 miles. Best detour: Axpe, Spain, is only about 20 minutes south from Durango off the main road between San Sebastian and Bilbao, but it's worth it for a stop at Asador Etxebarri, where Basque barbeque meets ingredients from the sea in an unassuming village. Don't forget: Make reservations in advance for restaurant heavy-hitters like Mugaritz in San Sebastian (Spain), or L'Impertinent in Biarritz (France). Normandy, France The Normandy coast, best known for its role in the D-Day landings, is a must-visit for history buffs. Begin the trip in Etretat for a walk along the white chalky cliffs with views of natural sea arches. Seaside towns, in particular Hornfleur and Trouville-sur-Mer, are worth a stop. From this direction, Juno Beach is the first of the Operation Overlord beaches you'll hit. About 50 miles of coastline separate it from Utah Beach. Other sobering points of interest include the artificial quays seen at low tide in Arromanches, the American Cemetery at Omaha Beach, and enormous shell craters at Pointe du Hoc. Continue the trip on a more light-hearted note to Mont St. Michel (beware: tourist crowds are no joke) before heading inland to the tiny town of Camembert to sample its the famed cheese of the same name. Finish the trip in Monet's Giverny. Length: About 430 miles. Best detour: Cross into Brittany from Normandy for a visit to St. Malo, about an hour from Mont St. Michel. The walled-in town was once a port for privateers and is now a short ferry ride from the Channel Islands. Don't forget: In addition to cheese, the region is known for its cider and calvados, or apple brandy. If you don't drive by a roadside stand or two, you may be in the wrong place. Trollstigen National Tourist Route, Norway Also known as the Troll's Route, this mountain road, designated as one of Norway's national tourist routes, affords drivers with views of mountains, waterfalls like the Seven Sisters, and the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Geirangerfjord. Like any road trip, this one is best when you get out and explore the areas of the drive between Valldalen and Andalsnes. Get up close to the area's waterfalls by kayaking Geirangerfjord. There are also several historic fjord farms, including Skagefla and Knivsfla. Length: About 65 miles. Best detour: Dovrefjell-Sundalsfjella National Park, a protected alpine area, is home to reindeer, musk ox and wolverines. Hiking and fishing, particularly for trout, are good reasons to stop. Don't forget: Consider traveling in summer as you'll have more daylight, which means more time to explore. High Alpine Road, Austria The Grossglockner Hochalpenstrasse, or High Alpine Road, takes drivers through Hohe Tauren National Park in the eastern Alps with views of Austria's highest mountain, Grossglockner, as well as Pasterze, the longest glacier in the country at about 5 miles. Beyond the 36 hairpin turns, you'll want to get out of the car for a hike to any of the alpine huts dotting the landscape, or go further into the national park for hikes like the easy 5-mile round-trip trail to Stappitzer Lake. Length: About 30 miles, or about 185 miles from Salzburg to Carinthia via Grossglockner. Best detour: From Grossglockner, it's only about 2. 5 hours onward to picturesque towns in the Dolomites, like Cortina d' Ampezzo, or Bled, Slovenia, bordering Triglav National Park. Don't forget: The road closes in early November and reopens in early May, with gates closing at nighttime during the season. Tickets cost 35 euros for a day pass or 41 euros round-trip per car. Electric vehicles and motorcycles receive a discount. Athens to Olympia, Greece While Greece's islands usually hog the vacation spotlight, the mainland is the perfect place for countryside cruising. Start in Athens to explore the ruins (Acropolis, Parthenon, the Temple of Hephaestus, etc. ) before hitting the road to the Laconia countryside. Visit Sparta, the modern city believed to be the site of ancient Sparta, if only to pass through on your way to Mystras. The archeological site of medieval ruins sits among a breathtaking landscape and has the distinction of being on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Finish the trip in Olympia to take in the ruins of temples and the ancient Olympic Games before heading back to Athens. Length: About 420 miles. Best detour: To add more seaside to your trip, head south to Cape Matapan (also known as Cape Tainaron), the southernmost point of mainland Greece. The drive is just over 60 miles from either Mystras or Sparta. Don't forget: The Museum of the Olive and Greek Olive Oil in Sparta is worth a stop for lovers of the Mediterranean fruit. Tuscany, Italy Begin with a visit to Florence before packing up the wheels and taking off into the Tuscan countryside. The first stop is Orvieto, a hilltop town known for its Gothic cathedral, network of caves and Classico wine. Leave your car at the bottom of the hill for free and head up to the medieval town. Make the trip a loop by taking in some of Italy's less-visited coastal areas, starting with Talamone, a small fishing village with an ancient castle towering over it. From there, the beaches of Marina di Grosseto and the Riserva Naturale Scarlino in Follonica are worth stops. The area is known for its agriturismo, so look for farmhouse accommodations. Head back toward Florence with stops in Siena and Castellina in Chianti. Length: About 340 miles. Best detour: Rome is less than 80 miles from Orvieto. As they say, when in (almost) Rome . . . Don't forget: The unleaded gasoline in Italy is benzina verde. Don't use gasolio or diesel unless you have a diesel rental car. Ring of Kerry, Ireland The Irish countryside is the ideal setting for a road trip any time of year. The Ring of Kerry, a route circling the Iveragh Peninsula, gives you variety with mountains and medieval villages, beaches and lakes. The chiseled coastline offers dramatic views, while cozy pubs along the way provide the perfect spot to pop in for a pint and wait out any inclement weather. (But don't drink and drive, obviously. ) Get out for a walk along a stretch of the Kerry Way, a nearly 125-mile walking trail, and pay a visit to Ross Castle and Rossbeigh Beach. Make your trip more relaxing by adding in extra overnight stops at the area's bed-and-breakfasts, renowned for their hospitality. Length: About 110 miles (add 80 miles for the drive from Shannon Airport to Killarney). Best detour: The Cliffs of Moher are about 115 miles north of Killarney. The cliffs stretch 5 miles and tower more than 700 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. From here, you can drive more of the Wild Atlantic Way to extend your trip. Don't forget: Ireland is known for its unpredictable weather. Pack a raincoat and know that while the drive will inevitably be beautiful, you may not get crystal clear views for miles out to sea. Transfagarasan Mountain Road/Highway, Romania Made famous by Top Gear, Romania's national road 7C or Transfagarasan Mountain Road takes you through the Fagaras Mountains, part of the Carpathian range. The maximum speed is 25 miles per hour to account for the hairpin turns and steep climbs. Crossing viaducts and and driving through tunnels, you'll pass through the Arges River gorge and by Poenari Castle, infamous for its connection to Vlad the Impaler (the supposed inspiration for Count Dracula). Stick to 7C around Vidraru Lake, as it's better maintained than the road going along the other side. Check road conditions before you plan your trip, as the road is usually closed from October to June. Length: About 56 miles. Best detour: Bran Castle, commonly called Dracula's Castle, is just over 60 miles from Cartisoara, at the northern point of the Transfagarasan Mountain Road. Add 10 extra miles if you head to Bran from the southern point of the road in Bascov. Don't forget: Splurge on a rental car upgrade. Why not? Ring Road, Iceland Route 1 circles the entire country of Iceland, thus its nickname -- the Ring Road. Starting and ending in Reykjavik makes sense for most travelers flying into the country. Give yourself plenty of time for stopping and exploring the varying otherworldly landscape and dramatic fjords, like Eyjafjordur. Volcanically active areas with lava fields, geysers, mud pools and other geothermal features near Lake Myvatn in the north contrast dramatically with the Vatnajokull ice cap in the southeast, making the case for Iceland's name. In the west, just off Route 1, Thingvellir National Park (also a UNESCO World Heritage Site) shows another side of the islands with rocky outcrops and greenery surrounding traces of Vikings remains. Length: About 830 miles. Best detour: The so-called Diamond Circle is about a 160-mile loop in the northern part of the country. Some of that overlaps Route 1, but get off it to see the coastal town of Husavik, canyon of Asbyrgi and Dettifoss waterfall. Don't forget: Rent a four-wheel drive vehicle so you can tackle any spontaneous trips off the main road. READ THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE: 10 Europe road trips that should be on your bucket list"
Arctic nations square up as clamour for resources grows,Iceland,"With the Danes rebuffing Russia, and Canada laying further claim to the Northwest Passage, rising access to north pole reserves risks flashpoints Kristian Jensen, Denmark’s foreign minister, gave a precise response last week to a request by Russia for the nations to enter bilateral talks over the ownership of the north pole. He flatly rejected the move. “We need to apply the international rules,” he told reporters. The Russian request and the swift Danish response are intriguing. The United Nations is currently assessing Russian, Danish and Canadian claims to own sizeable chunks of the Arctic seabed. The Russian move was generally viewed as an attempt to strike a deal that would cut out Canada, while Denmark appears to believe its case is strong enough to exclude such manoeuvres. One thing is clear. The Arctic is heating up in meteorological, political and environmental terms as nations fall over themselves to exploit the region. Apart from Denmark’s rebuff of Russia’s Arctic overtures, Canadian explorers announced last week they had discovered the wreck of HMS Terror[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt], one of the two ships belonging to British explorer Sir John Franklin’s doomed attempt to sail the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. (The other expedition ship, Erebus, was discovered two years ago.) These two vessels have enormous symbolic importance because Canada believes they support its claim to own the passage, which other nations, such as the US, argue is international waters. Then there were the recent moves by China to invest in mines in Greenland[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt], where declining ice cover is exposing vast outcrops of ores, including minerals crucial to mobile phone manufacture. Similarly, drilling companies are eyeing seabed reserves of natural gas and oil while travel companies are preparing to send huge cruise liners into the region. The first of these trips, by the Crystal Serenity[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises], has just been completed. Enormous forces, political and commercial, are bearing down on the region although all have a common root – as was also highlighted last week. Summer sea ice, which once covered 7.5 million sq km around the north pole, this year dropped to 4.13m sq km, its second lowest figure on record, it was announced.[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded] The rate of annual change – brought about by soaring fossil fuel emissions and rises in global temperatures – is now equivalent to a loss greater than the size of Scotland. “Loss of sea ice has local to global effects, from animals and ecosystems to encouraging further warming by exposing ocean water,” said Twila Moon, at Bristol University. “We should all be shocked by the dramatic changes happening in the Arctic.” Most scientists now expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of the century. By “free” they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by “reliably”, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however. “The Arctic is opening up, and all sorts of flashpoints lie ahead,” said Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. “If the central Arctic Ocean is freed of ice for several months a year, who will control the fishing and the dumping of waste there? The Russians have also made it clear they want to drill for oil and gas.” This point was also stressed by Professor Chris Rapley, of University College London. “An increasingly ice-free Arctic is a geopolitical game changer,” he said. Already there are profound changes, with invasive species pouring into the warming Arctic and threatening existing populations, according to Melanie Lancaster of WWF’s Arctic programme. “Specialised Arctic species such as polar bears [are already] showing signs of stress. Conservation action is urgently needed.” However, the Arctic, its wildlife and its four million inhabitants face a major handicap: the region’s lack of centralised protection and control. The Antarctic Treaty bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military and strictly monitors all environmental hazards around the south pole. By contrast, although no nation owns the north pole, the Arctic nations – Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark – have very different ideas about how to run the world’s most northerly regions. “Arctic environmental protection is currently determined by individual nations, by politicians who often meet far from its borders: in Moscow, Copenhagen and Washington,” said Professor Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia. “They have very different levels of commitment to protecting the environment – with Russia at the bottom and the Nordic nations at the top.” And it is not just the Arctic nations who are eyeing up the riches around the north pole. China recently assigned itself the status of being “a near-Arctic state”. It views the opening Arctic seas as an opportunity to maintain its access to the world’s most important resources. Some of the Earth’s major stocks of fish are migrating north as the planet heats up while the Arctic’s mineral resources are being exposed by retreating ice. “The Chinese have made no secret that they have their eyes on the Arctic’s fish and minerals,” said Dodds. This raises the question of what the Inuit and other Arctic people think about resources being exploited by others. “They are not against resource development but they do like to be consulted and involved,” said Dodds. “They do not want to be cheated. However, there are often disagreements within communities about the choices they have to make. Will a mining development ruin a village’s tourist potential, for example?” Byers was cautious. “I have enormous sympathy for the local peoples in the Arctic but they are few in number and have limited resources. They are trying to insert themselves into the decision-making of some of the most powerful companies and countries in the world,” he said. Relations with indigenous people are one of the flashpoints that may trigger serious disputes in the region. There is already bitterness among the Inuit about their treatment in the past and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is currently investigating the serious abuse that thousands of children received[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/canada-dark-of-history-residential-schools] in residential schools last century. That resentment could colour future attempts to develop the region. Of all the Arctic nations, Russia has been the most determined to exploit the region as it warms, however. “You can see that determination in the way it responded to the Arctic 30 incident,” said Duncan Depledge, Director, All-Party Parliamentary Group for Polar Regions Secretariat. In 2013, Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform as part of a protest against Arctic oil production. Russians arrested them at gunpoint[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic] and charged the activists initially with piracy and later with hooliganism and only released them after two months of detention. “That is an indication of how seriously they take the Arctic,” added Depledge. This point was backed by Dodds: “The Russians are hell bent on showing the world they mean business here.” Could that determination lead to an outbreak of hostilities? Byers was not convinced. “The Arctic is a very expensive region in which to operate and Russia is not a wealthy country. The cost of militarising the Arctic would be prohibitive. They might want to police it so that they can control outfits like Greenpeace but I don’t see them having a war with another Arctic nation.” The implications for the region are still worrying, nevertheless. As Rapley stated: “The ongoing thinning [of Arctic summer sea ice] is especially significant and the implications are profound. The Arctic nations are jostling for advantage, and the economic and ecological consequences of new trade routes opening up have yet to unfold. The changes that have occurred have been greater and faster than predicted. The planet is sending a clear message: time is running out.”"
Sofus Poulsen,Iceland,"Diplomat Born: July 12, 1929; Died: August 19, 2016 SOFUS Poulsen, who has died aged 86, was a Danish diplomat who for many years served as the Faroe Islands’ representative in the UK. He was appointed an assistant in Faroe’s diplomatic office in Aberdeen in 1948 and served there as the commercial attache from 1980 to 2002. Faroe is a mountainous archipelago of 18 inhabited islands under the Danish Crown but it has had home rule since 1948. It lies in the North Atlantic, just over 200 miles north-west of the Scottish mainland, with a population that passed 50,000 for the first time in 2015. For many years Mr Poulsen was the highest-ranked foreign diplomat based in Scotland at Faroe’s office in Market Street, Aberdeen. He was replaced after his retirement by a Faroese diplomat based at the Royal Danish Embassy in London. Mr Poulsen was born in the tiny Eysturoy hamlet of Soldarfjord, one of a line of small settlements on the shores of Skala Fjord, Faroe’s longest sea inlet on the coast of its East Island. His father Oil Poulsen was among 38 fishermen who were killed in 1932 when two Faroese fishing smacks (locally known as sloops) were lost in a hurricane. Mr Poulsen arrived in Aberdeen in 1946 after a 50-hour trip on a fishing boat to represent a Faroese fishing company. The Second World War had reshaped the economy of the islands, which had relied on salted, dried, cod being exported directly to Mediterranean countries, which was impossible from 1940 onwards when Denmark was occupied by the Nazis. Only the British market remained and it demanded fresh produce. About one fish in five landed in the UK from 1940-45 came from Faroe ships, often carrying iced cargoes from Iceland. Britain had garrisoned Faroe as a protectorate for the duration of the war, a move welcomed by most islanders. Mr Poulsen settled into life Aberdeen immediately, meeting his wife-to-be at a Youth for Christ gathering in the city in 1949; the couple were engaged on the third anniversary of their meeting and married exactly two years later in 1954. Later he was active in resolving a dispute between the UK and Faroe over fishing limits and territorial limits. Faroe had a long friendly relationship with the UK but, in 1961, the Aberdeen trawler Red Crusader was fired on by a Danish frigate after she was apprehended for allegedly poaching in waters that the Danes said were forbidden to British ships at certain seasons between six and 12 miles off Faroe. In May 1999, the UN was asked to ratify an end to the long-standing dispute which delineated the Continental Shelf boundary between the UK and Faroe. This was internationally important as major oil and gas fields lie under the seabed off Britain’s zone to the West of Shetland. During his long career, Mr Poulsen met and helped an astonishing variety of people and was renowned for the courtesy he showed to all. For 17 years he was a well-kent face in the far north of Scotland when Scrabster had a weekly summer passenger ferry service to Faroe and Iceland. In 1990, the ferry Smyril was the main transport for British Week when ex-soldiers, pipers and a Royal Marines band travelled north to mark the 50th anniversary of the “friendly occupation” of Faroe by the British. It gave mountainous Faroe its only airport, which these days is its main entry point for all international business and some tourist visitors; its Atlantic Airways runs year-round scheduled services from Edinburgh, while Royal Engineers also built some new roads, although they were nothing to the subsequent causeways, bridges, through-mountain and sub-sea tunnels that link all of Faroe’s main islands. During the anniversary celebrations, it seemed as if the whole of Faroe lined Torshavn’s harbour, while Mr Poulsen arranged for the Royal Marines band to assemble on the ship’s car-deck. When the first ramp was lowered, the Royal Marines band marched ashore, with Mr Poulsen waving away a lone immigration officer who had been demanding to see passports. The Faroe Islands enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, with 20,000 more people living there than when Mr Poulsen arrived in Aberdeen. Faroe voted not to join the European Economic Community along with Denmark, Ireland and the UK in 1973 and remains outside the European Union. On June 7 1999, Mr Poulsen was knighted by Denmark’s Queen Margrethe at Edinburgh Castle for his lengthy, meritorious service. He is survived by his wife Nessie and their family of four grown-up sons, Danny, Charles, Roy and John, grand-children and great-grandchildren. BILL MOWAT"
Ten key questions as the pound goes into freefall,Iceland,"While some investors may enjoy benefits from the climb in the FTSE 100, sterling's rapid fall from grace has potentially dire consequences for holidaymakers, homeowners and expat pensioners, as Roger Blitz reports Cast your mind back to that surreal period just after Brexit. Remember how discombobulated you felt? Leaderless Britain, Tory party turmoil, the spectacular Boris-Gove fallout, England losing at football to Iceland? The pound was in turmoil. It fell about 11 per cent. Actually, that was pretty much expected. Virtually every economist said it was going to be sold off because no one knew what Brexit really meant for the UK economy, so the assumption was it would be bad. The next bit of the summer was not expected - the economy stayed in surprisingly good shape, fears of a post-Brexit recession were put to bed, so the pound rallied. Now, sterling is falling again - by nearly 5 per cent this week to its lowest level since the referendum, which is also its lowest in more than 30 years. Why? Because Theresa May, in her speeches at the Conservative party conference, dispelled any idea that the UK was going to backtrack on Brexit and revealed a deadline for setting the divorce process in motion. The currency market took that to mean that the prime minister was angling for a Hard Brexit - a view reinforced by some trenchant rhetoric from the PM. European leaders agreed and markets resumed their negative post-referendum mood. A so-called "" flash crash "" at one point dragged the pound down to $1.18 and though that fall has largely been unwound, the pound has ended the week in a weary, battered state. ""Error or not, the reaction illustrates that the British exit from the EU has the potential to create considerable disruption on the markets,"" says Commerzbank's Lutz Karpowitz. 1 Who are the winners and losers? Foreign tourists are big winners. They flooded the UK in the summer after the big post-Brexit sterling drop, and if they can brave Britain's weather, they will do so again the next time they have a break. So UK tourist attractions, and other parts of the leisure industry such as restaurants and hotels, also benefit. Other winners are anyone in a hurry to sell a UK asset, such as a house or a company. Foreign buyers may never get a better opportunity. Exporters now have more competitive goods to sell. And hedge funds always like a bear market. The losers ? Brits going abroad. Summer holidays in Europe and elsewhere were expensive and will be more so now, making the idea of staycation holidays more tempting. Car drivers face higher forecourt prices because the UK is a net oil importer and the price of a barrel of oil is going up. And banks find their sterling assets are now depreciating. Lots of people think all of us are losers because the UK economy is now in trouble. 2 Why is the FTSE loving this? Because many companies in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 get their earnings abroad. The likes of HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and Wolseley are all seeing nice boosts to their share prices. Even the mid-cap 250 index, which has a more diverse group of companies that better reflects the UK economy, is enjoying sterling's pain , since it is populated by commodities companies. Interest rates are low so the dividend yield from equities is more tempting than yields from other markets. Caution: this is one way of looking at the FTSE. Another is to measure FTSE companies in dollar terms, and when you do that you see that the FTSE is down over the course of the year. Compared to US companies and other peers, UK companies are underperforming in the long term. Even so, the FTSE may be benefiting from surprisingly good economic data since Brexit and the neutralisation, thus far, of fears about recession. There is also the prospect of a weaker pound firing M&A; activity. ""While we expect Brexit fears to bite at some stage, the strength of the FTSE 100 is reflective of the fact that Brexit hasn't had too much of an impact on the UK economy so far,"" says Kathleen Brooks at City Index. 3 Could sterling fall lower? Most certainly. Let's face it: the government doesn't know how Brexit will turn out, the Bank of England doesn't know, the market doesn't know, companies, shareholders, the man in the street don't know. Many things determine a currency's rise and fall, but in the pound's case Brexit is way ahead of other causes. In crude terms, Brexit could be good or bad for the UK. Right now, Brexit is in the tray marked ""Uncertain"". And since the market hates uncertainty, the chances are that traders' instincts will lean towards selling the pound. Currencies are probably the best proxy for the market's opinion of a country's economy, and when the pound fell sharply in the days after Brexit, the market had effectively downgraded the UK. That much was expected by most economists. What matters to governments and central banks is the size and pace of currency moves. And after a summer lull, when the economy seemed to be doing better than expected, forcing economists to update their sterling forecasts, the pound is again being heavily sold relatively quickly. A pound was worth nearly $1.30 at the start of October. Barely a week later, it is worth closer to $1.24. That's quite a decline. Currencies move in strange ways. There is never a smooth path up, down (or sideways). Richard Bibbey of HSBC says: ""We'll likely see a short period of consolidation before a further period lower. However, if we remain at these levels for a period, the less likely it is to materialise."" 4 What does it mean for investors? Sterling's fall has already had its impact on equities, and it has also made a difference to the cost of borrowing since the Bank of England has begun resuming the purchase of bonds. The next few weeks will be tricky. Will equities run out of steam? Will yields in gilts rise? There were signs of both towards the end of this week, as the reality of Brexit hit that bit harder. Much depends on how much further the pound falls. A more sustained sell-off may spook foreign investors in gilts, thereby driving yields higher . Curiously, the way the market works may end up halting the pound's fall. It may also hurt equities, since low bond yields have been a factor in rising share prices by virtue of their inflationary effect on future cash flows of companies. No one said Brexit was going to be easy. 5 As a consumer, when will I start feeling the impact? Your fuel tank will probably cost more to fill and your holidays abroad have already cost more, which means a staycation not too far from home is your best bet for next summer. At some point, the high street will have to weigh up how to factor in the pound's fall. Retailers' import prices will rise. They will have hedged against currency risk, but those hedges will expire at some point. They can jack up prices for the consumer or swallow the impact of the import rise for fear of losing the customer. The chances are that retailers will see their way through to the end of the year and protect their Christmas sales, and take a view at the start of 2017. Much depends on consumer confidence. This is steady for the moment, but never far away from reversing course, particularly if headlines about rising inflation spook shoppers. The headlines had already started on Friday. 6 What does it mean for the housing market? House-hunters looking to buy in the UK with foreign currency - particularly the dollar or dollar-pegged currencies - have seen their purchasing power soar in recent months. In London, the effect has been accentuated by falling prices at the top end of the market. LonRes, a data provider, said average values paid in US dollars per square foot in central London had fallen by 29 per cent between the peak in 2014 and August this year, ""making prime central London, for those buying in US dollars, the most affordable it has been since 2012"". Estate agents reported a surge in interest , if not completed deals, from foreign buyers. David Adams, managing director of John Taylor, a Mayfair-based estate agent, said there had been a 1,000 per cent rise in such inquiries in the month following Brexit compared to the previous month, and interest had been most acute at the ultra high end of the market for homes above £30m. ""Many more people have been calling to say that they think they should be looking for something,"" he said. However, he was struggling to find the supply of homes to satisfy this demand, since there was a corresponding fall in UK homeowners transacting. ""They don't think now is the right time to move,"" he said. Aaron Strutt, product manager at broker Trinity Finance, said worries among EU nationals living and working in the UK about the prospects of residency controls after Brexit were beginning to lift, and consequently groups such as French and Italian expats were returning to the market. 7 How could it affect my pension? Many of the estimated 1.1m pensioners who have retired abroad will see a dramatic fall in the spending power of any UK state or private pension income . A year ago, £100 would have secured $200 in Australia, one of the most popular retirement destinations for British expats. But this week, the same £100 of income would only return A$169, or 15 per cent less. There were similar falls in spending power for the estimated 400,000 UK pensioners living in the eurozone who receive the UK state pension. ""Currency risk is a major issue for expats,"" said Mike Morrison, pension analyst with AJ Bell, the pension provider. ""It is possible to buy a forward contract for currency exchange, which can provide a level of certainty on the exchange rate but they are mainly used for large purchases such as house purchases."" Mr Morrison says the simplest answer for expat pensioners is to use income from other sources if possible and leave the pension untouched until the pound recovers. ""However, this may not be possible if the pension is the only source of income and it looks like the pound is going to remain weak for some time to come."" 8 What does the rest of the world think? One school of thought suggested some countries were jealous of the UK. In a world of stubbornly low growth, a weaker currency was one way of making your economy competitive. Except that if everybody did it, you would soon be embroiled in a self-defeating currency war, which is why a US-led initiative back in January led the world's developed countries to agree not to target deliberately weaker currencies. Hence when Brexit induced sterling's plunge, the UK looked as if it had accidentally stumbled on a unique way of getting itself a weaker currency. This is all very well if you can manage the currency's fall in a measured way. And that is not what this week's drop feels like. Opportunists around the world will grab UK assets, which have suddenly become cheaper. But will foreign investors see the UK in the same favourable light? If they start to pull out their money on a big scale, that poses problems for servicing the UK's pretty large current account deficit. Bank of America Merrill Lynch says: ""The risks are skewed to a weaker sterling next year amid policy uncertainty and constraints on current account deficit financing."" You have been warned. 9 How can I minimise the impact of sterling's fall? Play the currency markets and hedge against sterling's fall, although it is costly, complicated and by no means foolproof. Alternatively, get on the right side of the pound's weakness - invest in UK exporters, open a bed and breakfast in a popular tourist town or buy shares in a UK-listed energy company which reports its earnings in dollars. The other option is to position yourself for the pound's rise. This is based on believing either that a) sterling has hit the bottom; b) it will rebound on the back of the economy staying resilient; c) Brexit will turn out to be soft and even cuddly; d) a combination of all of these. There were a few economists who believed this a few weeks ago. You may need to wait a while for them to resurface. 10 Is there anything else that's going to move the pound either way? Currencies are two-way. A currency trade happens when one currency is bought and another sold. So when the pound is bought or sold against the dollar, more often than not there are influences on the US side that come into play. Hence, the US election, the state of the economy and the prospect of rate rises across the Atlantic can all push the dollar higher against the pound. Similarly, eurozone developments will affect the pound's level against the euro. US and European influences were coming back into play in recent weeks as fears about Brexit's impact on the UK economy were kept at bay. That all changed this week. UK politics is back at the wheel driving the pound and the quality of driving is erratic, to say the least. Additional reporting by Josephine Cumbo and James Pickford Winter holidays Costs snowball as sterling slides The cost of a skiing holiday at top French, Swiss and Austrian resorts has snowballed as the value of the pound rolls further downhill . As the pound weakens further against the euro, unfavourable exchange rates mean skiers should expect to pay up to 26 per cent more than last season at certain French resorts, according to this year's Ski Resort Report, compiled by Post Office Travel Money. Comparing the relative costs of ski passes, equipment hire, lessons and refreshment on the slopes across a range of skiing resorts, the Post Office found Val d'Isère was the most expensive French ski destination . The cost of a holiday at Austrian ski resorts including Kitzbühel have risen on average by 20 per cent, the survey found, with Swiss resorts including Zermatt - the most expensive of the 20 European resorts surveyed - coming in at 16 to 19 per cent dearer than a year ago."

C-Span, sometimes called the “boring channel,” is a no-frills window into the work done by Congress. The idea for an unfiltered, commercial-free broadcast of events on Capitol Hill came from Brian Lamb, above, a reporter who viewed the concept as a public service. It debuted in 1979[https://www.c-span.org/about/history/] — a year before CNN — first by televising the House’s floor debates. A first-term representative named Al Gore spoke first[https://www.c-span.org/video/?c3344448/first-speech-house]. “Television will change this institution,” he said. Indeed it did. “Most Americans then saw of Congress only what was reported on the nightly news and in newspapers,” The Times wrote[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/business/media/c-span-founder-brian-lamb-to-step-down-as-ceo.html] in 2012. And the lawmakers themselves now routinely follow proceedings on TV, leaving the House and Senate chambers virtually empty. C-Span’s programming includes lectures on books and history, and the confrontational weekly prime minister’s questions[https://www.c-span.org/series/?PrimeMinisterQue] in the British House of Commons. Once in a while C-Span outshines its commercial rivals. In June, Democrats waged a sit-in protest against gun laws for over 24 hours.

China's Arctic ambitions take shape in remote Iceland valley,Iceland,"LAUGAR, Iceland _ In a remote valley near the Arctic Circle where the wind whips the coarse yellow grass, China and Iceland are preparing to look to the sky _ and a shared future. Construction workers are building a research facility to study the Northern Lights, whose spectacular streaks of colour light up Iceland's winter skies. Funded by China's Polar Research Institute, the facility will house Chinese, Icelandic and international scientists when it opens next year. This cement shell is a concrete achievement in the burgeoning relationship between the rising Asian superpower, population 1.37 billion, and this tiny North Atlantic island nation of 330,000 people. It may seem a lopsided friendship, but both countries perceive benefits. Beijing wants an Arctic ally as climate change opens up new sea routes and resource-extraction opportunities, while Iceland seeks heavyweight friends to anchor it against stormy economic waves. ""It is better to be a friend to everyone when you are small than be an enemy to anybody,'' said Reinhard Reynisson, director of the non-profit company building the Aurora Observatory. Reynisson speaks with the confidence of a country that has weathered earthquakes, volcanoes, famine and financial meltdown since it was settled by Vikings in the 9th century. But China's growing interest has also aroused suspicions among some Icelanders, who are wary of big powers trying to grab their resources, whether fish, energy or land. ""We are a very small country, we are only 300,000 people, so we don't look at our independence as an automatic thing,'' said Asgeir Jonsson, an economist at the University of Iceland. ""It's something that you have to protect and look after. ""In our history, we have a long story of fighting with the bigger powers around us over fish and the resources that we have. That has left its mark on the population.'' Iceland was nudged in China's direction by financial calamity. When the global credit crunch hit in 2008, Iceland's banks _ whose debts had ballooned to more than 10 times the country's GDP _ collapsed. Iceland's currency nosedived, unemployment soared, and Iceland was forced to go the International Monetary Fund and the European Union for bailouts. It also began looking for new economic partners to help it rebuild _ and China was willing. In 2010, the two countries agreed currency swaps between Iceland's krona and China's yuan, and in 2013 they signed a free trade agreement _ the first between China and a European country. With Iceland's support, China was granted observer status in 2013 at the Arctic Council, whose core members are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Russia, the United States and Iceland. It also attends annual Arctic Circle Assemblies hosted by Iceland _ gatherings of politicians, officials, scientists and businesspeople to discuss the future of the region. ""China's got a broad range of Arctic interests _ economic, scientific, political, strategic,'' said Anne-Marie Brady, editor in chief of the Polar Journal and a global fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington. ""But the main thing it wants at the moment would be to make sure it has a seat at any decision-making table and has access to any rights that are up for grabs. So it's great to have a friendly state like Iceland.'' Some of the plans discussed by the two countries have been grandly ambitious, such as making a deep-sea port in a northern Iceland fjord to create a major shipping hub on the Northern Sea Route. It remains unbuilt, but the economic relationship between the two countries is growing steadily. Iceland has granted the China National Offshore Oil Company permission to explore in Iceland's waters, and Beijing has tapped Icelandic expertise in geothermal power, a major industry in volcanic Iceland and a potential source of clean energy for China. Last year, Chinese automaker Geely _ owner of Volvo Cars_ announced it was investing $45.5 million in Carbon Recycling International, an Icelandic company that operates the world's first renewable methanol plant. Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is working with Icelandic mobile phone firms and a state-owned Chinese firm has signed a deal to fund a new aluminum smelter in northwest Iceland. The Chinese Embassy in Reykjavik says bilateral trade, ""though still small in terms of volume, is growing rapidly.'' In the first nine months of 2016, Iceland's imports from China were worth $330 million and its exports $77 million, a year-on-year increase of 12.6 per cent. In an email to The Associated Press, the embassy said China could benefit from Iceland's ""cutting-edge technologies in renewable energy, life-science (and) carbon-fiber industries,'' as well as its fresh fish, meat, dairy products and mineral water. In return, China can provide Iceland with a wide range of Chinese-made goods. Chinese tourists _ whose numbers rose from 26,000 in 2014 to an estimated 60,000 this year_ are helping to drive a tourism boom that has been the saviour of Iceland's economy since the financial crisis. Cozying up to Beijing also gets tiny Iceland noticed by much larger nations. Brady notes that Iceland's politicians have become adept at ""playing the big powers off each other.'' ""They are getting a lot more attention from the United States in recent years because of their perceived very good relationship with China,'' she said. ""And yet what the ordinary people think about that is often quite different from their government. ... the population has some misgivings about this close relationship.'' Those misgivings reached a peak five years ago, when multimillionaire Chinese businessman Huang Nubo tried to buy a 300 square kilometre (120 square mile) chunk of remote northeast Iceland to build an eco-resort. Strong public opposition led the Icelandic government to block the purchase in 2011 _ in part because no foreign buyer had ever bought so much land. Suspicion lingered when the Aurora Observatory was announced for a sparsely populated region 250 miles (400 kilometres) northeast of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik. Pascal Heyman, a former official at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said in 2014 that the Chinese might want to use the equipment to keep an eye on NATO airspace. Iceland is one of the best places in the world to observe the aurora borealis, or northern lights. The colorful phenomenon is caused when a magnetic solar wind slams into the Earth's magnetic field. Scientists hope the observatory will help them learn about the interaction between the sun and the Earth's magnetic field, which could help predict space weather. The observatory is behind schedule _ in part due to a shortage of building contractors in booming Iceland _ but is due to open next fall. It will include a visitors' centre, and local people have begun to capitalize on the upcoming economic opportunities, opening Aurora guesthouses and thermal baths. Reynisson said the initial local skepticism about China's intentions has faded. ""Now you might hear someone say, 'They will never finish it' _ not that they are spying on us or doing something totally different from what is said to be done,'' he said. ""Why build a station here in the valley to spy on us? Much easier to rearrange some of their satellites to spy on us.'' Lawless reported from Reykjavik, Iceland.

Lessons for Ireland in coping with climate change,Iceland,"In Ireland we are already beginning to feel the negative effects of climate change through increased weather variability, and worse is yet to come. However, many other countries at an earlier stage of development than Ireland are facing greater risks of climate-induced damage. One of the most vulnerable of these is Vietnam, where President Michael D Higgins was an official visitor last week. Vietnam's very long coastline and extensive river deltas mean that it will suffer severe effects from a rise in sea level and increased storm frequency as a result of climate change. Vietnam is now classified as ""middle income"" but living standards are still low. As with many rapidly growing countries, it has other very serious environmental problems that are affecting health and living standards. Air pollution Our own Environmental Protection Agency has documented adverse health effects from air pollution in Irish cities. Such air-pollution problems are many times greater in large Vietnamese cities, such as Hanoi, which has a very frequent blanket of smog, and where people routinely wear face masks in the streets. The visible air pollution issue is a real concern for the Vietnamese public, and has greatly raised the priority attached to tackling the country's environmental problems. However, the huge investment needed will be particularly challenging for developing countries such as Vietnam. A conference last week in Hanoi, sponsored by Irish Aid and the Vietnamese National Centre for Socioeconomic Information and Forecast (NCIF), examined the relationship between economic growth, energy demand and emissions of greenhouse gases. Using a model developed by the NCIF, the Economic and Social Research Institute and Trinity College, the research showed that, in coming years in Vietnam, the growth in electricity demand and in transport demand for oil will be much more rapid than the growth in demand for other forms of energy. While, in Ireland, household energy demand for heating is very important, in Vietnam's humid climate, due to get hotter with global warming, rising incomes will see a rapid increase in the use of air conditioning. This will significantly raise demand for electricity. Coinciding with the visit of the President, Irish company Mainstream Renewable Power announced it will invest about €2 billion in building wind farms in Vietnam - making a significant contribution to the development of renewable electricity. If Vietnam is to meet its rapidly growing power needs in a sustainable way, it needs to see huge further investment in renewables. Other research presented to the Hanoi conference looked at how to help agriculture adapt to climate change. Communicating with farmers through television advertising was found to be ineffective, while community meetings worked better to induce people to act. Those farms where women played a big role were also better placed to adapt. This research may hold some lessons for us, though the finding that providing advice via loudspeakers worked well is unlikely to be effective in Ireland. One interesting use of new technology being piloted in Vietnam is the use of mass broadcasts to all mobile phones to warn people in the affected area of impending floods or other natural disasters. Iceland has a similar system to warn all those in an affected area, including tourists from abroad, how to react if a volcano erupts. Emergency text This summer, when visiting family in Minnesota, we received an emergency text with a special warning sound, telling us a flash flood was expected in our immediate area. Fortunately the storm missed us by a few miles. Using data on the geolocation of individual smartphones, such broadcast texts can be a very powerful instrument for providing vital public information on a local basis. Ireland should learn from Vietnam and Iceland and introduce a similar system to warn of impending disasters, such as imminent flooding on the Lee or the Dodder, or a tidal surge in the Shannon. One speaker at the conference in Hanoi spoke about the huge problems Vietnam has with providing a clean water supply and dealing with waste water. He said that, if the necessary investment was to take place, households would need to pay for it through charges. Otherwise the huge problems with water pollution will continue indefinitely with serious health costs. Maybe the Vietnamese are ahead of us on this one."
