ARTISTS TAKE OVER BALTIC SEA DISCUSSION,Denmark,"TALLINN - The Baltic Sea is one of the most fascinating areas in the world, along with its rich|||history. The Baltic Sea area has always been of great importance to the people living around it,|||providing a natural bond as well as route for navigation. Fisheries remain a valuable part of|||people’s livelihood today and the Baltic Sea area is also a recreational resource of growing|||value.|||Because of the very specific hydrographical, chemical and physical conditions of the Sea|||area, and its geological history, it possesses quite unusual fauna and flora. Marine and freshwater|||organisms live side by side, and there is a number of living relicts.|||The exchange of water in|||the Baltic Sea is very slow, and if harmful substances are introduced, they will remain there for a|||very long time. As the fauna and flora of the Baltic Sea area are extremely sensitive to changes in|||their environment, there should be no discharges of harmful substances, especially oil and noxious|||liquid substances, into this vulnerable sea. However, the Baltic Sea is often said to be the|||world’s most polluted sea.|||The health of this body of water has been seriously damaged|||since the 1960s due to excessive pollution from the countries in its catchment area. The pollution,|||such as untreated human waste, toxic materials, and metal, has resulted in the Sea’s|||stratification. This process of stratification has left certain layers of the Baltic mostly|||freshwater, while rendering other layers saltwater. The Baltic Sea, when it is stable, is a mix of|||freshwater from the rivers of Europe, and saltwater from the North Sea which flows in through the|||straits around Denmark. According to experts, the source of much of the pollution was, and still is,|||from the countries of the former Soviet Union and East Bloc. This pollution, in turn, harms a|||variety of other industries, including fishing and tourism.|||Because of unrestricted and|||(environmentally) unregulated industry, factory waste was disposed directly into the Baltic Sea or|||into rivers which fed the Baltic. Experts claim that another reason why the Baltic has reached this|||critical situation is agricultural run-off, all from Western European countries.|||These chemicals|||run off the farmland and into the water supply, eventually ending up in the Baltic Sea. With the|||fall of the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe the issue is now to move towards a|||collective plan to clean up the Baltic. Many positive steps are being taken by the countries which|||either border the Sea, or are in its catchment area.|||The most significant of these steps is the|||Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environment Action Program, which was agreed on and approved by the|||Diplomatic Conference of Ministers of the Environment in Helsinki, Finland in April 1992.|||The|||countries directly effected are the nine which line the Baltic coast: Sweden, Finland, Estonia,|||Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Poland, Germany, and Denmark. The catchment area includes Norway,|||Belarus, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic.|||Experts say that the Baltic|||Sea’s rich biodiversity is threatened by environmental pollution that could cause irreversible|||damage to a sea that is an important source of economic and recreation for more than 80 million|||people who live along its coast and within its catchment area. The sea is very important to the|||tourism and fishing industries of the Baltic countries. Species of fish, such as herring, sprat, and|||cod, are affected by pollution from urban areas, industries, and agriculture (fertilizers). The goal|||of the Baltic nations is to reduce the amount of pollution which reaches the Baltic Sea in order to|||preserve the precious fishing and tourism trade in each country.|||Steps to clean up the Baltic|||have been made possible with the end of the East-West divide. The 14 countries of the catchment area|||are now on schedule to carry out a comprehensive program to improve the environment in and around|||the Baltic Sea.|||Juuka Jormola, a scientist from the Finnish Environment Institute, says|||“Pollution of the Baltic Sea is caused by nutrients, too many nutrients in the water, like|||nitrogen and phosphorus.

"Canada draws a line in the ice; Challenging the image as the peace-loving nation to the north, a new survey finds the majority of Canadians see Arctic sovereignty as the country's top foreign-policy priority and believe that military resources should be shifted to the North from global conflicts. Jill Mahoney reports",Denmark,"When a few dozen Danish tourists erected a cairn with their native flags on hotly contested Hans Island last summer, Prime Minister Stephen Harper sounded a diplomatic note: “Hans Island is a one-kilometre square rock in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, so I'm not sure it would have made for much of a tour.”|||While flag-planting once prompted chest-thumping, Mr. Harper's government has recently embraced diplomatic solutions rather than the “use it or lose it” approach he took four years ago.|||Despite Ottawa's conciliatory approach toward the mineral and fuel-rich Arctic region, however, Canadians have adopted a confrontational stand.|||A new opinion poll finds that Canadians are generally far less receptive to negotiation and compromises on disputes than their American neighbours. More than 40 per cent of Canadians said the country should pursue a firm line in defending its sections of the North, compared to just 10 per cent of Americans.|||The international survey – conducted by EKOS Research for the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto and the Walter & Duncan Gordon Foundation – found that a majority of Canadians see Arctic sovereignty as the country's top foreign-policy priority; they also believe military resources should be shifted to the North, even if it means taking them away from global conflicts.|||The findings are based on a poll of more than 9,000 people in the eight northern countries. Most of those respondents took a more conciliatory approach than Canadians, and favoured Scandinavian nations as negotiation partners over Canada.|||Unlike his Liberal predecessors, Mr. Harper has made the Arctic a major political platform, taking every opportunity to remind Canadians that his government is determined to defend this country's sovereignty in the Far North. The poll's findings would suggest that Canadians have embraced his rhetoric.|||“It is something that allows him to play the nationalism card, particularly since it resonates with the population,” said Brian MacDonald, a senior defence analyst with the Conference of Defence Associations. “There's been a long-term national romance with the Arctic.”|||In addition to Hans Island, which Canada and Denmark both claim, Canada has a border dispute with the United States in the Beaufort Sea, which is believed to hold a trove of natural resources.|||Canada also claims the Northwest Passage as Canadian territory, in contrast to the United States and most other countries who argue that their ships are entitled to “innocent passage” through the Arctic archipelago.|||Last fall, Canada announced it had amassed sufficient scientific evidence to back a claim for the coveted Lomonosov Ridge, of which Russia also asserts ownership.|||The Russians believe the underwater mountain range contains billions of tonnes of fuel deposits.|||With a melting ice cap, tensions over shipping and exploration rights have escalated over the past decade.|||“That reality is leading to and will lead to much more activity in Canada's North and indeed the Arctic everywhere,” said Michael Byers, a University of British Columbia professor and author of Who Owns the Arctic?|||****|||PREFERRED PARTNERS ON ARCTIC ISSUES|||RUSSIA|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred THE U.S.|||SWEDEN|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred|||THE U.S.|||Most preferred CANADA|||Least preferred RUSSIA|||NORTHERN CANADA*|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred CHINA|||SOUTHERN CANADA|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred CHINA|||NORWAY|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred CHINA|||ICELAND|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred CHINA|||FINLAND|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred CHINA|||DENMARK|||Most preferred SCANDANAVIA|||Least preferred CHINA|||*****|||Most Canadians want a military presence (”Which is closest to your point of view?”)|||Security of the Canadian Arctic is extremely important and we should be putting more military resources in that area even if it means putting fewer resources on our military presence in other parts of the world|||*Northern Canadians 59%|||Southern Canadians 56%|||We should not be diverting our military resources away from other countries to increase our presence in the Canadian Arctic|||*Northern Canadians 32%|||Southern Canadians 14%|||Neither one|||*Northern Canadians 3%|||Southern Canadians 22%|||DK/NR|||*Northern Canadians 3%|||Southern Canadians 8%|||Arctic should be the most important focus of our foreign policy|||*Northern Canadians 55%|||Southern Canadians 53%|||We should concentrate on parts of the world beyond the Arctic in our foreign policy|||*Northern Canadians 34%|||Southern Canadians 29%|||DK/Refuse|||*Northern Canadians 11%|||Southern Canadians 18%|||*Northern Canada: Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut|||******|||Canadians are less conciliatory than their Arctic neighbours (”Which is closest to your point of view?”)|||A My country should pursue a firm line in defending its sections of the Arctic|||B It is better to negotiate a compromise with other countries|||C The Arctic should be an international territory like Antarctica|||*Northern Canada|||A 41%|||B 46%|||C 8%|||Southern Canada|||A 43%|||B 46%|||C 8%|||Denmark|||A 5%|||B 64%|||C 24%|||Finland|||A 6%|||B 50%|||C 37%|||Iceland|||A 36%|||B 26%|||C 27%|||Norway|||A 8%|||B 49%|||C 35%|||Russia|||A 34%|||B 33%|||C 14%|||Sweden|||A 5%|||B 35%|||C 48%|||U.S.|||A 10%|||B 30%|||C 25%|||*****|||Contested waters|||Northwest Passage (Canada, United States, European Union)|||A route expected to become a prized shipping channel to Asia and Europe with continued warming.

Arctic sea lane could open by 2035,Denmark,"Commercial ships could be sailing across an ice-free North Pole as soon as 2035, according to US Navy estimates, slashing the time and cost of ocean transportation between Europe and Asia.|||The prediction, by the head of the US Navy's climate change task force, highlighted growing international interest in the commercial opportunities created by shrinking Arctic sea ice.|||""We believe that sometime between 2035 and 2040, there is a pretty good chance that the Arctic Ocean will be essentially ice-free for about a month,"" said US Rear Admiral Dave Titley, at an Arctic conference in Tromsø, Norway.|||He predicted that, as the ice-free period gradually increased, the Bering Strait between the US and Russia would begin to rival the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Malacca between Malaysia and Indonesia as one of the world's most important shipping lanes.|||Climate change sceptics might question such predictions but Mr Titley insists there is no doubt about the long term trend towards reduce ice coverage. Environmentalists caution that any economic benefit from melting ice would be outweighed by the costs of global warming.|||Mariners have long eyed the potential for an Arctic sea route to transform global trade patterns, with the distance between Rotterdam and Yokohama 40 per cent shorter via the North Pole compared with the Suez Canal.|||However, Mr Titley warned that increased co-operation was needed among Arctic nations to build the logistical and rescue capabilities needed to support increased commercial activity in the region.|||Highlighting the risks facing the growing number of cruise liners taking tourists into Arctic waters, he said only luck had so far prevented a ""Titanic-scale disaster"" in the region.|||Addressing the same conference, Össur Skarphéðinsson, Iceland's foreign minister, said his country was attracting interest from China and Singapore as a potential staging post for cargo routed via the Arctic.|||""I'm like a girl at her first dance being flattered by all the attention,"" he joked. ""If you go to the Pacific over the Arctic, Iceland would be a natural place to redistribute cargo.""|||The prospect of easier access to the Arctic has sparked fears of potential conflict between the big five Arctic coastal states - Russia, Canada, the US, Denmark and Norway - over navigation and mineral rights in a region estimated to hold a quarter of the world's undiscovered oil and gas.|||Mr Titley said such concerns were overblown. ""The Arctic is not the wild west … It is an ocean and we understand how to govern oceans.""|||Some non-Arctic countries have suggested the region should be subject to an international treaty similar to the one that governs Antarctica. Such proposals are strongly rejected by the coastal states with territorial claims to Arctic waters.|||""There is no difference in principle between how you deal with the Arctic Ocean and how you deal with the Mediterranean or the Atlantic Ocean,"" said Jonas Gahr Støre, Norwegian foreign minister. ""The South Pole is a big rock surrounded by water. The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by coastal states."""
Arctic countries seek cooperation as ice melts,Denmark,"Top diplomats from eight Arctic countries will meet Thursday to set down rules for opening the vast region to fishing, tourism, oil and mineral exploration as global warming melts the ice.|||US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her colleagues from Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden will gather in Greenland's tiny capital of Nuuk to discuss how to manage the area's development while protecting its fragile ecosystem.|||With its capital of 16,000 people, Greenland will be represented by Denmark, which handles foreign affairs for the sprawling self-ruled territory of 65,000 inhabitants neighboring northeastern Canada.|||Heather Conley, an Arctic expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said the gathering is historic, in part because it is the first time a US secretary of state will attend the ministerial talks.|||It ""is a historic turning point to deepen and strengthen international cooperation in the Arctic as we seek to meet the dramatic challenges of the equivalent of a melting continent over the next several decades,"" she said.|||Clinton's deputy Jim Steinberg said the seventh biennial ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council -- composed of the eight countries and the region's indigenous groups -- also marks another step away from the Cold War.|||""We want to send a strong message that in the post-Cold War world the Arctic is a region of cooperation, not conflict,"" he told a gathering hosted by the CSIS think tank in Washington.|||""By working together to ensure the safety of human life in a newly emerging region of human activity we can show in particular that Russia and the United States are key actors in helping to propel cooperation on core issues.""|||Clinton and her counterparts are due to sign an Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement, which the State Department said will be the first binding international agreement among the eight Arctic states.|||During talks in Iceland in December, the ministers drafted an agreement that divides the Arctic into specific search and rescue areas, with each nation legally responsible for its own territory.|||Icelandic officials said such an agreement was all the more important as an increasing number of people now sail through the Arctic as waterways open up with the melting ice.|||In August last year, a Russian oil tanker set off for China on a previously impassable route through the Arctic Ocean. Cruises with tourists are also venturing into the Arctic, particularly around the US state of Alaska.|||Earlier this month scientists said that warming in the Arctic is occurring at twice the global average and is on track to lift sea levels by up to 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) by 2100, a far steeper jump than predicted a few years ago.|||Steinberg said Washington wants the Nuuk talks to launch a task force designed to negotiate an instrument for handling Arctic oil spills.|||""We know that there are significant deposits of oil and gas that were in the past difficult to access and may become more accessible over time,"" he said.|||The United States wants the Arctic countries to be prepared to both prevent oil spills or other disasters and to create ""effective mechanisms to deal with accidents should they happen,"" Steinberg said.|||More than one fifth of the world's undiscovered but technically recoverable reserves of hydrocarbons are located north of the Arctic Circle, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).|||The region accounts for about 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the undiscovered natural gas, USGS data shows. About 84 percent of the resources are offshore.|||Exploration off Greenland has yet to produce any commercially exploitable reserves, but that did not stop British firm Cairn from boosting its investment there by one billion dollars on the back of ""encouraging"" first results.|||Alaska, where the Prudhoe Bay oil field has been operating since 1977, is currently the most exploited area of the Arctic and its wells are responsible for more than one tenth of US oil production.|||Washington also sees the potential for new fisheries to emerge as the ice retreats, according to David Balton, the US deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries.|||The meeting in Nuuk aims to establish a permanent secretariat for the Arctic Council, with Iceland offering to host it in Reykjavik and Norway proposing its northern city of Tromso, Balton said.|||Clinton, who leaves for Nuuk on Wednesday, will be accompanied by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and other officials, a testament to the importance Washington attaches to the meeting.|||Clinton and the ministers will gather for dinner Wednesday evening.|||lc/jk/ss"

Through icy waters,Denmark,"Ateam of Canadian archaeologists and oceanographers will mount a fresh search next week to solve a great mystery of the British empire: what fate befell the 19th-century expedition led by Sir John Franklin in search of the North-West Passage ?|||When Sir John and his 134-man crew set sail from Greenhithe, England, in 1845, hopes were high that they would open a new trade route between Europe and Asia, returning with a cornucopia of zoological, botanical and geological discoveries. Their instructions were to sail home across the Pacific Ocean.|||But their two ships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, disappeared months later among the maze of islands and sea channels that dot the Canadian Arctic . Neither wreckage nor the men's remains has been found.|||Yet the promise of the Franklin expedition is now being fulfilled in a dramatic way. Global warming is rapidly expanding access to the North-West Passage as well as to other parts of the Arctic region, not only opening trade routes but providing access to a treasure trove of natural resources.|||Louis Fortier, scientific director of ArcticNet, a network of Canadian researchers based at Laval University in Quebec City, says ""things are moving much faster than I expected in the Arctic, whether we're talking about climate warming or industrialisation or the difficulties in the physical and mental health of the Inuit"".|||The transformation of the once inaccessible north is raising tricky strategic, legal and logistical issues, especially for the five nations - Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the US - with jurisdiction over all the Arctic's land and much of its water. Indigenous people of the area also face wrenching economic and social changes to their already threatened traditional way of life.|||According to Michael Byers, international law professor at the University of British Columbia, ""at the moment there's an extraordinary amount of co-operation. That does give me some optimism"". However, Prof Byers adds: ""It is possible that this move towards co-operation could be derailed. From time to time, the politicians of Arctic countries, most notably Russia and Canada, seek to mislead their publics by reaching for old nationalist symbols and sentiments concerning Arctic sovereignty. The contrast between what is said in public and what happens in private is sometimes quite stark.""|||The Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen was the first to succeed where Franklin had failed in threading his way through the North-West Passage. In the first 100 years after Amundsen's 1906 voyage, just 69 vessels followed in his wake. Yet the same number completed the trip in the five years from 2006 to 2010, not counting numerous private mega-yachts that are thought to have followed one of several routes now free of ice during the summer months.|||The long coast of northern Siberia has become even busier. In 2009 Russian authorities began to charge fees on vessels using the northern route to cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific.|||With the ice cap receding , ship operators are now eyeing an even more northerly route across the North Pole that would shave as much as 7,000km off the existing sailing distance between Rotterdam and Tokyo via the Suez Canal. Two German cargo vessels, helped by icebreakers, completed the short polar voyage in 2009.|||Experts caution, however, that even though the top of the world is becoming more accessible, it may be at least two decades before these routes are widely used. Despite global warming, the Arctic remains an inhospitable environment, marked not only by severe cold and months of darkness but far away from search and rescue facilities and other amenities. Icebergs and high insurance costs will also make shipowners think twice.|||Yet such risks have not dampened interest in the Arctic's vast untapped resources. The US Geological Survey, a government agency, estimates 13 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil reserves and almost a third of natural gas deposits lie under the Arctic.|||Several western European energy companies have eyed acquisitions and joint ventures in northern Russia as a way of gaining access to untapped oil and gas reserves. For example, BP acquired a stake this year in Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, which has extensive interests in the region. Elsewhere, a bidding war erupted last winter for a big iron ore deposit being developed south of Pond Inlet on Canada's Baffin Island, about 700km north of the Arctic Circle. ArcelorMittal, the steelmaker, ended up paying $590m for a 70 per cent stake.|||Fish from the Arctic are set to emerge as a huge resource, but also a potential source of friction. Experts predict mass migration of marine life to warming Arctic waters, coupled with the growing shortage of fish elsewhere, will attract trawlers from Japan, South Korea and China, among others.|||""The barriers to commercial fishing are falling pretty rapidly,"" says Scott Highleyman, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' international Arctic programme, based in Bellingham, Washington state. Trawlers could appear around the Chukchi Plateau, north-west of Alaska, within the next five years, he predicts. A Chinese vessel has already conducted marine research in the area. Michel Rocard, a former French prime minister and now the country's ambassador for polar affairs, foresees ""a splendid conflict"" between coastal states and non-Arctic fishing nations.|||The US closed its Arctic waters to industrial fishing in late 2009. Pew, among others, is now urging Canada, Russia and the US to spearhead a multilateral agreement that would limit fishing in international waters, stretching over an area the size of the Mediterranean Sea.|||Such a pact would underline the international collaboration that has so far marked the opening up of the Arctic. ""The Arctic is not a wild west zone,"" Prof Byers says. ""It's not a place of conflict or threat of conflict."" The only land in dispute in the region is a tiny uninhabited island off Greenland claimed by both Denmark and Canada. Prof Byers dismisses this dispute and Russia's much-publicised move in 2007 to plant a flag in the seabed far below the North Pole as ""mostly domestic political noise"".|||Co-operation in managing the region's development took a big step forward in 1996 with the creation of the eight-nation Arctic Council . (Members comprise the five Arctic countries plus Finland, Iceland and Sweden.) According to Mr Rocard, the council ""is the place where Russia co-operates best with the rest of the world"". A reason for its success, Mr Highleyman says, is the inclusion of six indigenous groups from across the region as ""permanent participants"".|||The council agreed this year to set up a permanent secretariat in Tromsø, Norway, and its members signed a binding search and rescue treaty. But as Arctic issues take on a higher profile with more scope for friction, Mr Highleyman says that ""everybody is watching to see whether [the council] changes into a different kind of body"".|||The pursuit of national interest is never far below the surface. Canada, with tacit support from Denmark, has blocked an application by the European Union for permanent observer status on the council because of the EU's stand against seal hunting, a staple of indigenous communities. Norway moved its military command centre last year to Bodø, just inside the Arctic Circle. Russia unveiled plans in June to create two army brigades to defend its polar territory.|||Stephen Harper , Canada's prime minister, has made the Arctic a signature issue since his Conservative party took office in 2006, repeatedly asserting that ""we either use it or lose it"". The Tories' campaign platform in last year's election asserted: "" Canada's north is at the heart of our Canadian identity . . . Our presence in Canada's north is also an increasingly important factor in defending our national sovereignty"".|||A small tent city has sprung up this month near the hamlet of Resolute on Cornwallis Island for Canada's biggest-ever military exercise in the north, involving about 1,200 troops. In a sign of the Arctic's growing accessibility, the operation includes a simulated rescue of passengers stranded on a grounded cruise ship.|||The Arctic nations are also pushing to expand their offshore economic zones beyond the 200-mile limit traditionally recognised under international law. Article 76 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea allows states to claim rights up to 350 miles offshore if the geology of the seabed indicates a ""natural prolongation"" of the continental shelf. Applications are vetted by a group of scientists.|||Norway has already secured an extension, Russia has applied for one and Canada is preparing an application. Mr Byers predicts that some of the claims could overlap.|||The co-operation that has marked Arctic issues so far is also in evidence in next week's search for the remains of the Franklin expedition. Parks Canada, a government agency coordinating the effort, will use an unmanned submarine for the first time, concentrating on an area around Victoria Strait and the west coast of King William Island, about 700km north of the Arctic Circle.|||While the UK theoretically still owns the Erebus and the Terror, it has told Ottawa that if the ships are found, it will lay claim only to any gold bullion on board. It also wants human remains to be treated with appropriate respect.|||As Andrew Pocock, the UK high commissioner in Ottawa, puts it: ""Both sides trust each other to behave in an honest and straightforward manner."" The question is whether that spirit will continue to apply as the dossier of more weighty Arctic issues grows thicker.|||'Worse and more complex than we imagined'|||Michel Bourdeau, captain of the Canadian coastguard ship Amundsen, spotted tourists this month kayaking close to his ship off the coast of Pond Inlet, 800km north of the Arctic Circle. ""You wouldn't have seen that 20 years ago,"" Mr Bourdeau says.|||According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the surface area of the Arctic ice pack shrank to a record low of 7.92m sq km in July, 22 per cent less than the 1979-2000 average and beneath its previous low set in 2007, one of the warmest years on record. A slight recovery in recent weeks has brought it back a little above that level. But the centre warned on Tuesday that ""Arctic ice extent is again declining at a brisk pace . . . With about a month left in the sea ice melt season, the amount of further ice loss will depend mostly on weather patterns.""|||John Smol, a biologist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, uses an everyday metaphor to explain why climate change is wreaking more damage on the Arctic than on just about any other part of the world. Put your hands on a white car and a black car in a parking lot on a summer's day, he says. The black one is hotter because it has a lower albedo, or surface reflectivity, causing it to absorb more of the sun's energy.|||""Arctic lands and oceans, covered in snow and ice, are like the white car - a high albedo and reflecting the sun,"" Mr Smol says. ""Once we start warming the Arctic and start melting the snow and ice it becomes more like the black car. It absorbs even more heat, gets hotter and melts even more snow and ice.""|||Arctic research has grown as the global warming threat has become more apparent. Canada, China, Germany, South Korea, Sweden and the US among others now operate icebreakers devoted mainly to scientific work. The Amundsen, operating in conjunction with ArcticNet, a research network based at Laval University in Quebec City, takes 42 scientists to the Arctic each summer. Its equipment includes a remote-controlled subsea vehicle that can collect samples as far as 2km below the surface.|||Mr Smol says his research suggests that ""things are generally worse and more complicated than we initially imagined"".|||Wetlands in the Arctic that were once carbon sinks have turned into producers of greenhouse gases. Using sediment samples, Mr Smol and his colleagues have tracked a dramatic evaporation of ponds in the high Arctic that were permanent water bodies for thousands of years but are now dry. Higher precipitation has been no match for faster evaporation caused by rising temperatures.|||The warming atmosphere has also triggered a ""grasshopper effect"" transporting toxic substances, such as mercury and pesticides, from the south. Mr Smol has found that even seabirds - of which there are an estimated 10m in the Canadian Arctic alone - have contributed to the pollution by bringing contaminants from the south. Melting glaciers and permafrost are another source of contaminants."
The struggle for Greenland's oil,Denmark,"Downtown Nuuk on a rainy evening in July has the air of a town wanting to be somewhere else. Cars wait patiently at the town's two traffic lights while teenagers on BMX bikes ride aimlessly round the shopping precinct. The temperature hovers around 10C, the leaden skies touched by the faint hue of the midnight sun. It is high summer in the capital of Greenland, 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle.|||On the streets, Inuit traders display their wares in cardboard boxes, selling anything from cut-price DVDs to fur hats. Large Soviet-style apartment blocks loom up behind - reminders of a misguided attempt in the 1950s and 1960s to urbanise the country's population. Towards the old harbour and the rocky fringes of the grassy shoreline, wooden, two-storey houses painted blue, red and yellow are dots of colour in the grey.|||All this could be about to change. About 750km north-west of Nuuk, out to sea, a Scottish company is drilling for oil. Greenland, the world's largest island, with its tiny population of 56,000, is standing on the brink of an oil rush. The potential wealth that lies off its shores is turning the country - an empty wilderness three times the size of Texas - into a battleground. The global oil industry, striving to feed the world's hunger for energy, is engaged in a struggle against environmental groups who believe that this delicate Arctic landscape should remain untouched.|||A spill in such cold waters, they warn, would be calamitous, not least for fishing, currently Greenland's main source of domestic income. But that fear must compete with the hope, shared by some of the biggest players in the energy industry, that the sea floor around Greenland holds one of the world's largest remaining undiscovered oil finds.|||In 2008, a study of the basins of the Arctic by the US Geological Survey estimated that three provinces off the coast of Greenland combined could yield up to 52 billion barrels of oil equivalent (which includes natural gas) - as much as has been drilled out of the North Sea in the past 40 years. This caught the attention of companies including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, and it is why Scotland's Cairn Energy is now prospecting there.|||The numbers also stuck in the mind of Kuupik Kleist, Greenland's prime minister and leader of the country's Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Kleist sees oil as a possible way finally to achieve Greenland's economic independence. Although self-governing since 2009, the country remains a dependency of Denmark.|||Each year the island receives an annual subsidy of about DKK3.2bn (£375m) from Denmark, which helps fund social services. The export of fish brings in revenues of about DKK2bn (£235m). Everything else is imported.|||The irony of Greenland becoming a major producer of hydrocarbons, and contributing to the climate change that is helping to melt its own glaciers, is not lost on Kleist. But the root of the problem, he says, is in the failure of the rest of the world to curb its appetite for energy. ""The western press is focusing on whether Greenland should or should not exploit its natural resources,"" he says. ""They don't focus on the consumption of energy.""|||The country's potential hydrocarbon wealth ""holds a very big economic potential,"" says Kleist. He is sitting at an elegant glass table in his office in the centre of Nuuk. Dressed in an unprepossessing blue T-shirt and jumper - he is about to go on his summer holiday (""hunting and fishing"") - Kleist does not give the impression of a man burdened by what critics describe as a Faustian pact with the oil industry. For him, the argument is clear: the government wants to diversify the economy, and oil and gas present an enormous opportunity.|||Kleist also rejects opinions from abroad about what he regards as Greenland's sovereign prerogative to exploit its resources. ""We claim our right to economic development,"" he says, ""and we claim our right to be independent from former colonial powers.""|||Although oil has not yet been found in commercial quantities, Greenland's government has set up a sovereign wealth fund similar to Norway's. It would hold revenues in trust for the nation. Denmark, Kleist explains, has no claim to any oil revenues. He says he is well aware that rapid wealth can bring risks, especially to a society that has been provided for from the outside for what he describes as ""a very long time and for too long a time"".|||If his vision is clear, the future does not appear quite as straightforward to the country's mostly Inuit inhabitants. Inuits make up some 85 per cent of the population of Greenland - the rest are Danes - and while there appears to be broad local support for the oil industry, particularly its revenues, many are wary of moving too quickly.|||Blowing bubbles for his baby daughter while waiting for the bus, Uusaqqak Kristensen, a 32-year-old school teacher, says the arrival of the energy industry is ""the start of something"" for Greenland. Investment in infrastructure is badly needed.|||Henrik Leth, general manager of the Employers' Association of Greenland, agrees, but he also wants to see new work opportunities for local inhabitants. There is already a sharp disparity between the incomes of Greenlanders and those who come from overseas to work in the Arctic for a year or two. Leth worries that the lack of relevant skills among Greenlanders means they could become mere ""spectators"" amid the oil rush.|||The country's leaders, he says, are seeing ""only the money part of it"" and should force international energy companies to make a lasting investment in the local workforce. The government insists it is doing this. Cairn Energy, for instance, has signed an ""impact benefit agreement"", under which it must invest a certain amount in the local economy. Leth remains cautious: ""If we don't do it right, it's a failure, no matter what happens.""|||. . .|||It is a month earlier, late June, and huddled above the engine room of the Esperanza, a Greenpeace vessel floating some 80 miles off the coast of Greenland, 18 activists are about to embark on ""Operation Foreigner"".|||Frank Hewetson, also known as The Colonel, raises a hand for silence. ""The swell is significant, so I want you to mentally prepare yourselves for the ladders,"" he says. ""Just don't slip.""|||Seventeen volunteers beam back at him, alight with nerves. They are the other face of Greenland's energy rush.|||Among the professional eco-types (unkempt facial hair, socks, sandals) are an anthropologist, a sous-chef and a professional bass guitarist. ""It's a lifelong activist's dream to be on a Greenpeace ship like this,"" says Iris Cheng, an environmental policy co-ordinator from Hong Kong.|||The group - all dressed in orange, body-hugging dry suits - waddle down the Esperanza's port side on a rope ladder. Negotiating the rise and fall of the frigid ocean below, they drop into dinghies.|||Some 15 minutes later a sleepy voice crackles over the Esperanza's radio. It is a policeman from Greenland onboard a battleship charged with maintaining a 500m exclusion zone around the Leiv Eiriksson, one of the exploration rigs hired by Cairn Energy for the summer drilling season. He says the activists - who by this point are climbing the rig's steel legs - are breaking the law. He orders the captain to call them back. Madeleine Habib, the Esperanza's silver-haired captain, politely dismisses the request. ""What do you expect us to do?"" she says. ""Sit around and sing 'Kumbaya'?""|||Officially, the Greenpeace activists are storming the rig to search for Cairn's ""spill response plan"" - a mandatory document that sets out what action an oil company will take in the event of a spill - and which Greenpeace says was initially not being made public by the Greenlandic government.|||The protest, or ""non-violent direct action"" in Greenpeace jargon, is the largest the organisation has staged at sea and part of what it has called ""the defining environmental battle of our age"". For international climate-change campaigners, drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic is the final insult. ""We are drawing a line in the ice,"" says Nick Young, a volunteer and blogger from New Zealand. ""If we see the melting of the ice caps as an opportunity to drill for oil, then what hope is there?""|||A showdown in Greenland is also a welcome fillip for an organisation, which, for the past 15 years, has struggled with fluctuating membership and accusations that on its journey from the fringe to the mainstream it has lost some of its pioneering spirit. The Arctic's melting seascape provides the perfect backdrop for a revival: for many Greenpeace is still associated with its campaigns to protect whales and seals in the 1970s and 1980s.|||""It's a return to our roots,"" says Ben Ayliffe, a senior campaigner for Greenpeace. ""And you have it in an area which tugs on people's heartstrings. They understand its beauty and the threat companies like Cairn pose. It's classic David and Goliath.""|||Not that, financially speaking, Greenpeace is a puny opponent. The group has an annual budget of €206m, out of which it has been able to rent a helicopter for the use of the media to cover its activities in Greenland, and pay the €16,000-a-day necessary to keep the Esperanza and its sister ship, Arctic Sunrise, out at sea.|||The activists' ambition is to take the fight to all corners of the high Arctic. ""We're not just bearded blokes in inflatable boats,"" says John Sauven, Greenpeace's executive director in London. He likens the group's direct action in Greenland to throwing a stone into a pond. ""There's a ripple effect. It makes conversations happen and the risk-factor [for oil companies] climbs dramatically.""|||. . .|||Many of the risks, of course, have always been there. The Arctic oil rush has been a long time coming. Since 1945, more than 10,500 wells, onshore and offshore, have been drilled within the Arctic Circle, with Russia responsible for most of the exploratory wells.|||Greenland granted its first offshore licences as far back as the 1970s. Five wells were drilled, as well as one more in 2000, but none was successful. Interest dried up and the remaining licences were surrendered in 2001. The government came up with a new plan, and the result - a map showing the 20 licences the country has since awarded - is displayed at its Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum in Nuuk.|||Jørn Skov Nielsen, the Danish deputy minister at the bureau, explains what changed. In 2001, the government decided to woo the oil and gas industry by holding more regular licensing rounds and using public money to buy seismic data and to commission environmental impact studies.|||Licence rounds followed in 2002 and 2004. But the real breakthrough came in 2006-2007, when the government offered licences in Greenland's northern Disko-Nuussuaq region, attracting the likes of ExxonMobil, Chevron and Canada's Husky Energy. The lure is now such that last May - as anxiety over the dangers of offshore drilling reached its height during BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill - Greenland received more than 17 applications for its Baffin Bay area. The companies included ConocoPhillips, Shell and Cairn.|||And what is happening in Greenland is only part of the story. The Arctic is hot. BP's proposed alliance with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company that collapsed in May, was about getting the group into the Russian Arctic. Shell is next year hoping to drill exploration wells in Alaska's Beaufort Sea. Statoil, the Norwegian state-controlled group, already has a project in the Barents Sea. Twelve offshore wells have been drilled in the Arctic since 2010.|||The physical challenges are immense. Drilling can only take place in the summer months when the ice has melted. There is little infrastructure and wells are expensive. But today's rush is supported by oil prices of more than $100 a barrel.|||It is no surprise to find Cairn Energy in the race. The company has form: founded by Sir Bill Gammell, a former Scotland rugby international and childhood friend of former US President George W Bush, Cairn struck oil in India at a field where Shell had previously failed to find anything. In 2002, Cairn bought Shell's 50 per cent share in the concession for a mere $7.25m before hitting the jackpot and becoming a FTSE100 company almost over night.|||The three wells Cairn drilled off Greenland last summer failed to find commercial quantities of oil and gas but showed signs of their presence. The programme this summer, which is supported by a fleet of four helicopters, six ice-management vessels to help tow icebergs out of the path of the drilling rigs and two emergency response ships, will cost $600m.|||Earlier this month, Cairn announced its fourth well was also dry but said it remains undeterred. The company insists that despite the high costs, drilling off Greenland will be economical even at lower oil prices. A discovery that yields 500 million barrels would turn a profit from prices of $40 a barrel, they say, while anything from 250 million barrels would make money at $60 a barrel.|||It is a huge exercise in logistics. Every 28 days, the company transports dozens of workers and contractors from its base in Edinburgh to Greenland and then on to its two drilling rigs, the Leiv Eiriksson and the Corcovado. As soon as the workers land in Nuuk, they are given a safety briefing in a hangar that belongs to the airport's fire service. A well-thumbed copy of a thriller, Blowout, about a drilling ship that is sabotaged and then spills millions of gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean, lies on one of the tables.|||Experienced oil workers are in demand in Greenland, and their time is precious. After a cup of tea or coffee, they are searched to make sure they are taking nothing illicit offshore - workers must be teetotal during their stay - and then it is into a survival suit before taking a helicopter to the rig.|||Out in the vastness of the Arctic, the only activity is the never-ending rhythm of the rig's operations. The Greenpeace protest in June was an extremely rare interruption. Simon Thomson, Cairn's CEO, says that he respects the right of the campaigners to express their opinion, but the company objects when ""the way that voicing is expressed potentially compromises safety"".|||As a result, Cairn now has an injunction in a Dutch court against Greenpeace, which forbids activists from disrupting its operations and breaking through the exclusion zone surrounding its ships. More broadly, Thomson insists that Cairn is doing nothing wrong. The company works in strict accordance with Greenland's safety standards, which are modelled on Norway's. It is employing two rigs. In the event of an accident on the seabed, the second rig is on hand to drill a relief well, which would intersect with the damaged well and pump cement down it. The company also has insurance and sufficient funding to deal with any potential incidents, he claims.|||In his Nuuk office, Nielsen, the deputy minister, is equally adamant that Greenland's safety rules are among the toughest in the world and insists much of Cairn's oil spill response plan is public. But Greenpeace can claim to be making an impression. In August, Cairn's plan - whose absence from public view was the official pretext for the protest in June - was published in full by the government. The government said it was able to publish full details after tighter legal restrictions were imposed on how close campaigners can go to the drilling rigs.|||The role of Greenpeace in Greenland remains complicated. Mikkel Myrup, the chairman of Avataq, a local environment group, says that his 50 members have a more nuanced attitude towards the oil industry than international pressure groups. Myrup, who works as a curator at Greenland's National Museum and Archives, says his group is not absolutely opposed to Cairn's drilling, rather that it has sparked ""a different kind of awareness about what this exploration could mean for the environment and marine life"".|||Greenpeace, in particular, makes for an unlikely ally. Myrup credits the group with making ""some good points"" in its campaign against Cairn, but the group is generally disliked in Greenland. Its opposition to the seal trade in the 1980s had a big impact on people's livelihoods. More important, says Myrup, is ""for this young democracy to have a qualified discussion about the issues"".|||. . .|||The sun has finally broken through the clouds and Nuuk shows its brighter side. The centre is bustling with shoppers. Groups of middle-aged tourists just off a cruise ship and dressed in the latest outdoor gear, wander through the streets taking pictures.|||But the debate about Greenland's oil-based future goes on. In his office overlooking the harbour, Alfred Jakobsen, managing director of the country's Organisation of Fishermen and Hunters, is poring over statistics. The organisation has recently commissioned research to compare its fish prices with those of competitors in Canada. Jakobsen says he is against offshore oil development, because ""you cannot control the environmental conditions"" and he worries about what a spill would do to his members' livelihoods. ""We don't know anything,"" he says. ""They send us lots of documents in English. We have to be given a chance to really listen to what this is all about and then consider.""|||Carl Christian Olsen, president of Greenland's Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), the international non-government organisation that represents around 150,000 Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Chukotka (Russia) and Greenland, is more optimistic. He says the government is recognising that it needs to take into account ""the view of the public society"". The ICC, he says, has been focused on emphasising ""a human dimension"" to the debate about drilling in the Arctic, not just the environmental one.|||These are the various conflicting demands that Greenland's new administration must find a way to accommodate. The premier, Kleist, remains pragmatic and he is one of the few who cautions that Greenland's oil dream remains just that. Executives at the major oil companies, meanwhile, are looking forward to the next licensing round, planned for early 2012, for sites off the island's north-east coast, now considered the most promising area.|||Whatever happens, says Kleist, Greenland will play a very significant role in shaping the politics of the Arctic, which, if nothing else, must put the people of the high north at the centre of their changing world. ""Now we are focusing on human beings more strongly,"" he says. ""We always had to yell, 'We are people living the Arctic'.

Fortune which could fund dream of independence,Denmark,"News | The view from Greenland|||One community is gripped by the great Arctic oil rush - the 57,000 people of Greenland, the world's biggest island.|||Officially a self-governing dependency of Denmark, Greenland is increasingly chafing at the reins held in Copenhagen, and just as Scotland once did, is beginning to see the 20bn barrels of oil thought to lie under the seas off its coasts as the fortune that might finance full independence.|||At the moment the Greenlanders, 89 per cent of them Inuit (what used to be called Eskimo) rely almost completely on fishing and tourism to survive, along with an annual grant from Denmark of nearly £400m.|||But they realise that if a company such as Edinburgh's Cairn Energy strikes oil in the wells it is currently drilling in Baffin Bay off the west coast, there will be a new source of income which will completely revolutionise their lives.|||Kuupik Kleist, Greenland's socialist prime minister and leader of the country's Inuit Ataqatigiit party, openly sees the oil as a way not only to diversify the economy, but also to achieve economic independence.|||""We claim our right to economic development,"" Mr Kleist said in an interview last month, ""and we claim our right to be independent from former colonial powers.""|||He is aware of the environmental risks. ""Of course, we are influenced by what happened in the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said. ""We know that we are talking a huge responsibility on our shoulders. But the country is well prepared.""|||Yet although many Greenlanders are welcoming the possibility of oil development, environmental concerns are also present.|||Alfred Jakobsen, managing director of the country's Organisation of Fishermen and Hunters, says he is against offshore oil development, because ""you cannot control the environmental conditions"" and he worries about a spill's affect on his members' livelihoods.|||""We don't know anything,"" he says. ""They send us lots of documents in English. We have to be given a chance to really listen to what this is all about and then consider."""
"The Tell-Tale Art of Tal R: Though the Danish Artist's Technique Has Evolved, His Work Expresses a Continuing Narrative",Denmark,"In a Copenhagen studio cluttered with clay sculptures, endless jars of vibrant pigments, brushes, crayons, pencils and pastels, half-finished canvases and hundreds of art books, the artist Tal R stands in front of a small pot full of rabbit glue. He picks it up and gives the gelatinous substance a stir.|||Dressed in jeans, a plaid shirt and an orange corduroy baseball cap with a small ""H"" -- for Hermes -- embroidered above the brim, Tal R is boyish-looking despite his gray-specked stubble. Earnest and soft-spoken but excitable, he explains the process of heating the glue, adding in pigment and applying the fast-drying mixture to a canvas for a bright, translucent effect. The technique defines ""Science Fiction,"" his latest series of paintings on display in a monthlong exhibition at London gallery Victoria Miro, which opened this week in conjunction with Frieze Art Fair, when the biggest collectors descend on the city.|||Tal R's art -- from his cartoon-like, often sexually explicit drawings that playfully consider the dark and absurd, to the almost child-like collages that mix and match medium and material without convention, to fancifully rendered narrative- and character-rich paintings, full of dramatic color -- have made him a buzzed-about talent over the past decade. It has been a decade in which Tal R has restlessly explored his identity as man and artist -- considering boundaries and belonging, subjectivity and national history, dreams and convention.|||Born in Tel Aviv in 1967, the son of a Danish mother and a Czechoslovakian Jewish father who was a Holocaust survivor, Tal Rosenzweig moved to Denmark as an infant. The name Tal -- a traditional Hebrew name that, unhappily for a school-age boy, is also the word for ""number"" in Danish -- coupled with a surname that was exotic in a small homogenous country, left Tal R often having to explain himself. ""From the beginning, there was this sense of not belonging anywhere,"" says the artist. ""In Denmark, I looked the part but my name was strange. In Israel, my name was right, but with broken-Hebrew and Danish looks, I didn't fit there either. It was this feeling of being caught between two worlds, and in a way it's never gone away.""|||He found expression for those feelings through art, with his initial endeavors beginning while he was attending Carolineskolen, a Jewish grade school in Copenhagen. ""It really started with drawing swastikas in the classroom,"" Tal R says, recalling how he and his fellow students recreated historic scenes. ""From time to time, we'd need to draw them -- on the wings of planes or something -- and I was the one who could get the slant right, the angles perfect.""|||As he grew older, Tal R's drawings evolved into an elaborate class-time habit, an inward escape from history and math. ""For me, drawing was the same as dreaming at night: you don't decide what to dream about, you dream about what you need. In the same way, you don't draw what you are supposed to, you draw what you need and you don't question its function, because no one ever asked you to be able to draw -- it's all yours,"" says the artist, who at 18 dropped out of high-school and enrolled in a private art academy, hoping to further explore the drawings that consumed his day to day.|||But the moment he walked through the art school door, ""Art walked out of me,"" recalls Tal R. ""Art became something entirely different -- you had to follow forms, rules. It was kind of like getting to decide what you dream about, which sounds like a nice idea but it's also somehow claustrophobic, because the wonderful thing about dreams is the natural momentum, the unknowing,"" he says. After two frustrating years, he threw in the towel. Art fell to the wayside and the notion of turning it into a career was replaced by one odd job after the next, one year after the next.|||With encouragement from his family, Tal R began applying to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. After two failed attempts, at 26, he was finally accepted; his submission was a painting of Adolf Hitler, rendered upside down. In his second year, Tal R caught the eye of Anders Kold, a curator at Louisiana, the modern art museum just north of Copenhagen.|||""The weird narrative was initially what drew me to Tal's work,"" Mr. Kold explains. ""The tale-telling about physicality, love, unfulfilled love -- he spoke of a world that was imbued with all the darker sides of what we as human beings strive for and wish to engage with, a world that was beyond the control of the good and orderly mechanisms of civil society. It was about danger, bodily involvement and romance.|||""He could talk about darkness and love together and I saw him as this genuine romantic character,"" Mr. Kold adds. ""But at play was also his background: being born in Israel, but having moved to a Scandinavian model state of welfare and designer furniture -- this mix of a very orderly, happy society and the awareness of his family's past and the dangerous, darker sides of life. He has grappled with that his whole life, and if you look at his iconography, there's always this one world, and then another, whether portrayed literally or more abstractly.""|||Mr. Kold included Tal R's work in a Scandinavian group show at Louisiana in 1997, and soon after, the artist's professional career took off. Nearly 15 years on, those same narrative tendencies persist, even though Tal R's techniques have evolved from drawing to collage and sculpture to painting, the medium Tal R has chosen to call his own, at least for the moment. ""It has always been about subject matter for me -- the things I fear, the things that occupy me. These small themes and thoughts, I can't escape them and it is quite claustrophobic,"" explains Tal R. ""At least with surface, that I can change, that I can control. I can't really control subject matter.""|||""Science Fiction,"" painted over the course of the past year, marks yet another transition. In the series, the artist mixed the rabbit glue with pigments to create a fast-drying mixture that leaves little room for hesitation or revision. For many years, Tal R worked with oil paints, slathering them on the canvas in thick gobs, revising and adding elements, the canvas growing heavier. ""With his new technique, he can't just dabble a bit more paint, or put another canvas on top -- it's do or die,"" Mr. Kold says, adding that the new work reveals Tal R as an artist who has finally begun to come to terms with his talent. ""This is much more mature work, more refined, more assertive. His work has reached a balance now, it's lost that cartoon-like thing. There's obvious mastery in it.""|||Indeed, now 44, with countless international solo shows and commercial success under his belt, it seems Tal R is at ease with both his work and his story. ""It's no longer a discussion about being an artist or not being an artist. It is no longer a relevant personal debate because it is not something I can separate from myself. It really becomes a relationship to the world,"" says Tal R. ""Mentally, what I'm doing is so much drifting and wandering around and, at this point, I have become quite happy being a tourist, not having that sense of belonging. I am deeply rooted in the cross of being here, and not being here.""|||But as he stands in the frame of the large glass door to his studio, bidding goodbye, he looks very much at home, in a space he has chosen to call, according to a sign just to the right of the entryway, nothing short of ""Paradise.""|||License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service[http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=weco20111014000010]"

But after some blatantly biased Chinese refereeing and unashamedly aggressive play by Bayi, it ended in a bench-clearing brawl, with Chinese fans in the Olympic stadium throwing chairs and bottles of water at the Americans.|||Some foreigners in the crowd that hot night in August were tempted to see the melee as nothing less than a metaphor for China's role in the world today: contempt for the rules and fair play, crowned by a resort to brute strength in pursuit of narrow self- interest.|||You certainly don't have to look far for examples of China doing things its own blunt way no matter how much Western sensibilities are offended.|||Just in recent months, Chinese state firms were caught negotiating arms deals with Col. Muammar Qaddafi's besieged regime in defiance of a United Nations embargo, Beijing leaned heavily on South Africa not to give the Dalai Lama the visa he needed to attend Desmond Tutu's 80th birthday party, and Chinese diplomats vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning the deaths of nearly 3,000 civilians at the hands of Syrian troops.|||And that's not to mention the Chinese government's habit at home of locking up lawyers, human rights activists, artists, even Nobel Peace Prize laureates for speaking their minds in ways that would be quite normal in most of the world.|||China's economic rise and its newly amplified voice on the international stage unnerve people and governments across the globe, despite Beijing's best efforts to assuage their fears. Bookstore shelves in America and Europe offer titles such as ""Death by China"" and ""When China Rules the World."" Edward Friedman, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, echoes some other observers when he goes so far as to call China's rise ""the greatest challenge to freedom in the world since World War I"" aimed at ""making the world safe for authoritarianism."" But does China really want to overturn the US-led post-World War II international order - the very system that has allowed the country to flourish so remarkably? And if the men at the top of the Chinese Communist Party are indeed so minded, could they, or those who come after them, ever succeed?|||KUNG FU PANDA AND INNER PEACE|||Ordinary Chinese - from unschooled peasant farmers tending rural rice paddies to get-ahead young computer engineers in Beijing - have been brought up to see their country as benign, and genuinely don't understand how foreigners can see China as a threat. China is the most populous country and the second-biggest economy in the world, they know, but they point out that the average person here makes only 1/10th of what the average American makes. And most of the country is decidedly third-world.|||China is modernizing its military but still finds it a strain to keep a destroyer, a frigate, and a supply ship on international antipirate duty in the Gulf of Aden. Compared with the ability of the United States to fight two major wars and keep six full-scale fleets afloat at the same time, China's military power - even with the world's largest standing army - is puny.|||In general terms, most China watchers in the West agree. What China wants is pretty straightforward and unexceptionable: to be prosperous, secure, and respected.|||""We'd like to be an equal partner on the world stage, and we want the Chinese people to enjoy prosperity,"" says Wu Jianmin, a former ambassador to Paris and now an adviser to the Foreign Ministry. ""For that, international cooperation is indispensable; China is not so arrogant as to say that it's our turn now to run the world our way.""|||Rarely in its history has China looked very hard or long at the rest of the world. Admiral Zheng He led exploratory fleets as far as Africa in the 15th century, but subsequent emperors were content to sit on the throne of the Middle Kingdom, at the center of their universe, and focus on their own lands. China spent a hundred years of submission to Western powers following its defeat in the 19th- century Opium Wars, and it was mired in decades of disruption before and after Mao Zedong's 1949 Communist takeover.|||Only with its newfound wealth has Beijing found itself with a major role on the world stage.|||""It's a very big challenge to restructure our relations with the world while retaining its trust,"" worries Zhu Feng, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University.|||So, as China rises, its leaders are going out of their way to try to reassure the world that their success is, in a favorite official phrase, a ""win-win"" prospect for everybody. So nervous were policy- makers here about upsetting foreigners that they scotched their original formulation of China's future - ""peaceful rise"" - as too threatening. Instead they settled on ""peaceful development.""|||Last month the government issued a 32-page white paper full of comforting words explaining what it wants the world to understand by that phrase.|||""There have been misunderstandings about China's foreign policy,"" said Wang Yajun, the Communist Party's top foreign-policy wonk, presenting the document to the press. ""There have indeed been suspicions.""|||The white paper's key message is that China threatens no one, that its rise will contribute to world peace, and that ""the central goal of China's diplomacy is to create a peaceful and stable international environment for its development. China could become strong in the future. Yet peace will remain critical for its development, and China has no reason to deviate from the path of peaceful development.""|||""China does not want to, nor will China, challenge the international order or challenge other countries,"" insisted Mr. Wang, pointing to the white paper declaration that China has ""broken away from the traditional pattern where a rising power was bound to seek hegemony.""|||Not everyone believes this, even in China. ""Humanity is making progress,"" argues Wang Xiaodong, a prominent nationalist ideologue whose views are proving increasingly influential among the Chinese public, ""but not so much that China will be unique in human history. The idea that China will develop its power but not use it is diplomatic verbiage.""|||China's Southeast Asian neighbors might well agree. Until earlier this year Beijing had been unusually assertive in pushing its competing territorial claims in the South China Sea, worrying smaller nations. But the way it has eased off in recent months in the face of complaints suggests it cannot do just as it likes.|||""China tests the water constantly, and when they don't get what they want they tend to back down,"" says Bonnie Glaser, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""As they develop their military capacities, they have to be very careful not to use them in ways that scare the neighbors.""|||The Chinese government's need to explain itself stems partly from the system's chronic secrecy: Outsiders do not even know when the ruling Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Politburo meets, let alone how its nine members reach decisions or what those decisions are.|||At the same time, some observers suggest, there is not always a coherent answer to the question of why China does what it does. The Chinese government is not a monolithic force; pressure groups and cliques from the military to provincial governments have their own interests and can sometimes push aspects of foreign policy their way.|||""They don't have a clear and well-defined road map of how to achieve their goals long term other than to pursue development as they have done,"" says Michael Swaine, a China watcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.|||Nor, frankly, do foreign affairs seem to figure very high on Chinese leaders' agendas. ""International questions are an afterthought,"" says Francois Godement, founder of the Asia Centre, a Paris-based think tank.

Those who attended said they weren't surprised that no Chinese company had sent a delegate; the Chinese rarely mix with their mining colleagues, they explain.|||But a visit to a local casino, heavily protected behind high, razor wire-topped walls, is evidence enough that the Chinese are indeed in town, and with money to spend: The clientele in the smoky, air-conditioned chill is almost exclusively Chinese - crowded at roulette tables and playing blackjack and poker, with mounds of chips in front of them.|||These men are part of a growing Chinese presence in Congo that has already flexed some impressive economic muscle. Chinese companies are behind two billion-dollar deals, now in the works, to buy two large copper mines near Lubumbashi. Across the African continent, others like them are engaged in China's most dramatic drive for friends abroad, seeking to secure the oil, minerals, and other raw materials that China's still-booming economy needs.|||""China's financial support on the continent gives African countries a choice"" between East and West, says one Chinese activist at a nongovernmental organization following Beijing's African adventure, who asked not to be identified.|||China's financial muscle has been key to its growing influence in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Beijing signed a $6 billion minerals-for-infrastructure deal in 2009. Congo's traditional Western partners don't have the ready cash for the mammoth task of rebuilding the war-ravaged country, says Congo's communications minister, Lambert Mende, so ""China is very important.""|||In return for 10 million tons of copper and 600,000 tons of cobalt, China will build roads, schools, hydroelectric dams, and hospitals. Half the deal is a barter, which means that it adds less to the country's foreign debt burden.|||""Whether [the deal] will prove to be more effective than the Western model in the long term remains to be seen,"" says Lizzie Parsons of the Global Witness pressure group. Among unanswered questions: whether money will be siphoned off corruptly, whether all the infrastructure will be built, and what impact fluctuating mineral prices will have on the deal.|||Orange construction vehicles from China are already a common sight at roadworks all over the capital, Kinshasa, and more and more people are doing business with Chinese firms.

""You are rarely happy at the end of negotiations. They don't show respect or politeness, and there is no feeling,"" he complains, adding that he rarely builds with Chinese clients the sort of personal relations he enjoys with Congolese or Western businessmen.|||The Chinese are sharp, though, and Congo's traditional Western partners feel a little threatened by them, especially in light of Chinese firms' close relationship with the Congolese government, acknowledges the Western businessman.|||""We are aware of their strength,"" he says. ""They are protected; they can drive a car with no plates and no one stops them. You try doing that and see what happens.""|||Another country keen to keep the China card up its sleeve, especially as its relations with Washington turn sour, is Pakistan, whose leaders have recently been trumpeting the two neighbors' ""all weather friendship.""|||China's efficient work on the ground in Pakistan (see related story on page 29) has earned it a warm welcome: A Pew survey last year found 85 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable view of China, versus only 17 percent who were similarly disposed toward America, Pakistan's major donor.|||Pakistanis remember that China has provided arms when Washington refused them in the past, but Beijing appears reluctant to involve itself too deeply in security affairs today: Business is good, and Pakistan is a big market for Chinese electronics, motorbikes, toys, and food, but China's leaders seem cautious about committing too deeply to Islamabad, say ob-servers in Beijing.|||On the other side of the world, in Brazil, it's a similar story. China overtook the US as Brazil's largest trade partner in 2009 on the back of huge purchases of oil, soybeans, and iron ore; Brazilian exports to China grew 18-fold between 2000 and 2009.|||But ""our relationship with China is one of almost only commerce and investment,"" says Roberto Abdenur, a former Brazilian ambassador to both Beijing and Washington.|||""With the United States it's cultural and political - the two countries share many interests that China doesn't,"" such as the promotion of human rights, democracy, and transparent governance, he adds.|||Indeed, for a government that says it is generally content with the current world order, Beijing is on unusually good terms with regimes cast out by that order, such as those ruling Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Burma (Myanmar), and Zimbabwe.|||""By making friends with dictators, China challenges the [global] democratic system and works at cross purposes to the international mainstream,"" complains Mao Yushi, a well-known reformer who has mentored many of China's leading economists.|||This does not inspire confidence in Western capitals but is less of an issue in developing countries, whose own experience with Western governments - under their rule or trading with them - has often left them feeling seriously hard done by.|||China has fewer opportunities to exert international political influence commensurate with its economic clout. That's partly because few governments around the world, and even fewer electorates, regard China's repressive, authoritarian one-party system as a model to be admired or imitated, regardless of its economic achievements.|||Though China's readiness ""to voice different opinions from the only country in the world that has had a say up until now ... is attractive to other nations,"" says Gong Wenxiang, a professor at Peking University's Journalism School. ""I can't see people being happy with a very strong power often supporting dictators. That is not a positive image.""|||""China is a power in terms of its resources, but it's not a power in terms of its appeal,"" adds David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy program at George Washington University. Deficient in soft power, ""it's not a model, not a magnet others want to follow.""|||Nor does Beijing show much sign at the moment of seeking to push any particular model of governance or political mind-set, which is music to the ears of men like Mr. Mende, the Congolese communications minister. ""We don't believe in that trend of Western powers mixing with internal affairs of countries,"" he says. ""We don't like people giving us orders. China is more about respecting the self-determination of their partner.""|||That hands-off approach also steers the country clear of alliances that might enmesh Beijing in the costly defense of other people's interests. Even those Pakistani officials who would like to play Beijing off against Washington recall that not once has Beijing stepped in to help Pakistan in any of its wars with India, all of which Pakistan lost.|||""China wants to make the deals but not to shoulder responsibilities,"" says Zhu, the Peking University international relations scholar. ""We are far from ready, psychologically, to make ourselves a dependable power.""|||The government's recent white paper acknowledged as much: ""For China, the most populous developing country, to run itself well is the most important fulfillment of its international responsibility.""|||Recent events in Libya illustrate how far China is from playing a creative international diplomatic role. Throughout the crisis, Beijing was a passive, reactive bystander, going along with Western intervention. But, focused on protecting its oil interests above all else, it was the last major power to recognize the new Libyan government. That cautious attitude was on display again last week in China's reluctance to contribute as heavily to the eurozone's bailout fund as European leaders had hoped it would. China was not, after all, going to save the world.|||""China's diplomacy is cost-benefit-oriented, not dealing in terms of global public goods,"" argues Professor Shambaugh. ""It's a very self-interested country, looking after themselves.""|||One result of that attitude? ""China is rising, but we are a lonely rising power,"" says Zhu. ""The US has alliances; no one is an ally of China's.""|||NEIGHBORS SAY, 'NEVER'|||Vietnam was once an ally, when Hanoi was fighting the Americans, but not any longer.|||""Jamais,"" read T-shirts that Vietnamese protesters donned last month, ""Never."" The slogan recalled Ho Chi Minh's forceful response when he was asked by a French interviewer whether Vietnam would become a Chinese satellite after the war. It still expresses the popular, centuries-old anti-Chinese feeling that runs deeper than any shared allegiance to communism.|||The demonstrators were protesting the aggressive way they said China is pushing its claim to the Spratly Islands, a cluster of rocks in the South China Sea that Vietnam also claims. Both countries are eyeing oil and gas reserves under surrounding seas. Chinese naval vessels have arrested more than 1,000 Vietnamese fishermen in disputed waters this year, according to the Hanoi fisheries authorities.|||China is embroiled in similar territorial disputes in the South China Sea with several other regional powers, and they all sent their defense ministers to Tokyo last month to discuss ways of deepening their cooperation.|||""China's aspirations to be a regional leader are meeting resistance from other states already,"" says Hugh White, a former Australian defense official. ""Beijing would like to exercise a soft, consensual leadership, but they won't be able to achieve it"" because none of China's neighbors would accept it.|||China's key local priority abroad is to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence and to eventually unite the island with the mainland. But Beijing's escalation of its territorial claims to almost the whole of the South China Sea and its rapid modernization of a navy to enforce those claims alarm Washington's and China's neighbors. Fifty percent of world trade is shipped through those waters.|||""China's one overriding focus is to challenge US ability to project its power in the western Pacific,"" says Mr. White. ""They want to be able to sink American aircraft carriers.""|||According to senior US naval officers, China may soon be able to do just that, using its new antiship ballistic missiles to enforce ""anti-access and area denial"" close to Chinese waters. Using such weapons as part of a defensive strategy, ""China can reduce US strategic options very significantly,"" warns White, should Washington ever want to come to the aid of Taiwan or other allies in Southeast Asia.|||That puts China's neighbors in an awkward position. All of them, from Japan to Laos, know that their economic future depends on China, Asia's powerhouse. China's success will be their success. But for centuries, countries such as Vietnam and Korea lived under the yoke of a successful China, points out Linda Jakobson, a researcher at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, ""and nobody in the region wants to go back to that,""|||PROFIT MOTIVE OR GEOPOLITICAL MOTIVE?|||If China's political leaders know that they still lack what it takes to play a decisive role in world affairs, Chinese business titans are even more aware of their limitations.|||""There is a perception that China is buying up the world,"" says Andre Loesskrug-Pietri, a Franco-German businessman whose private equity company in Beijing helps Chinese firms make foreign acquisitions. ""But it's not true.""|||Chinese overseas investment is growing by leaps and bounds, doubling annually, and high-profile deals such as Lenovo's purchase of IBM's personal computer division grab headlines. But China's total foreign direct investment remains low - about the same as Denmark's (1 percent of the global total compared with the 22 percent US share). And 60 percent of overseas deals are for resources, such as stakes in oil-shale fields in Canada, coal mines in Australia, gas fields in Argentina, and copper mines in Zambia.|||Very few Chinese firms have the skills and experience needed to become competitive multinationals, says Thilo Hanemann of the Rhodium Group in New York and author of a recent study of Chinese foreign investment. ""What corporate China is doing at the moment is catching up,"" he explains. ""Chinese companies are disadvantaged in technology, staff, human resources, brands, and intangible value.""|||They also have to learn new ways of doing business, very different from their habits in China, where the key to success is often a close relationship with the government officials who can offer easy credit and light regulation - for a consideration.|||""The longer I live here, the more relaxed I am about the so- called threat perceived in the West of China taking over the world,"" says Mr. Loesskrug-Pietri. ""Many Chinese investors are unfamiliar with foreign business cultures, and we are still a long way away from seeing executives and companies that are truly global.""|||Not one of the Top 100 global brands ranked by Businessweek magazine and the consulting company Interbrand comes from China. Though 61 of the top Fortune 500 companies are Chinese, hardly any have any foreign directors; most are state-owned companies whose leaders are named by the Communist Party. And most of the Chinese companies going abroad are doing so, says Loesskrug-Pietri, to acquire what they need in order to compete better in the market they find most attractive - China.|||A handful of Chinese firms are developing a genuinely global presence: Lenovo is one; Huawei, a telecom-networking firm selling its products in 140 countries, is another; Haier has begun to sell a significant number of its household appliances in America and Europe, as well as in Asia. And the larger, reputable private companies stretching themselves internationally tend to get high marks from their foreign partners.|||""I've been very impressed,"" says Henri Giscard d'Estaing, chief executive officer of Club Med. The French tourist resort owner sold a 10 percent stake to Fosun, a Chinese conglomerate, earlier this year. ""They behave like normal long-term share-holders; they've concluded that we know our business and they let us get on with it. Doing business with Fosun has been more banal and more basic than most people would think"" business with a Chinese firm would be, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing adds.|||Where some critics of Chinese foreign investment ""perceive state motives, or some kind of geopolitical motivation ...

They know they don't know how things work, and they are cautious about messing up existing operations,"" says Loesskrug-Pietri.|||Some of them also have good reason to be nervous about the reaction they might provoke. ""As Chinese companies go global they encounter so many suspicions,"" complains Wu. ""This is not a good sign.""|||The private company Huawei, for example, in the past three years, has been blocked three times on national security grounds from doing deals in America, after critics claimed the company has links with the Chinese military. Huawei has always denied that, but only after the third setback did the firm disclose its ownership structure and board membership in a bid to be more transparent.|||Even when that kind of secrecy is not a problem, Chinese investors abroad are running into increasingly open anti-Chinese sentiment. In Brazil, where local manufacturers claim that cheap Chinese imports of everything from toys to cars to industrial machinery have cost the Brazilian economy 70,000 jobs, the government recently slapped a protectionist tax on foreign vehicles aimed at the Chinese-made Chery, the cheapest fully accessorized car on the market at $13,600.|||And as Chinese investors express interest in Brazilian farmland, parliament is debating a law that would allow Americans and Europeans to buy land, but not Chinese.|||In Zambia, where Chinese investments in copper mines top $2 billion but where Chinese employers have made a bad name for themselves, the presidential election this month was won by Michael Sata, who has made his career out of China-bashing. Even in Burma, one of China's closest friends in Asia, the government last month suspended a controversial Chinese dam project amid a rising wave of popular resentment against an overwhelming Chinese business presence in the country.|||A SHALLOW - NOT SUPER - POWER|||""China really has to know how to navigate these stormy waters,"" warns Zhu. ""The West overreacts a bit to our rise, but we have to pay more attention to the fact that we are the ones causing the disturbance.""|||""We are newcomers, and people are usually suspicious of newcomers,"" says Wu. ""They also have a lot of suspicions about the Communist Party, which creates an ideological barrier. But if our actions match our words, over time we can build trust.""|||China is a ""shallow power"" for the time being, argues Shambaugh.

Santa Claus may see you when y,Denmark,"Policy analyst Heather A. Conley says the battle over Santa's back yard is heating up as the U.S., Russia and others vie for control of the melting ice caps|||Santa Claus may see you when you're sleeping, but NORAD makes sure it sees Santa pretty much round-the-clock. The North American Aerospace Defense Command not only follows Saint Nick's sleigh ride with its famous NORAD Tracks Santa site, but it is also involved in a struggle over resources, border control and broader military presence right in Santa's vast and magnificent home: the Arctic.|||In April, President Obama signed a new command plan that gives NORAD and the U.S. Northern Command greater responsibility in protecting the North Pole and U.S. Arctic territory.|||The Arctic region - covering more than 30 million square kilometers and stretching around the territorial borders of Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United States by way of the Alaskan coastline - is transforming before our eyes. And not just because the ice is melting. It's increasingly the site of military posturing, and the United States isn't keeping up with the rest of the world.|||In 2009, Norway moved its operational command to its northern territories above the Arctic Circle. Russia has plans to establish a brigade that is specially equipped and prepared for military warfare in Arctic conditions. Denmark has made it a strategic priority to form an Arctic Command. Canada is set to revitalize its Arctic fleet, including spending $33 billion to build 28 vessels over the next 30 years. Even China has entered the Arctic race; it constructed the world's largest non-nuclear icebreaker to conduct scientific research in the Arctic.|||September marked the lowest recorded levels of sea ice in the Northern Polar Region. The polar ice cap today is 40 percent smaller than it was in 1979, and in the summer of 2007 alone, 1 million more square miles of ice beyond the average melted, uncovering an area of open water six times the size of California. As quickly as the polar ice cap recedes, commercial opportunities in the resource-rich Arctic advance. The Arctic is governed by the U.N. convention on the Law of the Sea. That framework allows a coastal state to have exclusive economic control 200 miles off its coast - and possibly to extend authority 600 miles beyond, depending on certain scientific claims.|||In the 21st-century Arctic, large corporations and countries are racing to reach and capture the abundance of offshore oil and gas as well as iron ore, nickel, cooper, palladium and rare-earth minerals. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the Arctic contains 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil resources and 30 percent of its gas resources. And as the ice melts, cargo transport could increase from the 111,000 tons in 2010 to more than 1 million tons in 2012, according to some Russian estimates.|||It's not just a natural-resources race. Cruise ships take eco-tourists to see the North Pole, stunning Arctic coastline vistas and endangered species such as beluga whales and polar bears - for $24,000 to $35,000 a head. In addition, international scientists search for climate-change clues in Arctic permafrost conditions, ice dynamics and glaciers. Fishing trawlers hunt for lucrative fish stocks.|||The Arctic has always been a grounds for competition, both over and under the ice. In the early 20th century, it was a race of great explorers and visionaries. The Canadian American Arctic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson, known as the ""prophet of the North,"" had the foresight to understand the Arctic's strategic importance and economic potential despite a disastrous expedition. During World War II, the United States rushed to develop supply routes by air and by sea. The country needed to reach the Soviet front and fight off any possible Japanese invasion of Alaska. The Cold War Arctic meant racing to defend against and deter Soviet ballistic nuclear submarines, stealthily patrolling under the Arctic ice, and Soviet strategic bombers flying over it.|||U.S. security interests in the Arctic today are a dim reflection of that bipolar Cold War era. Yet much of the security infrastructure remaining in Alaska, rusted and largely abandoned, was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s. In the Arctic, the United States has had trouble updating its strategy. The most definitive declaration of U.S. policy toward the Arctic is a presidential directive, signed by President George W. Bush in January 2009. Following an extensive interagency effort, the directive outlines some of the most pressing U.S. security interests in the region: missile defense and early-warning systems; strategic deterrence and maritime security operations; maintaining freedom of navigation; and preventing terrorist attacks. It also addresses governance of the internationally controlled region, scientific cooperation, environmental issues and economic developments.|||But the U.S. strategies and policy statements about the Arctic are poor substitutes for action in the Arctic. And that's where the United States falls flat. The Coast Guard has no operating bases or stations above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. That means that any search-and-rescue or maritime deployment in the U.S. Arctic Sea is delayed by at least eight hours by air and days by sea. Today, the United States has only one medium-duty operational icebreaker in commission, the Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The Coast Guard's entire inventory of such vessels includes two heavy icebreakers, Polar Sea and Polar Star, both of which are not operational. The future of this fleet is in Congress's hands, where the House and Senate are wrangling over funding decisions.|||The security cost of the limited capability of the United States in the Arctic became clear this month. Officials in Nome, Alaska, needed a Russian tanker to deliver an emergency shipment of fuel when the city was blocked by sea ice, shifted by a strong winter storm. To escort the tanker, the Coast Guard ship Healy had to be diverted from a scientific mission. It is scheduled to break an ice channel for the tanker once the Russian vessel is cleared to enter the Alaskan port and will facilitate the tanker's return to open water.|||This past summer, Sweden decided to recall its icebreaker, which was leased to the U.S. government, leaving the United States unable to reach and resupply its scientific station in the other polar region, the Antarctic. Alaskan Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell (R) recently told Congress that ""without action, America is putting its national security on the line, and we are going to miss the opportunities of the Arctic while watching other nations advance.""|||Treadwell isn't just being alarmist. Five years ago, Russia fired cruise missiles over the Arctic in a summer military exercise, resumed surface naval patrols in Arctic waters in 2008, reinforced its strategic nuclear forces in the North, and is currently building eight ballistic missile submarines planned to be completed by 2015. Last year, two Russian strategic bombers carried out a routine patrol mission over the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and were shadowed by a large number of NATO jet fighters, the first time in recent memory that such a large NATO response occurred.|||The 21st-century Arctic will require strong coordination among the Arctic coastal states, other nations in close proximity to the Arctic such as Sweden, Iceland and Finland, and Arctic indigenous populations. That is why those countries created the Arctic Council in 1996 to support international cooperation on environmental protection and sustainable development. However, the council's mandate forbids it to discuss military or security matters. Although four out of the five coastal states are members of NATO, that is the last organization that Russia would like to see enhance its presence in the Arctic. Yet the longer there is an ad-hoc approach to Arctic security, the greater the risk of misunderstandings, miscommunications and accidents in this dark, ice-covered and hostile region.|||An Inuit proverb suggests that ""only when the ice breaks will you truly know who is your friend and who is your enemy."" The United States will find out who its allies and rivals will be in the Arctic sooner rather than later. Fifty years ago, securing and controlling the Arctic was a national imperative. In the 21st-century Arctic, the challenges are just as relevant and real, although quite different from preventing a Japanese invasion or stopping a Soviet missile. And the United States needs to act before the opportunity, like the ice, melts away.|||Heather A. Conley is the director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former deputy assistant secretary of state.

Iqaluit: Gateway to the riches of Greenland,Denmark,"Air Greenland isn't exactly among the world's major airlines. It only has 10 airplanes, 600 employees and one international route – to Iceland.|||But when the airline announced Wednesday that it's starting regular flights from Nuuk to Iqaluit this summer, many in the global mining community took notice. That's because Greenland has become one of the hottest places in the world for mining and oil exploration.|||Global warming, new extraction technologies and a recent move by Denmark to give the island territory autonomy over natural resources has prompted a stampede of companies rushing to Greenland to tap its uranium, iron ore, gold, gemstones, rare earths and offshore oil.|||“Over the past few years, we've just seen a growing demand for this service,” Christian Keldsen, an Air Greenland spokesman said from Nuuk. “There is a lot of exploration going on.”|||Iqaluit made sense as the launching point for North America, he added, because it's relatively close to Greenland and shares cultural and educational ties with Nuuk. There used to be flights between the two communities back in the 1990s, but they were not sustainable, Mr. Keldsen said. Now, with all the exploration and mining activity under way in Greenland, Air Greenland saw an opportunity – especially since many companies have been chartering aircraft to make the trip.|||The Dash-8 service will be co-ordinated with arrivals in Iqaluit from Ottawa and other Canadian cities to ensure smooth connections for business people. For now, the flight, which takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes, will run twice a week from June to September and cost about $1,500 return. Air Greenland is considering extending the service later into the year and adding more cities.|||“I think it's marvellous,” said Nicholas Houghton, chief executive officer of Vancouver-based True North Gems Inc.,|||which is developing a ruby mine in Greenland. “It shows they are open for business.”|||Mr. Houghton travels to Greenland up to four times a year and he usually has to fly through Amsterdam and Copenhagen, which can take more than two days. He has also hired planes in Iqaluit to make the trip.|||True North has been working in Greenland for the past eight years and Mr. Houghton said the level of activity has been growing steadily. He noted that Greenland shares much of the same geology as Northern Canada but isn't nearly as cold in winter. “We were there last year at this time and it was minus 5,” he said. Greenland, he added, “is an untapped resource.”|||Greenland is the world's largest island (Australia is considered a continent) and while it is almost entirely covered in ice, new mining technologies and warming temperatures have made more projects feasible. Britain's Angel Mining PLC is starting a gold mine and has reopened an abandoned lead and zinc mine. London Mining PLC, also of Britain, is working on an iron ore mine. Canada's Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. is considering a molybdenum project and Hudson Resources Inc. is focusing on rare earths minerals and diamonds. Britain's Cairn Energy PLC is also drilling for oil offshore and China has taken an interest in Greenland, with many Chinese companies considering partnerships on the island.|||The number of mineral licences issued in Greenland has increased from 17 in 2002 to nearly 100 last year, according to figures from the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum. Many more licences for prospecting have also been awarded and overall exploration activity has increased from about $3.1-million 10 years ago to nearly $100-million today.|||“Development is the prime driver for this [air service],” Iqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern said. Ms. Redfern said the flights will also create opportunities for increased trade, tourism and cultural exchanges between Iqaluit and Nuuk. There have been attempts to start several joint projects between the cities, she added, but they have been hampered by the difficulty of just getting to each city. Travelling to Nuuk costs a fortune at the moment and requires going through Ottawa and Europe. Five months from now, it will take less than two hours at a price less than it costs just to get to Ottawa.|||“This is very exciting for us,” Ms. Redfern said."

Left out in the cold?; Canada a laggard in global race for Arctic resources,Denmark,"The five hotels of the Northwest Territories town of Norman Wells (population: 800) saw more than their fair share of hard hats last year.|||""You could not get a room there for six months last winter,"" said David Ramsay, Northwest Territories' minister of transportation industry, tourism and investment. ""Grocery stores saw a 100% increase in sales; it was unprecedented economic activity for that period of time - we are going to see even more this coming winter.""|||Norman Wells is not alone in witnessing this bonanza. Towns and communities across the vast Arctic landscape are waking up to the riches that lie buried beneath, as oil executives scope for prospects and Arctic governments take another 'strategic' look at the region's hydrocarbon and mineral riches.|||The area shared by Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States offers an estimated 46 trillion cubic metres of undiscovered global natural gas, or 30% of the global total. In addition, it holds 90 billion barrels of oil - or 13% of the estimated global total of undiscovered oil, according to a 2008 U.S. Geological Survey.|||While the Arctic's resource potential has been known for decades, the North Pole has historically presented a daunting logistical challenge.|||Until now.|||In what may be described as an environmentalist's worst nightmare, global warming and melting ice in the Arctic are rewarding oil companies with access to its thawing oil, gas and mineral deposits through greater shipping access. But that's just part of the equation.|||""Climate change has reduced the barrier to entry - it is definitely an enabling factor,"" says Charles Emmerson, who wrote The Future History of the Arctic and is a senior research fellow at London-based Chatham House. He believes the entire Arctic area could see investments of more than $100-billion over the next decade, primarily in oil and gas, mining and shipping. ""Other key drivers include improved technology. Secondly, the cost of producing the fields may be less than before, and more importantly, the price for oil is right - not so much for gas.""|||Big Oil is also running out of places to drill. With stateowned enterprises shutting off oil majors in much of the Middle East and Latin America, the Arctic presents itself as a meltingly tempting prospect.|||But Canada may have to wait a little while longer, as oil majors focus on other opportunities. Moscow, Oslo and Washington already have Arctic projects underway and have drawn up far more advanced plans to exploit the region, potentially leaving Ottawa behind in the global (sled) race for Arctic resources.|||""When I look at Canadian Arctic energy exploration, I see a litany of missed opportunities in the past,"" says Mr. Emmerson, who argues that mineral mining offers a better medium-term prospect in the Canadian North than hydrocarbons. ""But that's not necessarily such a bad thing. There are all kinds of environmental consequences of drilling for oil and gas. Canadian Arctic is one of the most remote parts of the Arctic. So if something were to go wrong, it would be incredibly hard to deal with.""|||Of course, Ottawa already has enough energy environmental concerns to deal with in the Alberta oil sands, and may not have the political appetite to take on environmentalists who are ramping up their global campaign against Arctic development.|||Which puts N.W.T. and Nunavut in a bind as the federal government controls sale of land and resources in the two Arctic territories. The premiers of the Yukon, N.W.T. and Nunavut met this month and pushed for greater say in the country energy's policy and on the intergovernmental Arctic Council - an association of coastal states and other interested parties that periodically discuss security, environment emergency response and development.|||Mr. Ramsay hopes the N.W.T. government will wrap up devolution negotations with Ottawa by 2014 and fasttrack its energy plans.|||By that time natural gas prices may have rebounded from their decade low, making N.W.T.'s centrepiece $16billion Mackenzie Gas Project feasible. The pipeline, which was stuck in Canada's regulatory quagmire for nine years, has now been shelved due to poor economic feasibility.|||The Mackenzie Gas project is not the only one up N.W.T.'s sleeves, with a total of 81 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 7 billion barrels of oil ""waiting to be taken,"" according to the minister.|||Husky Energy Inc. is building a 36-kilometre all-weather road between Norman Wells and Tulita, while Chevron Corp. is planning seismic exploration in the area this year. The government also recently sold two parcels north of Norman Wells, generating $92million in work commitment. Overall, the industry has committed close to $630-million of exploration over the next four to five years.|||But for now, the gas remains buried.|||With lower Canada and the United States awash in oil and shale gas, the idea of laying a gas pipeline through some of the underdeveloped Arctic plains may not be appealing, especially at $2 per British thermal unit of gas.|||Nunavut, which is estimated to hold a quarter of Canada's conventional oil reserves, is much further behind the N.W.T. in its devolution discussions with Ottawa. But negotiations have finally begun, said Peter Taptuna, Nunavut's minister of economic development and transportation, who has noted rising interest in lands along the southern reaches of the Sverdrup Basin, estimated to hold 500 million barrels of oil and 27 tcf of gas. ""In the next few years we may see renewed exploration occurring there,"" Mr. Taptuna said.|||Promising exploratory drilling in West Greenland waters has also led to considerable interest in the Canadian side of Baffin Bay. The federal government has begun research and the area could see a 'call for nominations' within a few years, Mr. Taptuna says.|||In the eastern Arctic, offshore of Baffin Island, estimates place the oil potential in the range of 10 billion to 30 billion barrels.

"Arctic wilderness faces pollution threats as oil and gas giants target its riches: Melting ice caps, the influx of trawlers and tourists and Shell's pounds 4bn investment to drill for fossil fuels in the Chukchi Sea all raise fears of environmental havoc",Denmark,"It is home to a quarter of the planet's oil and natural gas reserves, yet humans have hardly touched these resources in the far north. But in a few days that could change dramatically if Shell receives approval to drill for oil in the Arctic.|||The company has invested $4bn to set up exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea, north of the Bering Straits. Once permission is given by the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, - possibly in a few weeks - exploration will begin using wells in Arctic waters.|||And that will bring trouble. Environment campaigners say that drilling could have terrible effects on the waters and wildlife of the Arctic. ""It took a vast effort to clean up the recent spill in the Gulf of Mexico,"" said John Sauven of Greenpeace. ""There are no such resources to stop a spill in the Chukchi. The consequences could be devastating and very long lasting.""|||But Shell rejects this claim. It has an oil spill response capability that includes barges, helicopters, booms, and other equipment should anything happen, said an official. Drilling will be safe.|||Exploiting the Arctic's vast oil reserves is just one cause of environmental unease, however. The far north is melting and far faster than predicted. Global temperatures have risen 0.7C since 1951. In Greenland, the average temperature has gone up by 1.5C. Its ice cap is losing an estimated 200bn tonnes a year as a result. And further rises are now deemed inevitable, causing the region's ice to disappear long before the century's end.|||As a result, global powers are beginning to look to the region for its gas and oil, minerals, fish, sea routes and tourist potential. All were once hidden by ice. Now it is disappearing, raising lucrative prospects for Arctic nations, in particular Russia, the US, Canada, Norway and Denmark, which controls Greenland. Large-scale investment could bring riches to areas of poverty, it is argued. However, development could destroy pristine ecosystems and the ways of life for people like the Inuit of Greenland and the Sami of Scandinavia.|||One example is highlighted by Professor Callum Roberts, a York University marine biologist. An ice-free Arctic could be stripped of its rich fisheries in a matter of years, he told the Observer. ""There are significant fish resources under the Arctic ice at present. But as that ice disappears, that protection will be removed and we can expect a rush from fishing fleets to exploit them. They have already stripped the North Atlantic of its cod, ling and other fish. Now they have their eyes on the Arctic.""|||Currently only one fishing ground in the Arctic is protected: the area around the Bering Straits, where the US has imposed a moratorium. Elsewhere there is nothing to stop fleets moving in as ice disappears. ""The north polar seas have provided fish like the cod with a last refuge. That may not last much longer.""|||Other changes are less worrying. Two new sea routes have opened up as ice has retreated: the Northwest Passage across the northern edge of Canada and the Northern Sea Route across Russia. The latter is seen as the most promising. Instead of heading south, and through the Suez canal, to get to western Europe, ships from east Asia can sail through the Bering Straits and slip along the coast of Siberia, shaving a third off their journey. In 2010, four ships took this route. Last summer, this increased to 34, with many more expected this year.|||Then there is tourism. Today, thanks to that disappearing ice, you can follow the route John Franklin took on his doomed 1845 expedition. Adventure Canada, a tour company, operates a cruise ship that can carry up to 200 people through the islands of northern Canada where Franklin and his men becoming trapped by ice and turned to cannibalism in a bid to survive. The voyage begins in Greenland and ends in Coppermine, in western Canada, at a price of $7,000-$17,000 a head. ""We have had the market much to ourselves since we started in 2008, but this year we have found other companies have started sniffing around,"" said Rebecca Burgum of Adventure Canada.|||However, it is the prospect of oil drilling that causes most unease. Apart from Shell, Norway's Statoil, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Russia's Rosneft have all revealed plans to drill in the Arctic. Given the huge amounts of hydrocarbons there, this enthusiasm is not surprising. But there are dangers in drilling in the far north that do not exist elsewhere, warns a recent report by the insurance market Lloyds, Arctic Opening: Opportunity and Risk in the High North. In particular, there is the problem of drilling through the permafrost, which could warm up and destabilise a well's foundations, ""potentially leading to a blowout"". In addition, icebreakers are in short supply along with Arctic-class mobile rigs that could drill relief wells in the event of a spill. In short, great caution will be needed before the Arctic oil industry moves from exploration to full production by the end of the decade.|||Changes are certainly coming to the Arctic. Indeed, if some scientists are correct, it could be transformed at a far quicker rate than politicians or businessmen realise. Most follow current advice that it will take at least a couple of decades for the Arctic to lose its ice. However, Peter Wadhams, a professor of ocean physics at the University of Cambridge, believes that it will take much less time. ""I think it could be gone in summer in four years. It sounds unlikely but that is what the figures indicate,"" he told the Observer from Longyearbyen, in Svalbard, in Norway's northern Arctic archipelago.|||Wadhams has just completed a study of ice thickness. Using robot submarines, he has made detailed measurements of the depths of ice sheets, while aircraft have surveyed the heights of these floes. ""Our work indicates that Arctic ice has lost 70% of its volume in the past 30 years thanks to global warming. If you extrapolate, it means it could disappear completely for a month or two in summer by 2016. Certainly it is going to go sooner rather than later.""|||The consequences for the planet will be grim. Without the white brilliance of the ice to reflect sunlight back into space, it will warm even more. Seabed temperatures will rise and methane deposits will melt, evaporate and bubble into the atmosphere. ""We can already see plumes appearing in many areas,"" said Wadhams. ""Given that methane is a particularly powerful greenhouse gas, that again will accelerate global warming."" Finally, the ice sheets of Greenland, no longer insulated by sea ice around its shores, will melt faster, raising sea levels. ""In effect, we are at the mercy of events up here,"" said Wadhams.|||Captions:|||Tour companies are operating cruises in the Arctic thanks to the|||disappearing ice. Alamy"

Between 1906 and 2006, only 69 ships traveled through the Northwest Passage, said Michael Byers, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia, in a recent article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. In 2010, 18 traveled through, and in 2011, 22 made the trip. As ice in the passage has dwindled, tourist trips on cruise ships and private yachts has increased, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reports.|||Gas and oil: The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2008 that the Arctic holds a wealth of undiscovered energy reserves: 90 billion of barrels of oil, 1,670 trillion cubic feet (47.3 trillion cubic meters) of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids most of it offshore. The quest for these resources is underway, in spite of setbacks. The oil company Shell announced on Monday(Sept. 17) it was delaying until next year plans to drill off the Alaskan Arctic coast. The loss of ice would make this prospecting easier.|||The problems:|||Inadequate maps: The increase in traffic brings up a navigation problem. NOAA's maps and other navigational information are unavailable or outdated in parts of the Arctic Ocean, because thick, impenetrable sea ice kept ships out. In addition, most Arctic waters that are charted were surveyed using obsolete technology dating back to the 1800s, according to NOAA.|||Little infrastructure or support: Alaska has twice the length of coastline as the lower 48 states, but the U.S. Coast Guard has extremely limited resources to devote to search-and-rescue operations or to oil spill cleanup, Siders said. Admiral Robert Papp, the Coast Guard commandant, has been quoted in the media as saying, ""The Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic. If we are going to have a permanent presence there, it's going to require some investment. We don't have the infrastructure in place right now."" As an example of when things go wrong: In 2010, a cruise ship called the MV Clipper Adventurer ran aground in the Northwest Passage, and its passengers had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard. [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks]|||Territorial disagreements: The Arctic coastal nations, the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Denmark (Greenland is a Danish territory) are seeking to lay claim to territory far out over the continental shelves, but the United States can't lay its own claim and has little say in others because the U.S. is not a party to the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty, CNN Money reports. There are other territorial issues as well, for instance, Canada maintains that the Northwest Passage is sovereign Canadian territory, while other nations, including the U.S., maintain that it is an international strait.|||The loss of summer ice will not, however, transform the Arctic into the Caribbean.|||Some of the challenges to operating in the Arctic are and have been the same for a very long time, Siders said, adding these will remain at least to some degree, requiring people to work in the dark, in the cold, in the middle of a storm, as earlier arrivals have done before.|||Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

On Monday, Leona Aglukkaq, minister of the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency, sketched out Canada's plans. ""The well-being and prosperity of people living in the North must be at the forefront of Canada's Arctic Council priorities,"" Ms. Aglukkaq said at a meeting of the council in Norway.|||That does involve resource development, which has become a bigger issue as evidence mounts that warming temperatures are melting the region's ice, potentially making resource exploitation and shipping easier there.|||""Canada is determined to see Northern communities benefit from the economic boom that is unfolding in the region,"" Ms. Aglukkaq said.|||The Arctic Council, whose members include the U.S., Russia, Denmark and current chair Sweden, was set up in 1996 as an intergovernmental forum for coordination among Arctic states. Experts see the region as an area of potential diplomatic dispute as countries move to develop its potentially bountiful and lucrative resources.|||With diplomatic tussles over Arctic waters and land on the increase, Canada believes that the voice of local indigenous populations may be drowned out.|||Native protests are currently at the top of the agenda within Canada after a hunger strike by a native chief here sparked a series of demonstrations across the country.|||Last year, Russia surprised the Council when it refused to send a representative to a group that represents its northern aboriginals at meetings. Ms. Aglukkaq, an Inuk who was born and raised in the Arctic territory of Nunavut, expressed her ""concern"" at the move.|||About 12.5% of the Arctic's 4 million inhabitants are indigenous people.|||Speaking at the Arctic Frontiers Conference on Monday, Ms. Aglukkaq said safe shipping in the Arctic was also on Canada's agenda. That means continuing current work on oil-spill prevention and the development of guidelines for Arctic tourism and cruise ship operators, she said.|||-For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com[http://wsj.com].

"Travel: Accommodation: The kro road: Many kro inns, royal staging posts, are now stylish lodges, with food reflecting the country's culinary renaissance, finds Caroline Hunter",Denmark,"The origins of Denmark kro inns date back to the 13th century when King Erik Klipping grew weary of finding food and lodging for his men, and decreed that for every mile of land travelled, there should be an inn as a staging post to provide decent food and drink and a place to rest.|||Many still exist, easily spotted by their downy thatch roofs and often half-timbered walls, and are nestled away in some of the country's more remote areas - making them a good choice of accommodation if you're planning to explore the remarkably flat Danish countryside independently.|||Some kro still offer no-frills accommodation and rustic, carb-heavy cuisine. But for many, a transformation has taken place. Interiors have been upgraded to take advantage of the country's world-famous furniture. And with Denmark currently in the grip of a gastronomic renaissance, for many kro it's all about the food. I visited some of the best.|||Henne Kirkeby Kro|||Hidden among the heathlands of west Jutland, this boutique-style inn was recently updated to appeal to hip, young urbanites. With its redbrick walls and hobbit-like doors, from the outside it resembles a quaint but ordinary farmhouse. But step inside and prepare to be wowed; in each of the five individually designed rooms, you'll find plush beds, moody lighting and mirrored glass sliding doors that conceal ultra-modern washrooms. Run by Michelin-starred, ex-pat Brit chef and local celebrity Paul Cunningham, the kro houses an impressive collection of contemporary photography. In the enormous back garden, resident chefs gather herbs, vegetables and roots to be used in fancy Nordic-inspired dishes such as Faeno pheasant with herbs, corn and barley.|||* +45 7525 5400, hennekirkebykro.dk.

Modernised in 2008, the inn is in Lasby, on the edge of the stunning Danish Lake District in central Jutland. Recipes are created from ingredients sourced from the surrounding forests and lakes as well as flowers plucked from his own back garden. I sampled a four-course menu which included crab with fennel and green pea stack and salmon with sour cream, melon and lavender oil. Each dish looked like a work of art.|||* +45 8694 3716, nr-vissing-kro.dk. Doubles from pounds 100. Four-course lunch around pounds 55|||The Norby Kro|||Set within a 300-year-old parish farm on the sleepy, windswept island of Fano, the emphasis at Norby Kro is on tradition and quality, with the simple white- and olive-coloured complex housing an impressive-looking restaurant and a wine cellar with up to 3,000 bottles of wine. I stayed in a suite - an extremely comfy two-room apartment with squishy white sofas, a spa-like bathroom and an open fireplace.|||* +45 7516 3589, noerbykro.dk.

Everything from the imposing grandfather clock to the original 18th-century decorative tiles that line the restaurant walls serve to give this place the snug and cosy ambience of a ship's cabin. The restaurant has a long tradition in offering gourmet cuisine and its four-course menu - which includes lightly salted codfish, glazed fennel and marcona almonds - all make full use of the island's raw ingredients. At the time of my visit, the restaurant was heaving with locals and tourists.

Environment: Frozen frontiers,Denmark,"For a body that has just undergone the biggest transformation in its 17-year history, the Arctic Council is hopelessly self-effacing.|||Tucked away at the end of a long, dim corridor inside a building full of polar researchers in Norway's northern city of Tromsø, it has just a handful of staff in a few temporary offices and an unpretentious meeting room.|||It hardly seems much for the club of eight countries with territory inside the Arctic Circle: the US, Russia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Finland and Denmark, which represents Greenland.|||Like so much else in the Arctic, however, this is about to change. At a little-noticed signing ceremony three weeks ago, the council finally set up a permanent secretariat in Tromsø with its first full-time director, a senior Icelandic civil servant. Soon, it will have more staff, a grander office and a bigger presence.|||It was, says Espen Barth Eide, Norway's foreign minister, ""a very important day in the history of the Arctic"".|||Yet this is only the latest sign of a surge in diplomatic, commercial and scientific activity in one of the world's last unspoilt wildernesses. Much of this Arctic awakening is being driven by the belief that rapidly melting Arctic ice will unleash access to more than a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas deposits, plus a lot of fish and tourist attractions.|||The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.|||< > So far, it has unfolded peacefully. But two distinct schools of thought are emerging about whether it will stay this way or eventually erupt into what Scott Borgerson, a US maritime policy specialist, has described as ""an armed mad dash"" for resource spoils in a region that never expected to need the rules to prevent such chaos.|||""Either outcome is possible,"" says Canadian academic, Michael Byers, author of Who Owns the Arctic? Right now, he says, ""there is a concerted effort on the part of all the Arctic countries to steer future development towards co-operation and away from conflict"".|||But doubts persist. ""It sounds like Europe in 1935,"" says Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary's Centre for Military and Strategic Studies, the co-author of a study showing that some Arctic countries, including Russia, have already started rebuilding their Arctic military capabilities while others have plans to follow.|||Such is the uncertain backdrop to a region producing more surprises each year, not least in the shipping trade.|||The Arctic is home to two potentially game-changing shipping routes: the Northwest Passage through the Canadian archipelago and the Northern Sea Route above Russia.|||Each is thousands of kilometres shorter than current routes between Europe and Asia, and would be thousands of dollars cheaper to use - if they weren't full of ice for much of the year. But as the Arctic continues to warm faster than climate science models predict, this is changing fast, especially in the more developed Northern Sea Route over Russia.|||Last year 46 ships passed along this route, up from just four in 2010, according to data from the Centre for High North Logistics, a non-profit group backed by Norway's government that promotes Arctic shipping.|||Those 46 ships included polar research icebreaker the Snow Dragon, the first Chinese ship to make an Arctic crossing.|||""It was striking how little ice there actually was during the voyage,"" says Egill Thor Nielsson, an Icelandic researcher aboard the vessel.|||Still, the Suez and Panama canals are unlikely to be worried just yet. They had more than 30,000 passages between them in 2012, said Paal Hilde of the Norwegian Institute of Defence Studies. ""The Northern Sea Route has to grow massively to become any kind of competitor with these other routes,"" he says.|||But the prospect of more shipping in a region where an oil spill could cause extreme environmental damage is of mounting concern, and not just to green activists.|||Cruise ship numbers in remote parts of the Arctic have grown over the past decade to the point at which, in peak season, there are as many as eight ships a week between Greenland and sparsely populated Spitsbergen Island, says Norway's vice-admiral Haakon Bruun-Hanssen.|||Some have upwards of 3,000 passengers, more than Spitsbergen's population, he told an Arctic conference in Tromsø last month.|||""Due to the size of these ships, any accidents in these areas will have a catastrophic magnitude,"" he said.|||These maritime developments are among the most visible signs of change in the Arctic, and a big reason why bodies such as the Arctic Council are now unusually popular. When it was founded in 1996, the council agreed to admit organisations with an interest in the region as observers. A few European nations joined, including Germany and the UK, as well as the World Wildlife Fund and some less obvious groups, such as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.|||Over the years, the observer waiting list grew longer (there are now 14 applications outstanding) and more Asian. China applied in 2006, South Korea in 2008 (along with the EU), Japan in 2009, Singapore in 2011 and India in 2012.|||Those who watch the council's workings closely trace the delays to a mix of diplomatic wrangles. Canada, for example, has been in dispute with the EU over Brussels' ban on seal products.|||Norway has until recently been wary of China, following Beijing's fury over the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize going to jailed Chinese dissident writer Liu Xiaobo.|||All of these, however, are an aside. The real measure of the council's importance has more to do with what its eight permanent member states are doing, not least its most powerful, the US.|||The last time the council had one of its two-yearly ministerial meetings, in 2011, Washington did two things it had never done before: it sent Hillary Clinton, its secretary of state, to the meeting rather than a more junior diplomat, and agreed to the setting up of a permanent secretariat.|||The same meeting signed off on another first: a binding treaty requiring the eight council members to co-ordinate the search-and-rescue efforts likely to be needed as a thawing Arctic makes shipping easier.|||May's ministerial meeting is expected to finalise a second treaty, this time on oil spill prevention, as well as the observer waiting list.|||For all that, the Arctic issue that provokes the most long-term anxiety is the region's oil and gas potential.|||The last public estimate of what lies beneath the region's seabed comes from a 2008 US Geological Survey study that showed the Arctic could have as much as 30 per cent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil.|||As the Arctic melts, it is naturally assumed that companies will be more eager to extract this bounty. But so far, experts say the price of oil has been much more influential.|||The Arctic is undergoing its second period of offshore exploration, says Andrew Latham of the Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy. During the first, in the 1970s and 1980s, as many as 20 new wells a year were drilled. That number dipped during the 1990s in line with global oil prices, but it is now rising. Wood Mackenzie thinks the number of new wells drilled will only reach about 10 per year in the near term, despite the changing climate. ""Fundamentally, the oil price is what you are talking about,"" says Dr Latham, adding that the amount companies are spending in this expensive and inhospitable region is relatively small in proportion to their investments in other countries.|||Individually, however, the costs are large. Royal Dutch Shell has just spent $5bn struggling to drill wells off Alaska, and the UK's Cairn Energy has spent more than $1bn on fruitless drilling off Greenland.|||And these costs look even higher considering the USGS study appeared towards the beginning of a revolution in US shale gas and oil production. Since then, predictions of future global energy supplies have been overturned. Last year US gas prices were down to their lowest level in a decade.|||""That means very, very expensive gas sitting offshore in the Arctic is now even more difficult to bring to market than it was before,"" says the USGS's Dr Donald L. Gautier, principal investigator for the 2008 assessment.|||Still, the potential worth of these resources in a world whose energy-hungry population is forecast to grow from 7bn to as much as 9bn by 2050 is clear. Clearer, some say, than the rules governing who will be able to extract them.|||First in line are the five states with an extensive Arctic coastline: Russia, the US, Canada, Norway and Denmark.|||Under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, each country has rights to an Exclusive Economic Zone stretching 200 nautical miles offshore that lets it extract fish or fossil fuels from in or under the sea.|||Beyond that 200 nautical mile limit, things become more tricky.|||Countries that have ratified the Law of the Sea convention can make a submission for more extensive seabed rights if they can prove their continental shelves extend that far.|||So far, Russia and Norway are alone among the five Arctic coastal states to have made such a submission and Norway's relatively modest claim has been approved.|||Russia, which made a much bigger grab for an area extending up to the North Pole, was told to come back with better data.|||It was an expedition to gather this evidence that led to the planting of a Russian flag on the North Pole seabed in 2007, a move that set off much of the anxiety about potential Arctic conflict.|||The US has not ratified the Law of the Sea convention, despite the best efforts of much of its foreign policy elite, who say this could undermine its ability to assert its rights in future.|||Canada and Denmark are due to make their submissions shortly. Once they do, the world will see if their claims overlap with those of Russia.|||""This is where talk of the potential conflict in the Arctic comes about,"" says Martin Pratt, an international maritime boundaries expert at the UK's Durham university.|||Prof Pratt says such talk is overblown, arguing that experience of settling Arctic boundary disputes suggest that even if there are overlapping claims, they will be peacefully resolved.|||In addition, all five Arctic coastal states agreed in 2008 they would settle any territorial disputes under accepted principles of international law as they extended their claims to more Arctic territory.|||And all except Russia are Nato allies, so are considered unlikely to start firing on each other.|||Meanwhile, even with record Arctic thawing, oil and gas operations in the region remain difficult and expensive.|||""In 50 years, if the ice cap is gone, it might change somewhat,"" says Prof Pratt. ""But it's still going to be cold, it's still going to be stormy and it's still going to be dark. It isn't the first place in the world you would look to exploit oil if you were given the choice."""
With enemies like the Better Together campaign who needs friends?,Denmark,"INDEPENDENCE has its costs. Things aren’t looking good. “The public finances are likely to come under pressure over the longer term primarily as a result of the ageing population ... the Government would end up having to spend more as a share of national income on age-related items such as pensions and healthcare ... non-demographic trends are likely to reduce revenue from sources such as North Sea oil.”|||Oh, well. That’s it – we’re stuffed. Why weren’t we told this before? Actually, we were. That quote above is not from John Swinney’s leaked report to the Scottish Government. It is from the report by the Office For Budget Responsibility’s Fiscal Sustainability Report, presented to the UK Coalition Government in July 2012 – and the country it refers to is the UK. These affordability issues are the same north and south of the Border – actually, they are less of a problem in Scotland.|||Swinney’s “bombshell report” wasn’t about “cutting pensions” as some parts of the press claimed, it was about how much Scotland could reasonably put into an oil fund for the future given its social-spending commitments. Choices have to be made. You can’t expect an independent Scotland to be immune from economic uncertainty, immune to the ageing population, immune to recession and fluctuating oil prices. But no credible economist seriously argues today that Scotland could not survive as an independent small nation like Norway, Denmark or Finland.|||Actually, in an age of economic uncertainty, John Swinney is a useful guy to have around. He is ultra-cautious, often to the despair of his Cabinet colleagues. But this Finance Secretary has achieved a remarkable feat over the last six years in managing to afford all of Alex Salmond’s giveaway policies – abolition of student fees, free prescriptions, free bus passes, free personal care – within a static budget that has been squeezed in real terms. Commentators like me kept saying it couldn’t be done, that the SNP Government would find it impossible to balance the books without cutting spending on health. We were wrong.|||SO, the fact that cautious John was trying to rein in his high-spending Cabinet colleagues by telling them a few home truths is no bad thing. The fact it was leaked last week will, I think, be to the Yes campaign’s long-term benefit, provided they don’t retreat into a defensive shell, snarling about the “Unionist press”. The press coverage was over the top, economically illiterate and rather childish. But you don’t get to choose the press and this is the same media that will be covering the independence campaign next year.|||The SNP will have to find ways of addressing Scotland’s fears if it wants to get this anxious, risk-averse nation to step into the unknown. This is the downside of basing the case for independence on economics alone. It’s not called the dismal science for nothing. Even the most benign economic picture can look bleak if you focus on risk. Better Together leaked Swinney’s “secret files” to coincide with publication of the latest Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures, an annual statement showing the balance between spending and tax revenues. This year it confirmed Scotland’s deficit would be 5% of GDP – but that is substantially less than the UK deficit of 8%.|||In other words, Scotland is in a much better place financially right now than the rest of the UK. Did no-one notice that the UK lost its AAA rating the other week? And remember that if Scotland were independent, the UK would not be able to rely on the £11 billion a year from the North Sea, so its deficit would rise.|||This is important. It means Scotland is in no danger of becoming another Greece, or Ireland – unable to pay its way and suffering a sovereign debt crisis and internal devaluation. This is not exclusively because of the £1.5 trillion of oil in the North Sea. Scotland has five of the world’s leading universities, one-quarter of Europe’s offshore wind and wave energy, one of the most valuable tourist brands in the world and luxury exports such as whisky, which brings in £4bn a year. We might even be capable of making things if we had any industry left.|||But there is nothing certain in economics, and the job of a finance minister is not to tell people what they want to hear. Oil revenues are volatile. Ten years ago, the price of a barrel was less than half what it is today. It would be unwise for an independent Scotland to rely on natural resources alone, and a proper industrial strategy would have to be introduced to diversify the Scottish economy. But an independent Scotland would be less dependent on oil income than Norway, which has the world’s highest standard of living.|||We have an ageing population, a situation marginally worse in Scotland than in England. I say “worse” – in fact, people living longer is a very good thing. But it does mean you need lots of young workers to pay the taxes to look after them. Ten years ago, everyone believed Scotland’s population was going to decline below five million. In fact, it has risen to 5.3 million: its highest level ever. All those young Polish workers coming here are having large families, which has turned the situation round. But with the UK imposing ever tighter immigration restrictions, this may be choked off if Scotland stays in the UK.|||Meanwhile, Scotland exports many of its graduates and skilled workers because we don’t have jobs for them here. When I was rector of Edinburgh University, I was acutely aware this world-class institution was churning out large numbers of brilliant graduates who would never find work in Scotland. They take their learning south or abroad, which is what Scots have been doing for the past 200 years.|||Now, an independent Scotland might make this worse; there is no guarantee of anything. But I am finding it increasingly hard to see how Scotland’s problems can be addressed without substantially greater economic powers and investment. Scotland’s industry has long gone; the start-up rate for new businesses is dismal; the financial sector – look at RBS – is in crisis. Scotland is falling off the economic map in a UK dominated by the city state of London.|||It’s the HS2 factor: Scotland pays, through taxes and oil revenues, to build a high-speed rail network which starts in London and stops at Manchester. Last week, we learned that 6000 troops which were supposed to come to Scotland will go to Salisbury and Northern Ireland. Even Lord Heseltine says that the greatest problem facing he UK is over-centralisation of economic life in London and the southeast.|||Devolution has begun to address the “democratic deficit” in Scotland, but what the Scottish Parliament lacks is power to address very deep-seated economic problems. It isn’t only Nationalists who are concerned about this.|||As I pointed out last week, the Labour shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, is proposing a national convention, to look at ways of preventing a No in the referendum leading to a decade of despair in Scotland.|||If Scotland votes No, there will be no Union dividend to fall back on. Living on handouts from Westminster is no longer an option. Debilitating dependency will only turn Scotland into the introverted, negative and depressed little country that is presented to us every week in much of the Scottish press.|||That is the true message of Swinney’s secret bombshell. The SNP should start leaking these bombshell reports on a monthly basis."
"Icy Arctic is economic, security hot spot As polar region thaws, global rivalries and lucrative resources spur race to grab access.",Denmark,"WASHINGTON • The icy Arctic is emerging as a global economic hot spot — and one that is becoming a security concern for the U.S. as world powers jockey to tap its vast energy resources and stake out unclaimed territories.|||Diplomats from eight Arctic nations, including Secretary of State John Kerry, will meet next week over how to protect the thawing region as its waterways increasingly open to commercial shipping traffic.|||U.S. officials estimate the Arctic holds 13 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of undiscovered gas deposits. Until recently, however, the lucrative resources that could reap hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue were frozen over and unreachable.|||But global warming has melted sea ice to levels that have given rise to what experts describe as a kind of gold rush scramble to the Arctic.|||On Friday, President Barack Obama announced a new U.S. strategy for the Arctic, calling the region “an amazing place” and maintaining a need among nations to protect its fragile environment and keep it free of conflict.|||“An undisciplined approach to exploring new opportunities in this frontier could result in significant harm to the region, to our national security interests, and to the global good,” the 13-page strategy concluded.|||The Arctic is getting hotter faster than any part of the globe. Experts predict the region will be free of sea ice during the summer within about 20 years. Sea ice is important because it keeps the rest of the world cooler, and some scientific studies suggest that its melting may be indirectly connected to the extreme weather in the United States and elsewhere in the past few years, changing global weather patterns, including the track of Superstorm Sandy.|||The environmental changes could threaten not only polar bears, whales, seals and indigenous peoples, but also islands and low-lying areas from Florida to Bangladesh.|||Yet the melting may be a boon for business. New shipping routes could provide faster and cheaper passageway for worldwide exports and cargo hauling, including everything from food and electronics to cars and military equipment. And it could also bolster global tourism with cruises in the region’s around-the-clock summertime daylight.|||But the big prize is the vast and untapped supply of oil, gas, minerals and precious metals that are believed to be buried in the Arctic. Already, there is a global race to get energy out of areas that in the past were locked up in ice and frozen ground.|||In 2007, a Russian research ship placed a Russian flag on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole in a symbolic gesture. And last year, China joined Russia, Denmark and Canada and the United States in the competition, sending its first icebreaker ship through the Arctic — even though China doesn’t abut Arctic territory.|||Economic rivalries in the Arctic have made the area a burgeoning security priority. Arctic nations are eyeing sending additional military forces to the region to maintain stability on the seas and protect against maritime crime, according to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service.|||Russia is planning to train and equip a brigade of military troops specifically for Arctic warfare, and Canada is revitalizing its Arctic fleet with $33 billion to build 28 ships over the next 30 years. Norway, Denmark and the U.S. are all expanding military command centers and operations within the Arctic.|||The U.S. Navy is nearing the end of a five-year plan, set in 2009, to plot out what path it will take in the Arctic. That may include policing waterways and interdicting pirates as it does in warmer waters. And the Coast Guard’s small Arctic ice-breaking fleet is getting a much-needed boost: One of its three ships is about to be relaunched after being docked for major repairs. Another ship is already fully operational, and the third is out of service, officials said.|||Next year, the Navy and Coast Guard will draw up plans to have an enduring presence in the Arctic and be able to run search and rescue operations there, Navy chief Adm. Jonathan Greenert said in congressional testimony last month.|||The military ramp-up is a piece of what experts say is an inevitable political competition that will grow in the Arctic as it opens."
DJ Arctic Council Considers China's Bid to Observe Meeting,Denmark,"The Arctic Council, a once-obscure regional forum that had little to show for itself, has nations queuing to participate at a meeting this week in Sweden, as melting ice makes shipping, tourism and resource extraction a reality in the nebulously delineated region.|||Among the 14 countries and organizations seeking so-called observer status at the meeting in Kiruna, northern Sweden, will be China, whose increased interest in the Arctic underscores the region's re-emergence as an area of potential geopolitical intrigue.|||The council's eight permanent members--the U.S., Canada, Russia and five Nordic nations--must agree to admit the new members. The Nordic nations, which have been courted aggressively by China, say they will. Canada has expressed reservations. It is unclear whether the U.S., which is sending Secretary of State John Kerry to the meeting, and Russia will agree, as they wake up to the increased economic, and perhaps military, potential of the vast stretches of Arctic territory within and north of their borders.|||""Joining the council is more a political statement from countries like China,"" said Malte Humpert, an executive director at the Arctic Institute, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank, ""the idea of having a seat at the table in a region that is likely to become another realm of geopolitics.""|||Begun in 1996 as a body to coordinate Arctic policy, the council was for many years seen as a platform for scientists to swap research on environmental issues. More recently, it has gained prominence amid expectations that melting ice will clear the way for more resource development and free up trade routes.|||In 2008, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated some 22% of the world's undiscovered oil and natural-gas deposits are located above the Arctic Circle.|||On Wednesday, Canada will take over the council chairmanship in a meeting that will include signing a treaty on oil-spill preparedness and response as well as the decision on whether to increase the roster of permanent observers, with India, Japan, Italy and the European Union joining China and others on the list.|||Observer status, currently held by six countries, grants holders little more than the ability to attend meetings and propose projects, which then need to be approved by the permanent members.|||But Beijing and Chinese businesses have been aggressively courting the council's Nordic members in a bid, analysts say, to get a toehold in the Arctic. In April, China signed a free-trade deal with Iceland, its first with a European nation. In June 2012, then-Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Denmark, when Chinese companies signed a number of commercial deals. Chinese companies have also invested in Greenland, a self-governing part of Denmark.|||That appears to be paying off.|||""Our opinion is that the countries which have a legitimate interest in discussing Arctic issues must be accepted as observers in the Arctic Council,"" Danish minister of foreign affairs, Villy Sovndal, said in an interview when asked about China's bid to join.|||Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said that all of the Nordic countries agreed that all of the applicants should be allowed in.

Pentagon Releases Strategy For Arctic,Denmark,"WASHINGTON -- As a shrinking northern ice cap sets the stage for increased competition over natural resources, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday released the Pentagon's first ''Arctic Strategy,'' intended to safeguard American security interests and the region's environment.|||Speaking at an international security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Mr. Hagel described the challenges facing the world as rising global temperatures shrink the polar ice and as Russia, China and other nations compete for economic opportunities and influence in the region.|||He noted that tourism, shipping and commercial fishing might gravitate toward new Arctic sea routes, but he underscored in particular what could happen as nations vied for the region's vast quantities of oil and gas.|||''A flood of interest in energy exploration has the potential to heighten tensions over other issues,'' Mr. Hagel said. Multilateral security cooperation will be a priority, he added, as ''this will ultimately help reduce the risk of conflict.''|||Although the Arctic is a region of established nations, including the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden, the polar north will be shaped by economic, political and security issues arising from elsewhere around the world, Mr. Hagel said.|||''Among them are the growing economic and geopolitical importance of the Asia-Pacific; conflict and instability across the Middle East and North Africa; the unprecedented diffusion of global economic power; new sources of and demand for energy; the rise of China, India, Brazil and other nations; environmental degradation and devastating natural disasters; and the role of technology in closely linking the world's people, their aspirations and their grievances,'' he said.|||While ''climate change does not directly cause conflict,'' Mr. Hagel said, it may ''significantly add to the challenges of global instability, hunger, poverty and conflict.'' He cited ''food and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and resources, and more severe natural disasters.''|||The Pentagon's Arctic strategy places a priority on preparations to detect, deter, prevent and defeat threats to the United States even as the nation ''will continue to exercise U.S. sovereignty in and around Alaska,'' Mr. Hagel said.|||The strategy calls for working with ''private and public sector partners,'' including the State of Alaska and federal agencies such as the Coast Guard, he added, ''to improve our understanding and awareness of the Arctic environment so that we can operate safely and effectively.''|||The Defense Department also seeks to preserve freedom of the seas throughout the Arctic region.|||A new focus on the Arctic will require the Pentagon to reshape its infrastructure and capabilities in the region. ''We are beginning to think about and plan for how our naval fleet and other capabilities and assets will need to adapt to the evolving shifts and requirements in the region,'' the defense secretary said.|||The United States has about 27,000 military personnel from active-duty units, the National Guard and reserves stationed in the Arctic, in Alaska. C-130 transport planes equipped with skis for landing and takeoff are deployed there, and nuclear submarines routinely patrol the polar region."

For a start, there's not a thread of tartan to be seen.|||""Och, no,"" said the Ghost, ""We only ever wore that stuff to show we were different from yon Sassenach softies. Don't need all that Jock rubbish any more. The same with those hairy skirts. They were hell to wear — it used to get bloody freezing, particularly in the Gorbals.""|||Surely all that other stuff goes on? Tossing the caber? The Queen doing Scottish reels with her ghillie? ""The who? Aye, I think I remember her — wee lassie in a headscarf, bairn on the dole? Alex Salmond kicked her oot years ago. Thought she came on a bit aggressive at the 700th anniversary party at Bannockburn three months before the independence vote, and never forgave her.""|||So she just comes to Balmoral on her holidays, then? ""Balmoral?"" said the Ghost, ""Ah! You'll be meaning President Connery's hoose. I don't think he has many people to stay there. Doesn't go there much himself, either — tax reasons.|||Careful with the groats, that one. Looks after his bawbees, too.""|||The Ghost tossed me a coin. A familiar bearded face with angry eyebrows scowled from it. There was a big gothic G on the other side.|||Glancing around the shops on the Royal Mile — ""Sean's Mile, you mean?"" said the Ghost — it suddenly became clear. In every window, gone were the pound signs, replaced on the price tags by the big G and a lower-case b. The ""Andy Murray, Grand Slam champion 2020"" commemorative shortbread was reduced to 9 groats and 99 bawbees a kilo.|||""Aye, we are metric,"" said the Ghost. ""Wee Alex Salmond didnae like the sound of imperial measures. Reminded him too much of the evil, old empire.""|||Surely Salmond wanted to hold on to the pound? ""Aye — but he also wanted all the oil money,"" said the Ghost, ""and he didnae want any part of the Sassenach £1.2 trillion debt. He couldnae have all three. So he went for the oil, the mingin' numpty!"" But North Sea oil must have made Scotland a few quid — I mean, groats? ""Aye, Scottish National Oil made a whole pile of groats,"" said the Ghost, who turned out to be quite the economist, ""but wee Alex spent even more. The problem was, the wee bampot hadn't done his sums.""|||The Ghost paused outside St Giles's Cathedral as he ran through the list of things promised by the first minister when the white paper on Scotland's future was published in November 2013: free term-time childcare for all three and fouryear-olds; an end to the bedroom tax; continued membership of the national lottery; a Scottish Broadcasting Service.|||""We still get all the best English television programmes — except Downton Abbey,"" said the Ghost. ""Banned on class grounds. Oh, and the SBS couldn't afford ITV's fees — couldnae get the advertising.""|||"" A chilling curtain of rain came sweeping up the hill from Leith, as the list of promises went on and on: increased benefits and tax thresholds; the abolition of universal credit; new wind farms and marine energy schemes, as part of Salmond's promise that 100% of Scotland's electricity would come from green sources by 2020.|||""That hasn't quite happened,"" said the Ghost, pointing to a lone turbine, turning limply in the Firth of Forth. ""And it didn't help when Continued on page 2 ?? WW|||? Continued from page 1 the Grangemouth refinery was occupied by Trotskyite trade unionists. ""Still, good old Fidel has got his hands on some Venezuelan oil for us. Even in his nineties, he won't miss a chance to bash the Trots.

They often Skype each other.""|||What about all that Scottish oil, then? Wasn't that the stuff that greased the whole white paper, the fuel that powered Scottish independence? Didn't the SNP predict that Scottish GDP per head would be 20% higher than the UK's? ""It might have worked,"" said the Ghost, as we walked back down Sean's Mile, ""but wee Alex promised too much with too little. The energy price freeze didn't help either. They borrowed that off yon prime minister who looked like Wallace from Wallace and Gromit.""|||Ed Miliband, it turned out, had swept to power at Westminster in 2015 — and swept out of power shortly after when he lost his Scottish MPs on independence day and the Labour government collapsed.|||Like all his friends, the Ghost was out of work, although he had a PhD from St Andrews University in macroeconomics. At least, he had no student loan to repay. ""Didn't cost me a bawbee,"" said the Ghost, ""No tuition fees for Scots. Double tuition fees for all foreigners. Oh, except Englishmen — they pay triple.""|||What about if you're from Wales? Or Northern Ireland? ""You mean the Republics of Wales and Ulster?"" Oh yes, they got independence, too. As did the Isle of Man and Catalonia.|||Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb seized Andalucia, and Italy reverted to a series of independent states. Silvio Berlusconi is now King of Lombardy.|||So what happened to the EU? ""Oh, it's still going strong,"" said the Ghost. ""We weren't allowed back in, because we didn't pass the economic tests. Nor were Wales or Northern Ireland. And your prime minister, yon Farage — the one who's partial to a bevvy and a fag — he took England oot, too. Sweden, Finland and Denmark joined Greater Norway; and Vladimir Putin used Arctic oil to bribe the eastern members to switch to his Eurasian Union. So that left Germany and France in the EU.

""Aye, the Scottish army is a marvellous thing,"" said the Ghost, gazing at the soldier with pride, ""No one can say we didn't pull that one off!"" So Salmond had fulfilled his great promise in the white paper of 2013: a new Scottish defence force, consisting of 15,000 regular soldiers and a new intelligence and security agency? ""Well, not quite,"" said the Ghost, a little crestfallen. ""That splendid fellow"" — the Ghost pointed at the strutting soldier — ""is the new Scottish defence force. But he's real quality, works weekends and knows how to handle a sgiandubh.|||Don't you, Alastair?"" The marching soldier beamed back with the subtlest of nods, as he stomped over to his sentry box.|||And what about the intelligence and security agency? ""Ah!

Said we couldn't stay in unless we kept the nuclear submarines at Faslane. Alastair offered to keep an eye on the Trident missiles, didn't you?"" Alastair nodded again, almost imperceptibly, from inside the sentry box.|||""But there was no way he could get over to the west coast, and be back in time for tea with his mother in Musselburgh.""|||The English had moved their nuclear missiles to Devonport, then? ""Och, no,"" said the shocked Ghost. ""There's nae way the Independent Republic of Devon and Cornwall would put up with that! The People's State of Wessex didnae want them either. So the MoD keep the missiles in a shed in the back garden of Downing Street — they put the subs in a marina near Battersea.""|||The Ghost led me down the hill to Waverley station. Gone was the man in the kilt and the tam o'shanter who used to play the bagpipes for Japanese tourists outside the train station.|||""Oh, he got rid of his kilt years ago — wears a pair of tracky bots these days,"" said the Ghost. ""Disnae bother with the bagpipes either — terrible noise, I always thought. So the Japanese stopped giving him any bawbees, the tight wee dunderheeds. ""By the way, ye'll have brought your passport? The Scottish National Rail Border Police can be a right bunch of scunners.

The Ghost gestured to the trolley rattling down the aisle, piled high with tins of Irn-Bru and McEwan's.

""Wee Alex flogged the whisky industry to Tokyo a few years back, when the oil started to run oot.""|||I settled for a strong tea and stared out of the window. Off to our right, a mighty wind was whipping the North Sea into high peaks of snow-white foam. To our left, you could just make out the purplegreen glens of the Cairngorms.

The grab for Greenland,Denmark,"On a hill above the old harbour, Hans Egede braves biting winds to keep watch over the town he founded three centuries ago. Bearing the commission of King Frederick IV of Denmark, the Lutheran pastor pitched up in Greenland in 1721. He planned to bring the Reformation to Norse settlers in this vast, frozen territory. As Egede navigated the ice fjords, he discovered his European kin had long since left in search of more clement climes. Undeterred, he set about preaching the Protestant faith to the native Inuit, supplying Greenlandic with a Latin alphabet to promote study of the scriptures. Egede's mission established itself in Godthab (Good Hope) on the southwest coast of the island. Church was soon followed by trade and later by the state. Denmark - then a European power with imperial ambitions - acquired a colony.|||Greenland is once again catching the imagination of outsiders. International business executives and diplomats are retracing Egede's journey. The rapid melting of the northern polar ice has set off something of a scramble for the resources buried below. By US estimates, the Arctic may hold 13 per cent of the world's undiscovered oil and 30 per cent of its untapped gas as well as untold mineral resources. The London-based think-tank Chatham House talks of an Arctic ""cold rush"". Greenland, a frozen and mostly empty sprawl of a country reaching up from the Atlantic to the Arctic Ocean, sees a chance to reclaim its pre-colonial identity. ""I guess we are in the business of nation-building,"" says Vittus Qujaukitsoq, the minister of economy in a government with its sights on independence.|||Egede's statue stares across the ice-speckled harbour to a cluster of timber-framed buildings housing the National Museum. Greenland has wrested autonomy from Copenhagen, and visitors to the museum's store of historic artefacts are left in little doubt about the colonial record. The hunting paraphernalia, furs, native art and wood-framed kayaks describing the harshness of polar life are accompanied by a commentary that excoriates the interlopers. Christianity and colonisation brought ""crucial ruptures . . . in the lifestyle and thinking of the Inuit"". The ""master race"" corralled the indigenous people into new settlements to better supply Denmark with the spoils of sealing, whaling and fishing. The Inuit were robbed of their spiritual compass as well as their physical freedom. The museum records this story in Greenlandic and in English - not in Danish, until recently the country's official language.|||Daniel Thorleifsen, the quietly spoken curator, brushes off my suggestion of bias in his museum's celebration of the ancient crafts of the Inuit alongside its distinctly cooler assessment of the modernity imported from Denmark. ""We are telling the history correctly. How the exploitation happened. This is not a matter of opinion,"" he says. The narrative of repression represents ""a simple statement of fact"". This was a sentiment I heard often in Greenland, sometimes from those of Danish as well as Inuit heritage. These lingering anti-colonial resentments have fired nationalist ambitions. Now they are fusing with rising hopes that Greenland is in sight of an economic boom.|||Isolated by Denmark, Greenland caught a brief glimpse of the outside world when Americans arrived during the second world war to deny Hitler's Germany an Atlantic foothold. During its nuclear stand-off with the Soviet Union, Washington stationed bombers at Thule in the far freezing north. But for the most part, Greenland has been a place the rest of the world passed by. Air travellers might glance at the dazzling, ice-sculpted terrain while crossing the Atlantic. Bands of explorers and scientists ventured north to explore the high polar terrain or to drill deep into the ice core to trace the progress of climate change. Intrepid tourists marvelled at the icebergs spilling from its glaciers into the open sea. But Greenland's frozen nothingness made international headlines only when its hunters and whalers rebelled against the save-a-seal environmentalism of the European Union.|||Things are changing. Two of the big forces shaping the world's geopolitical contours are global warming and the voracious appetite for raw materials of the world's big emerging markets. Both converge on Greenland's retreating ice-sheet. What happens next in the Arctic will touch the security and prosperity of the rest of the planet. ""The world is paying attention to Greenland,"" says Jens-Erik Kirkegaard, the government minister in charge of minerals and mining development, with more than a hint of satisfaction.|||Climate change is remaking the Arctic, opening up new transpolar trade routes and offering tantalising sight of the energy and mineral resources beneath the unforgiving tundra. The impact is being felt in changing global weather patterns, migrating fish stocks and rising seas as far away as Asia and, crucially, in the calculations of the world's great powers. Huge blocks of ice from Greenland's glaciers spill into the Atlantic currents through the Kangia Fjord. The discovery of iron ore, zinc, gold and much else has attracted prospectors from as far away as Australia. Deposits of rare earth materials could challenge China's grip on the global trade in the valuable metallic elements vital to today's technological gadgetry. Greenlanders dream that the seabed beyond its northern coast might one day yield hydrocarbons to rival the riches on the slopes of Alaska. ""Climate change,"" Qujaukitsoq says, ""is a new opportunity for Greenland.""|||Greenland isn't green. Not much of it, anyway. During the short summer a scattering of sheep peer down from the coastal hills to the ice floes below, but some 80 per cent of the two million square kilometres of territory (an area almost four times that of France) is sheeted with ice. The people - about 56,000 hardy souls at the latest count - mostly huddle together in small towns and settlements on the southwestern coastline. As the writer Sara Wheeler notes in her magnificent chronicle of the modern polar region, The Magnetic North, the country was given its name by Erik Thorvaldsson, more popularly known as Eric the Red. Arriving from Iceland during the 10th century, Erik had a 21st-century copywriter's eye for marketing. ""Gronland"", he thought, would conjure up images of fertile plains and draw in European settlers.|||This part of the world has known big changes in climate before. Warming temperatures during the eighth and ninth centuries brought Inuit tribes from Alaska and northern Canada - the Thule - who displaced the now-disappeared Dorset peoples in the frozen north. The Norse settlers arrived in the more temperate south. By the 15th century, however, the mercury was falling again. The Norse disappeared, leaving behind the Inuit who, kept warm by the skins of their prey, could scratch a subsistence life by fishing or hunting whales, walruses, seals and musk oxen.|||. . .|||The latest change in the weather pattern is faster and more pronounced. Arctic temperatures have been rising twice as fast as elsewhere. The polar region has lost about three-quarters of its sea ice. This summer the White House published a US strategy for the region. The warming trend, it said, ""is unlike anything previously recorded. The reduction in sea ice has been dramatic, abrupt, and unrelenting."" This had the potential ""to transform global climate and ecosystems as well as global shipping, energy markets and other commercial interests"". The prospects were for the opening of hitherto unnavigable sea passages from Asia to Europe and from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The thaw could make accessible ""vast quantities of mineral resources, including rare earths, emeralds, iron ore and nickel"".|||So Greenland finds itself at the heart of one of the 21st century's big geopolitical games: the race to stake out territory and interests in the world's last ungoverned space. One outcome may be a free-for-all in which competing states fight it out above and below the ice for control of trade routes and resources. Another, enshrined in the ambitions of the eight-nation Arctic Council, would see the creation of a unique structure of international co-operation charged with defusing tensions and safeguarding the unique ecology.|||For now, there are pointers in both directions. The council - comprising the five Arctic Ocean littoral states of the US, Russia, Canada, Norway and Denmark (representing Greenland), along with Sweden, Finland and Iceland - started out as a body preoccupied with the environment, marine safety and the rights of indigenous peoples. More recently it has developed a broader political remit. The so-called Arctic Five have agreed that disputes about maritime boundaries will be settled peacefully under the terms of the United Nations convention on the law of the sea. The Scandinavian members of the council see a chance to create an unprecedented model of ""preventative diplomacy"".|||Whether such goodwill outlasts serious contact with conflicting claims to mineral resources and shipping rights is a tougher question. In 2007, Moscow dispatched a submarine to plant the Russian national flag below the North Pole, thereby underscoring its claim to vast tracts of the Arctic seabed. Norway, usually nothing if not avowedly multilateral, has strengthened its military forces in the Arctic region and hosts regular exercises for Nato troops in the high north. Normally placid Canada is boisterously nationalistic about its polar territory where it is embroiled in disputes with Washington about shipping rights in the Beaufort Sea. The US, which after the second world war tried and failed to buy Greenland from Denmark (in 1917 it had completed a similar transaction with Copenhagen to secure ownership of what are now the US Virgin Islands), has only quite recently woken up to the broader strategic significance of the Arctic. US secretaries of state, who had previously deputed their juniors to handle the region, now make a point of turning up at the regular ministerial gatherings of the Arctic Council.|||The power plays reach beyond governments with an obvious territorial stake in the region. China rebranded itself a ""near-Arctic"" state some time ago. After an intense diplomatic campaign - which Russia failed to scupper - Beijing has secured a seat as an observer on the Arctic. It has signed free-trade and economic agreements with financially beleaguered Iceland in what western governments see as an attempt to establish an Arctic staging post. ""China wants to buy it,"" says one western diplomat bluntly of Beijing's courtship of Reykjavik. With an eye on potential mineral resources, Beijing may send up to 3,000 workers to open an iron ore mine in Greenland. All this stirs anxiety in Washington. ""If China is paying attention,"" a US official says, ""we cannot afford not to.""|||The pace of change in the Arctic will be slower than imagined by some excited commentators. If chunks of Greenland's glaciers now turn up as icebergs in the Caribbean, the polar region still has an awful lot of ice. China may have sent a cargo vessel to traverse the Arctic sea route above northern Russia - cutting weeks off the journey through the Suez Canal - but traffic is seasonal and negligible in comparison with traditional routes. It will be decades before the polar seaways challenge the Suez and Panama canals. Digging out minerals and pumping oil will be fraught with environmental and technical hazards. The terrain is inhospitable, communications difficult and mining operations expensive. The Inuit inhabitants of Alaska, Canada and Greenland are also determined to have their say.|||Geopolitics does not wait for the future. Governments, businesses and NGOs are rushing to stake out ground. China has been joined as an observer on the Arctic Council by India, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Italy - all states that consider they have an interest in access to new Arctic resources and trade routes. An international organisation that started out as a sleepy backwater for boffins and environmentalists has become an arena for strategic competition. Greenland's politicians may soon enough discover that climate change poses as many risks as it holds promises for a nation that wants to reclaim a vanishing identity.|||. . .|||Danish Godthab, the capital, was renamed Greenlandic Nuuk in 1979 when Greenlanders demanded autonomy from Copenhagen. A home rule agreement in that year laid the foundations for a comprehensive self-government accord in 2009. This repatriated Denmark's remaining powers over domestic policy, leaving foreign affairs and security to Copenhagen. Greenland took full control of its economy, including the mineral and hydrocarbon resources, while remaining, like the Faroe Islands (another former colony lying between Denmark and Iceland) part of the ""Danish realm"". Fights with European environmentalists about seal and whale hunting and fishing rights had already prompted Greenland to quit the European Union, though Denmark remains an EU member.|||Nuuk is at once a capital city and a village. The jumble of pretty clapboard houses rising up from the rocks above the harbour gives way to a sprawl of flimsy, badly worn apartment blocks that might have been designed by an architect of the Soviet school. This is not an elegant town. The 16,000 or so residents are served by a couple of small shopping centres, while a swelling band of business and diplomatic visitors converge on a single hotel. The city's bars are often full - long, dark winter nights, high unemployment and a culture of living-for-the-moment make for a disturbing tradition of heavy drinking. Sisimiut and Ilulissat, the next largest population centres, each have about 5,000 residents. Most Greenlanders live in towns of a thousand or two. In the far north, a typical settlement is home to a hundred or less.|||There are no roads connecting this scattering of communities. The ice and the distances preclude even rudimentary highways. A single vessel of the state-owned shipping line plies its trade up and down the western coastline each week but people and products mostly get around by plane and helicopter. Everything rests on the weather-defying feats of Air Greenland. Given the freezing weather, feats they are. Christian Keldsen, the airline's chief commercial officer, showed me around the hangars at Nuuk airport as a group of engineers stripped down one of half a dozen Dash turboprops. The flying warhorses are built for tough conditions but the mechanics wielded their wrenches with surgical care. Everything is checked, double checked and then checked again, every nut and bolt scrupulously accounted for. The brutal conditions facing the pilots leave no room for mistakes.|||An hour to the north, Kangerlussuaq serves as Air Greenland's communications hub and the country's lifeline to the outside world. Built by the Americans, the runway is one of only two long enough for long-range jets. For most of the year the airline runs a daily service to Copenhagen. A ramshackle cluster of shops and homes assembled in wood and corrugated steel stands in dismal relief to the dazzling mountains that rise from the runway. In winter, temperatures here drop below -40C. A rickety hotel beside the single terminal is a reminder that even the sturdiest of aircraft must sometimes bow to the forces of nature.|||The precariousness of this life - the mainstays of the economy are fishing and a small, though burgeoning tourism industry, and more than half of the government budget comes in the form of a subsidy from Copenhagen - has not dampened the enthusiasm of local politicians for independence. Economy minister Qujaukitsoq says climate warming gives the country the chance to ""create our own economy - firstly by rebuilding our fishing industry, secondly by creating a mining industry and thirdly with tourism"". Lest anyone think there is a shortage of riches, he reels them off: ""gold, silver, platinum, palladium, zinc, iron, copper, rare earths, lead, to name just a few we know for certain Greenland has in large quantities"".|||Kirkegaard, the mining minister, welcomes the world's attention. The government has lifted a decades-old ban on the mining of uranium which had applied even when the material was collected as an unavoidable byproduct. The Australian-based Greenland Minerals and Energy describes the move as a ""transformative event"" which opens up huge potential for the mining of rare earths in southern Greenland. Kirkegaard says the timing for such developments is perfect - the demand for resources from the swelling middle classes of the emerging nations comes at the moment an investor spotlight has turned to the Arctic. There are plenty of other places with untapped resources but ""Greenland is strategically in a good place. The rule of law applies. It is a democratic country where you can trust the courts and laws. That's important for mining companies."" It will take time to locate the oil and gas reserves but Shell, Maersk, Statoil and Cairn Energy are among companies with drilling licences. For now, says Kirkegaard, ""You know it's there, but not quite where.""|||. . .|||There is a Klondike quality about all this. Every summer a pilgrimage of prospectors arrives in search of gold, silver, diamond and ruby deposits. Some of them stay. In Nuuk, Joshua Hughes, a Welsh-born geologist, took me to lunch. He had been visiting Greenland for years, he explained, before deciding to settle in the capital. He is a man with the gleam of riches in his eye. As chief geologist for NunaMinerals, Hughes has been digging for gold; and he is sure he has discovered it. Nuna, he says, has found a valuable seam in southern Greenland, and is raising funds on the Toronto Stock Exchange to finance commercial exploitation.|||Greenland's future, though, may hang on one big deal. The British-based London Mining heads a consortium that wants to establish an iron ore mine at Isua, 100 miles north of Nuuk. Once in operation, this single project would have an output worth a staggering $2bn a year - equivalent to Greenland's present national income. To build the facility and a nearby deep-sea port, London Mining plans to bring in Chinese capital and up to 3,000 Chinese workers. Surveys and negotiations have dragged on over years but 2013 saw a breakthrough in talks with the government. In what Kirkegaard terms a ""historic moment"", London Mining secured a 30-year licence to exploit the ore.|||More cautious voices say ministers are getting carried away by such heady optimism. The government's nationalist rhetoric, diplomats say, collides with some harsh realities. Greenland lacks the infrastructure, the people and the resources to rush into independence. If Denmark was once a rapacious colonial power, Greenland now depends on Copenhagen's financial benevolence. There are questions too about Aleqa Hammond, the feisty leader of the Simuit party, who won this year's general election to become Greenland's first woman prime minister. Hammond, local business leaders observe, looked a more convincing figure on the campaign trail than in government. Some draw unflattering comparisons between Hammond and Kuupik Kleist, her predecessor and the leader of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party. Kleist earned a reputation as a ""grown-up"", a politician brave enough to take unpopular decisions to sort out the public finances and modernise an outdated fishing industry.|||For all its commitment to independence the government struggles to shake off an air of amateurism - a sense that inexperienced ministers have not quite grasped the complexities and risks of the geopolitical game now being played in the Arctic. Much of the work of administration still falls to officials born or trained in Denmark, while, perversely, Hammond's vote-winning pledges have increased Greenland's financial dependence on Copenhagen.|||Kleist's Inuit Ataqatigiit party spearheaded calls for independence during the 1970s and 1980s and he remains committed to the goal. But he warns that the country lacks the financial and human capital to cut itself adrift any time soon. The problems lie not only in numbers - though finding the people to govern a state from a population of only 56,000 will never be easy - but in low educational attainment and high unemployment. Nuuk boasts a small, bustling university but many children leave school with only minimal qualifications. There is no point, Kleist says, ""in yelling in the streets for independence if you do not know how to get there"". Climate change carries opportunities - everything has been moving north, including valuable fish stocks, but you have to build ""your own nation to be strong enough to take care of itself"".|||The cold rush throws up a profound paradox. The world's rediscovery of the Arctic, like Egede's landing in Greenland, promises economic and social upheaval. Climate change threatens to elbow aside what remains of the precious traditions honoured in Daniel Thorleifsen's museum. The number of native hunters in Greenland's high north has fallen to less than a thousand. They are growing old and, as the ice melts, their children are moving south.|||Climate change offers a platform for independence but it will not turn back history. It will more likely force Greenlanders to decide who they are. Centuries of intermingling and intermarriage have blurred the boundary between Greenlandic and Inuit. Greenlanders of mixed or mostly Danish heritage say they too would like independence but they don't look to the past for their future. There are those in Hammond's government who say it is time to close the colonial chapter by retiring Egede from his towering vantage point. The irony is they are not at all sure what they would put in his place.|||-------------------------------------------|||Philip Stephens is the FT's chief political commentator.

"Travel: A feast in the Faroes: There's more to New Nordic Cuisine than Noma. In the wild north Atlantic, Faroe Islands' chefs are elevating traditional foods to another level, discovers Michael Booth",Denmark,"The weather is as volatile as a toddler having a tantrum. Thank god we're not in a helicopter, I think to myself as the plane banks on its final approach and a cluster of snow-covered island-mountains erupting from the sea loom through the storm clouds.|||This Nordic Hawaii is the Faroe Islands. Forget Copenhagen, or even Reykjavik, I'd heard this cluster of 18 rocky islands in the middle of the north Atlantic, inhabited by 50,000 descendants of Norse renegades, is the new frontier in the new Nordic food movement. A place where a tiny band of determined pioneers, led by one visionary chef, is developing a radical, contemporary cuisine from the most meagre culinary heritage.|||An hour or so after landing, it seems I spoke too soon about the helicopter: it is the only way to reach the island of Stora Dimun, home to a couple of hundred sheep and the Petersen family's farm, my first destination in a three-day tour of the islands' nascent food scene. First challenge is to reach the helicopter which is idling on what is, essentially, an ice rink. With my arms occupied by luggage and a woolly hat, I am at the mercy of both natural and man-made gales. For every step forward I slide two back. In the end, a fellow passenger comes to my rescue and drags me backwards on my heels like a shop dummy.|||I assume he is a birdwatcher, like so many visitors to the Faroes, but the duffle-coated samaritan turns out to be John Gynther from the experimental cheese division (really) of a Danish dairy products company, on his way to check on the progress of some cheeses.|||""The humidity here is perfect for maturing cheeses, but nobody has tried it before,"" he tells me. ""If it's successful, I hope some of the best restaurants in the world will give it to their guests. It'll be the true taste of the north Atlantic, expressed in a cheese.""|||Arriving safely at the Petersen's farm, I hear a little about their lives. Their forefathers have farmed sheep here for over 200 years. That little black tar cottage over there is the children's schoolhouse; a teacher arrives every Monday and stays in the attic. And those chocolate dots inching across the sheer hillside are their sheep, whose coats have evolved a yeti-like shagginess over the centuries.|||Jogva Jon Petersen shows us into the hjallur, a wooden shed with vented walls where the sheep carcasses are hung by their feet to dry in the wind, flayed like some macabre art installation. This is the Faroe's famous raest mutton, he explains, semi-dried and fermented in the sea air. Dangling alongside is Gynther's cheese, which we taste in Jogva's low-ceilinged kitchen as his kids bring to the table their treasured toys and, at one point, a pet rabbit. The cheese is good, resembling a bitter manchego. The raest is chewy like thick-cut pata negra ham, with a strong flavour only just the right side of ""sheepy"" for me.|||That evening, in the islands' capital, Torshavn, we eat in what appears to be a Hobbit dwelling but is actually a cosy, turf-roofed cottage housing a restaurant, Aarstova (+298 333000, Aarstova.fo, dinner from about pounds 55). We dip our heads to enter and are confronted with another dried sheep carcass flayed on a fancy, turned-wood stand. They're not squeamish, the Faroese - as evidenced by the annual summer pilot whale slaughter, the grindadrap, which apparently has something of a family festival air (though obviously not for the whales, which are slaughtered despite being so riddled with mercury that since 2008 the island's medical officers have recommended they are no longer considered fit for human consumption).|||We are presented with a dor schnapps. This is my new favourite Faroese tradition: when arriving at a party or, sometimes, a restaurant, guests are presented with a glass of schnapps, refilled communion wine-style for new arrivals. We sit alongside a man called Mortan, who is one of life's enthusiasts. He insists we try some raest mutton paired with amontillado sherry, and there is an unexpected repartee between the wine's oaky notes and the rich mutton. The geographical connection is not all that tenuous either, Mortan points out, given that for centuries the Faroese exported salt cod to Spain.|||The talk turns to the islands' long-mooted independence from Denmark and the oil that many believe lurks offshore and could lift the Faroes' economy - which as far as I can make out is kept afloat by the Sarah Lund sweaters, made here by Gudrun and Gudrun (gudrungudrun.com), a company founded and run by two Faroese women, and sold in a shop on the harbourfront. As the schnapps bottles are drained, the tables are cleared for traditional dancing . . . national dress optional.|||The next morning the Faroes fling another of their elemental challenges at us. We are to rendezvous at sea with the island's most highly prized catch: langoustines. From my room in the surprisingly hip Hotel Foroyar on the hillside above the capital, the sea looks more white than blue and I prepare to disgrace myself with all manner of uncontrollable bodily eructations as our boat heaves and plunges out into the fjord. A harrowing hour or so later, we come within hollering distance of our fisherman. He is bucking like a bronco in his bathtub boat, yet manages to toss us a live langoustine the length of my forearm. One of our party rips its plump, still-twitching tail from its body, and passes it to me to suck its ocean-sweet flesh. For a moment I forget the motion of the boat.|||The langoustines make an appearance that evening, cooked this time, during a meal that evokes the food traditions we have seen over the past two days, yet also referencing the avant-garde kitchens of Denmark and Spain. Already on the table when we arrive, for example, is a large, dried cod's spine - a memorable piece of gastronomic melodrama that serves as a rack for crispy fried cod skins.|||The foraged herbs, driftwood plates and powdered seaweeds are all recognisable New Nordic themes but I haven't eaten like this anywhere else: this is food born from a survival imperative, refined for pure pleasure. We're at Restaurant Koks (+298 333 999, koks.fo, from pounds 50 for four courses), a name unfortunate to English ears, though the word is Faroese for flirt or fusspot. All the produce, bar the odd dash of white wine or vanilla, is harvested, caught, shot or cultivated on or around the islands.|||""My cuisine is a mirror of the nature of the Faroes,"" chef Leif Sorensen tells me after the meal.|||I first met Sorensen when he gave a talk at the MAD food festival in Copenhagen in 2012 that left the audience awed by his self-imposed challenges. Sorensen, a serious man of few, but well chosen, words, explained how he had returned to the Faroes after working in Michelin-starred kitchens in Copenhagen, wanting to discover what his home islands had to offer. On this evening it included the most blueberry-ish blueberries I'd ever tasted; sweet, soft deep-sea mussels; wild angelica; and a parade of dried shrimps whose super-intense flavour haunts me (in a good way) to this day.|||""I kind of had to live up to my own manifesto,"" Leif told me, referring to 2004's now famous New Nordic Manifesto, of which he was a signatory. ""The ambition was to do something different, to make it possible to eat a little better food here, to try to change the restaurant environment. It was difficult to get raw materials because they weren't allowed to sell the lamb or fish to restaurants. It was hopeless. I started to go out and collect plants, and that was the beginning.""|||There was virtually no restaurant culture on the Faroes before Leif started Koks five years ago: it was illegal to serve alcohol in restaurants until 1992. But new places are emerging in its wake, such as sushi restaurant Etika (+298 319319, etika.fo; from about pounds 25), which uses only locally caught fish, and the restaurant at the Hotel Hafnia (+298 313233, hafnia.fo, three courses pounds 50).|||There's a new artisanal brewery, Okkara (okkara.fo), and an increasing number of food events. For example, at the Faroe Bank Cod dinner at Aarstova every March, the Faroese Fisheries Laboratory's research annual catch of this otherwise protected species is cooked and served. By all accounts (OK, mainly Mortan's), it is the finest cod in the world.|||The locals were sceptical about Koks at first. Some were aghast that their subsistence ingredients, such as raest and puffin, were being served for foreign visitors. But Faroese now make up around half of Koks' guests, the rest coming mainly from Scandinavia, but also growing numbers from as far afield as Japan and Brazil.|||Yet, as Leif tells me wearily, the challenges of running an avant garde restaurant on the fringes of the Arctic remain borderline insurmountable, and aren't limited to produce supply chains. ""My staff can earn twice as much catching fish as they can cooking it,"" he sighs, looking more exhausted than any man I have ever seen.|||Frankly, the Faroes are exhausting. But they are also exhilarating. I hear they appear through the mists from time to time, like Brigadoon. Next time they do, you should go.|||* The trip was provided by the Faroe Islands tourist board (visitfaroeislands.com) and Hotel Foroyar (+298 31 75 00, hotelforoyar.fo, doubles from pounds 205).

There are emerging fisheries and hidden minerals. Cruise liners loaded with tourists are sailing the Arctic’s frigid waters in increasing numbers. Cargo traffic along the Northern Sea Route, one of two shortcuts across the top of the Earth in summer, is on the rise.|||The U.S., which takes over the two-year rotating chairmanship of the eight-nation Arctic Council in 2015, has not ignored the Arctic, but critics say the U.S. is lagging behind the seven others: Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Canada and Denmark, through the semiautonomous territory of Greenland.|||“On par with the other Arctic nations, we are behind — behind in our thinking, behind in our vision,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. “We lack basic infrastructure, basic funding commitments to be prepared for the level of activity expected in the Arctic.”|||At a meeting before Thanksgiving with Secretary of State John Kerry, Murkowski suggested he name a U.S. ambassador or envoy to the Arctic — someone who could coordinate work on the Arctic being done by more than 20 federal agencies and take the lead on increasing U.S. activities in the region.|||Murkowski is trying to get Americans to stop thinking that the Arctic is just Alaska’s concern.|||The melting Arctic also is creating a new front of U.S. security concerns.

"Northern lights; Constitutional innovation? Unnecessary sovereignty? A new Klondike? Columnist Doug Saunders convenes The Globe's own ‘Arctic circle' to consider the perceptions, risks, responsibilities and even the language of Canada's relationship with its land and peoples in the North. Some of their answers may surprise you",Denmark,"'FROZEN TREASURE CHEST'|||Doug Saunders: Just 100,000 Canadians – about 0.3 per cent of us – live in the three northern territories. What do southerners most misunderstand about the Canadian North?|||Mary Simon: I would like more Canadians to understand and value what it means to be an “Arctic nation.” Some years ago, when I was president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (Canada's national Inuit organization), I toured the country making presentations to Canadians on why the Arctic matters. The Canadian Arctic is the homeland of Inuit and other aboriginal peoples, and comprises a large part of the geography of our country. It is not, as a former minister of Indian Affairs mused, our “frozen treasure chest.”|||There is no other region in Canada that faces the breadth of complex environmental, social and political issues found today in the Arctic. Like all Canadians, Inuit are working hard to feed our families and live comfortably, and we want our children to succeed in school and find meaningful work. To achieve a lifestyle comparable to other Canadians, Inuit must be involved and truly benefit from resource development, and not at the cost of the environment that families still draw a livelihood around.|||Tony Penikett: The 20 or so northern land-claims settlements negotiated since 1973. Few Canadians realize the scale of these treaties. For 7,000 First Nations people in the Yukon, the treaties recognize title to 41,000 square kilometres (along with subsurface rights on two-thirds of that land), which is more land than is contained in all the Indian reserves in all of Southern Canada. And the Nunavut treaty made the Inuit there the largest private landowners in the world, with title to 350,000 square kilometres.|||The text of the Yukon treaty is longer than the New Testament. Canadians, it is said, do not want constitutional change, but in the territories, the changes have been enormous, all as the result of bottom-up innovation from aboriginal and territorial government leaders. Yukon aboriginal self-government agreements give First Nations quasi-provincial powers and were the model for settlements with the Nisga'a and others in B.C. and the Northwest Territories. But NWT First Nations have also experimented with regional shared governance arrangements with municipal authorities.|||As Simon Fraser professor Doug McArthur has written: “There is a new constitutional settlement in the North.” And nobody in the South knows much about it.|||Wade Davis: Canadians forget how recently European contact convulsed the lives of the Inuit … This, then, is the tragedy and perhaps the inspiration of the Arctic. A people that have endured so much – epidemic disease, the humiliation and violence of the residential schools, the culture of poverty inherent in the welfare system, drug and alcohol exposure leading to suicide rates six times that of Southern Canada – now, on the very eve of their emergence as a culture reborn, politically, socially, and psychologically – find themselves confronted by a force beyond their capacity to resist. The ice is melting, and with it, quite possibly a way of life.|||For most Canadians, climate change is seen as a technical and scientific challenge, distant from their lives. The Inuit live its reality every day. They are a people of the ice. As hunters, they depend on it for their survival, even as it inspires the very essence of their character and culture.|||Indeed, it is the very nature of ice, the way it moves, recedes, dissolves and reforms with the seasons, that gives such flexibility to the Inuit heart and spirit. They have no illusions of permanence. There is no time for regret. Despair is an insult to the imagination. Their grocery store is out there on the land. To live, they must kill the things they most love. Blood on ice in the Arctic is not a sign of death but an affirmation of life. Death is the disappearance of the ice. Climate change for the Inuit is not an environmental or political issue, but rather an issue of cultural survival, with profound psychological and indeed spiritual implications.|||'SOBER THOUGHTS'|||Doug Saunders: In recent years, the North has taken on a new political and economic prominence in Canada. Will this create a new era of prosperity and independence for northern communities, or does it bring a risk of exploitation and damage to communities and environments?|||Michael Byers: Despite the increased media attention, Canada lags far behind other Arctic countries in seizing the opportunities presented by rising resource prices and retreating sea ice. Russia generates more than 20 per cent of its GDP from the Arctic. Norway profits from being the world leader in the high-tech field of Arctic oil and gas. Iceland has turned itself into a global tourist destination.|||As for Canada, consider this: Despite having the longest coastline of any of the Arctic countries, our most northern port is at Churchill – in Manitoba. Balancing economic development, local governance and environmental protection will never be easy. But serious investments in infrastructure – including a port at Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut – would be a good start.|||Shelagh Grant: As a historian, the excitement and hyperbole attached to the prospect of extensive mineral and fossil fuel development in the Canadian North reminds me of the promises associated with the building of the CPR and the Yukon Gold Rush. While the potential for new economic development is indeed exciting, second sober thoughts should consider the consequences for the predominately indigenous northern communities.|||For anyone who has visited an open-pit mine in the North, the ecological consequences are obvious. Although oil and gas developments are surprisingly less detrimental to the environment, the risks of a major oil spill could be catastrophic. Yet far too often, environmental issues gain more publicity than the more subtle social and economic questions.|||Most northern communities are led to believe that new mining developments will create new job opportunities and profits for local industries. But this has not happened with the Raglan Mine on the Ungava shores of Northern Quebec.|||Dare I suggest that what Canada needs is a leader who can convince all Canadians that it's in their best interest to make an extraordinary investment in the infrastructure and educational opportunities in the Far North to ensure that the future prosperity of our country. Otherwise, Northern Canada risks becoming an abandoned sand box after the large corporations have extracted all the treasures of any value.|||'HUMAN FLAGPOLES'|||Doug Saunders: “Arctic sovereignty” has become a key catchphrase in media and politics, and many people believe that investments and military expansions are required to maintain or stake Canadian sovereignty. How important is this?|||John English: A few years ago, I was involved in a publishing project and was told that “Arctic sovereignty” had to be in the title, because it sells best. A casual scan of Canadian book titles quickly confirms the publisher's argument. It does “flare up” suddenly, as when the Manhattan and Polar Sea incidents apparently threatened Canada's Arctic claims, but the debates generate more confusion than clarity about the character of Canada's Arctic presence. Too often, “Arctic sovereignty” becomes the first refuge of political scoundrels who obscure the very real challenges facing Arctic communities, and the 1950s sovereignty flare-up in which Inuit families became “human flagpoles” is an appalling example of abuse.|||The Arctic Council contains two military superpowers, and Canada cannot hope to compete with them militarily. As long as others have a significant Arctic military presence, we must respond with better ships, planes and ports than we currently have. We also need to invest in our northern communities and assure that the Arctic Council, which was primarily a Canadian creation, remains the effective multilateral forum for Arctic states.|||Rob Huebert: Many will also contend that these are only diplomatic issues that are already well in hand. The logic that flows from such a view is that there really is not much needed to be spent on defence of Canadian Arctic sovereignty and that the resources would be better spent elsewhere.|||I would argue that this is not a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the issue. Defending Canadian Arctic sovereignty is not only about defining the borders and international legal status of the Canadian North – though it is often the first step that is necessary. It is really about the control of the region.|||Thus, I believe that, in order to protect the long-term interests of northerners and southerners, Canada does need the equipment, training, and personnel to ultimately defend and protect and enforce our interests, values and rules.|||Michael Byers: Canada's sovereignty is uncontested within 99.99 per cent of the territory we claim as our own, with the exception being tiny Hans Island – which Denmark also claims. Our two other Arctic disputes involve the maritime domain.|||Resolving these disputes is not a question of money or military power. A quarter of a century after the Cold War ended, we live in a deeply integrated, truly global economy. Denmark is part of the European Union, with which Canada recently negotiated a free-trade agreement. Canada is the United States's largest trading partner. And Russia, the newest member of the WTO, has an oil-and-gas-based economy that is heavily dependent on foreign capital, technology and markets.|||In the circumstances, there is no question of a “fight” over Arctic sovereignty, apart from a fight between lawyers. Although there are good reasons to spend money in the Arctic, sovereignty – legally defined – is not one of them.|||'GETTING OFF CHEAP'|||Doug Saunders: What are the challenges and responsibilities for the future of northern peoples? What do we say to those who believe that Ottawa should not be subsidizing remote communities to the extent that we do?|||Tony Penikett: As I understand it, the complaint is that Canadians subsidize each Nunavummiut to the tune of something like $32,000 a year. That means each Canadian contributes about $30 a year to support Nunavut. But, as is often said, since the Cold War-era relocations to Ellesmere Island, the Inuit of Nunavut have been the human flagpoles of Canadian sovereignty and Arctic security.|||The United States bases 25,000 armed-forces personnel in Alaska at a likely cost of about $100 or more a year per American. Nunavummiut suffer the highest food, housing and energy prices in Canada – in other words, extreme food insecurity and seriously overcrowded homes. And since Canada's military presence in the Arctic remains light on the ground, maybe Canada is getting off cheap and our flagpoles deserve more support.|||Mary Simon: Can we not at least agree that Canadians, along with other northern nations, understand that distance, small populations and cultural diversity are part of our national character and part of what makes us a polar nation? I also want to say that the “remoteness” of Arctic communities is outdated thinking in an age of daily air travel and Internet connectivity.|||As the late Jose Kusugak once said, Inuit view themselves as “First Canadians, Canadians First,” and we want to be full contributors to Canada. Thoughtful development of Arctic resources will attract investment in Canada, create employment for Canadians, pay royalties to governments and Inuit, and buy goods and services from the provinces.|||We are trying to accomplish in the North in two generations what Canada has done in other regions in six generations. To the critics, we say this: Canada is a polar nation. Realizing the possibilities of the Arctic region and its people will take more time and necessitates the long view that a country with 150 years of nation-building experience should understand.|||********|||PANELISTS|||Mary Simon has served as Canada's first ambassador for circumpolar affairs, as president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and as lead negotiator for the creation of the Arctic Council.|||Tony Penikett was NDP premier of Yukon from 1985 to 1992, and the Nunavut's chief devolution negotiator until 2012.|||Wade Davis is an anthropologist, ethnobotanist, explorer, photographer, filmmaker and author of 20 books focusing on remote and endangered cultures.

"G2: THE DARK HEART OF SCANDINAVIA: Forget what you've heard about the 'Scandinavian miracle'. Television in Denmark is rubbish, Finnish men like a drink - and Sweden is not always a model of democracy. Why, asks sometime Denmark resident Michael Booth, does everybody think the Nordic region is some sort of utopia on earth?",Denmark,"For the past few years the world has been in thrall to all things Nordic (for which purpose we must of course add Iceland and Finland to the Viking nations of Denmark, Norway and Sweden).

Enough with foraging for dinner. Enough with the impractical minimalist interiors. Enough with the envious reports on the abolition of gender-specific pronouns. Enough of the unblinking idolatry of all things knitted, bearded, rye bread-based and licorice-laced. It is time to redress the imbalance, shed a little light Beyond the Wall.|||Take the Danes, for instance. True, they claim to be the happiest people in the world, but why no mention of the fact they are second only to Iceland when it comes to consuming anti-|||depressants? And Sweden? If, as a headline in this paper once claimed, it is ""the most successful society the world has ever seen"", why aren't more of you dreaming of ""a little place"" in Umea?|||Actually, I have lived in Denmark - on and off - for about a decade, because my wife's work is here (and she's Danish). Life here is pretty comfortable, more so for indigenous families than for immigrants or ambitious|||go-getters (Google ""Jantelov"" for more on this), but as with all the Nordic|||nations, it remains largely free of armed conflict, extreme poverty,|||natural disasters and Jeremy Kyle.|||So let's remove those rose-tinted ski goggles and take a closer look at the|||objects of our infatuation . . .|||DENMARK|||Why do the Danes score so highly on international happiness surveys? Well, they do have high levels of trust and social cohesion, and do very nicely from industrial pork products, but|||according to the OECD they also work fewer hours per year than most of|||the rest of the world. As a result,|||productivity is worryingly sluggish. How can they afford all those expensively foraged meals and hand-knitted woollens? Simple, the Danes also have the highest level of private debt in the world (four times as much as the Italians, to put it into context; enough to warrant a warning from the IMF), while more than half of them admit to using the black market to obtain goods and services.|||Perhaps the Danes' dirtiest secret is that, according to a 2012 report from the Worldwide Fund for Nature, they have the fourth largest per capita ecological footprint in the world. Even ahead of the US. Those offshore windmills may look impressive as you land at Kastrup, but Denmark is the EU's largest exporter of oil, and it still burns an awful lot of coal. Worth bearing that in mind the next time a Dane wags her finger at your patio heater.|||I'm afraid I have to set you straight on Danish television too. Their big new drama series, Arvingerne (The Legacy, when it comes to BBC4 later this year) is stunning, but the reality of prime-time Danish TV is day-to-day, wall-to-wall reruns of 15-year-old episodes of Midsomer Murders and documentaries on pig welfare. The Danes of course also have highest taxes in the world (though only the sixth-highest wages - hence the debt, I guess). As a spokesperson I interviewed at the Danish centre-right thinktank Cepos put it, they effectively work until Thursday lunchtime for the state's coffers, and the other day and half for themselves.|||Presumably the correlative of this is that Denmark has the best public services? According to the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment rankings (Pisa), Denmark's schools lag behind even the UK's. Its health service is buckling too. (The other day, I turned up at my local A&E; to be told that I had to make an appointment, which I can't help feeling rather misunderstands the nature of the service.) According to the World Cancer Research Fund, the Danes have the highest cancer rates on the planet. ""But at least the trains run on time!"" I hear you say. No, that was Italy under Mussolini. The Danish national rail company has skirted bankruptcy in recent years, and the trains most assuredly do not run on time. Somehow, though, the government still managed to find pounds 2m to fund a two-year tax-scandal investigation largely concerned, as far as I can make out, with the sexual orientation of the prime minister's husband, Stephen Kinnock.|||Most seriously of all, economic equality - which many believe is the foundation of societal success - is decreasing. According to a report in Politiken this month, the proportion of people below the poverty line has doubled over the last decade. Denmark is becoming a nation divided, essentially, between the places which have a branch of Sticks'n'Sushi (Copenhagen) and the rest. Denmark's provinces have become a social dumping ground for non-western immigrants, the elderly, the unemployed and the unemployable who live alongside Denmark's 22m intensively farmed pigs, raised 10 to a pen and pumped full of antibiotics (the pigs, that is).|||Other awkward truths? There is more than a whiff of the police state about the fact that Danish policeman refuse to display ID numbers and can refuse to give their names. The Danes are aggressively jingoistic, waving their red-and-white dannebrog at the slightest provocation. Like the Swedes, they embraced privatisation with great enthusiasm (even the ambulance service is privatised); and can seem spectacularly unsophisticated in their race relations (cartoon depictions of black people with big lips and bones through their noses are not uncommon in the national press). And if you think a move across the North Sea would help you escape the paedophiles, racists, crooks and tax-dodging corporations one reads about in the British media on a daily basis, I'm afraid I must disavow you of that too. Got plenty of them.|||Plus side? No one talks about cricket.|||NORWAY|||The dignity and resolve of the Norwegian people in the wake of the attacks by Anders Behring Breivik in July 2011 was deeply impressive, but in September the rightwing, anti-Islamist Progress party - of which Breivik had been an active member for many years - won 16.3% of the vote in the general election, enough to elevate it into coalition government for the first time in its history. There remains a disturbing Islamophobic sub-subculture in Norway. Ask the Danes, and they will tell you that the Norwegians are the most insular and xenophobic of all the Scandinavians, and it is true that since they came into a bit of money in the 1970s the Norwegians have become increasingly Scrooge-like, hoarding their gold, fearful of outsiders.|||Though 2013 saw a record number of asylum applications to Norway, it granted asylum to fewer than half of them (around 5,000 people), a third of the number that less wealthy Sweden admits (Sweden accepted over 9,000 from Syria alone). In his book Petromania, journalist Simon Saetre warns that the powerful oil lobby is ""isolating us and making the country asocial"". According to him, his countrymen have been corrupted by their oil money, are working less, retiring earlier, and calling in sick more frequently. And while previous governments have controlled the spending of oil revenues, the new bunch are threatening a splurge which many warn could lead to full-blown Dutch disease.|||Like the dealer who never touches his own supply, those dirty frackers the Norwegians boast of using only renewable energy sources, all the while amassing the world's largest sovereign wealth fund selling fossil fuels to the rest of us. As Norwegian anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen put it to me when I visited his office in Oslo University: ""We've always been used to thinking of ourselves as part of the solution, and with the oil we suddenly became part of the problem. Most people are really in denial.""|||ICELAND|||We need not detain ourselves here too long. Only 320,000 - it would appear rather greedy and irresponsible -|||people cling to this breathtaking, yet borderline uninhabitable rock in the North Atlantic. Further attention will only encourage them.|||FINLAND|||I am very fond of the Finns, a most pragmatic, redoubtable people with a Sahara-dry sense of humour. But would I want to live in Finland? In summer, you'll be plagued by mosquitos, in winter, you'll freeze - that's assuming no one shoots you, or you don't shoot yourself. Finland ranks third in global gun ownership behind only America and Yemen; has the highest murder rate in western Europe, double that of the UK; and by far the highest suicide rate in the Nordic countries.|||The Finns are epic Friday-night bingers and alcohol is now the leading cause of death for Finnish men. ""At some point in the evening around 11.30pm, people start behaving aggressively, throwing punches, wrestling,"" Heikki Aittokoski, foreign editor of Helsingin Sanomat, told me. ""The next day, people laugh about it. In the US, they'd have an intervention.""|||With its tarnished crown jewel, Nokia, devoured by Microsoft,|||Finland's hitherto robust economy is more dependent than ever on selling paper - mostly I was told, to Russian porn barons. Luckily, judging by a recent journey I took with my eldest son the length of the country by train, the place appears to be 99% trees. The view was a bit samey.|||The nation once dubbed ""the west's reigning educational superpower""|||(the Atlantic) has slipped in the latest|||Pisa rankings. This follows some|||unfortunate incidents involving Finnish students - the burning of Porvoo|||cathedral by an 18-year-old in 2006; the Jokela shootings (another disgruntled 18-year-old) in 2007, and the shooting of 10 more students by a peer in 2008 - which led some to speculate whether Finnish schools were quite as wonderful as their reputation would have us believe.|||If you do decide to move there, don't expect scintillating conversation. Finland's is a reactive, listening culture, burdened by taboos too many to mention (civil war, second world war and cold war-related, mostly). They're not big on chat. Look up the word ""reticent"" in the dictionary and you won't find a picture of an awkward Finn standing in a corner looking at his shoelaces, but you should.|||""We would always prefer to be alone,"" a Finnish woman once admitted to me. She worked for the tourist board.|||SWEDEN|||Anything I say about the Swedes will pale in comparison to their own excoriating self-image. A few years ago, the Swedish Institute of Public Opinion Research asked young Swedes to describe their compatriots. The top eight adjectives they chose were: envious, stiff, industrious, nature loving, quiet, honest, dishonest, xenophobic.|||I met with Ake Daun, Sweden's most venerable ethnologist. ""Swedes seem not to 'feel as strongly' as certain other people"", Daun writes in his excellent book, Swedish Mentality. ""Swedish women try to moan as little as possible during childbirth and they often ask, when it is all over, whether they screamed very much. They are very pleased to be told they did not."" Apparently, crying at funerals is frowned upon and ""remembered long afterwards"". The Swedes are, he says, ""highly adept at insulating themselves from each other"". They will do anything to avoid sharing a lift with a stranger, as I found out during a day-long experiment behaving as un-Swedishly as possible in Stockholm.|||Effectively a one-party state - albeit supported by a couple of shadowy industrialist families - for much of the 20th century, ""neutral"" Sweden (one of the world largest arms exporters) continues to thrive economically thanks to its distinctive brand of totalitarian modernism, which curbs freedoms, suppresses dissent in the name of consensus, and seems hell-bent on severing the bonds between wife and husband, children and parents, and elderly on their children. Think of it as the China of the north.|||Youth unemployment is higher than the UK's and higher than the EU average; integration is an ongoing challenge; and as with Norway and Denmark, the Swedish right is on the rise. A spokesman for the Sweden Democrats (currently at an all-time high of close to 10% in the polls) insisted to me that immigrants were ""more prone to violence"". I pointed out that Sweden was one of the most bloodthirsty nations on earth for much of the last millennium. I was told we'd run out of time.|||Ask the Finns and they will tell you that Swedish ultra-feminism has emasculated their men, but they will struggle to drown their sorrows. Their state-run alcohol monopoly stores, the dreaded Systembolaget, were described by Susan Sontag as ""part funeral parlour, part back-room abortionist"".|||The myriad successes of the Nordic countries are no miracle, they were born of a combination of Lutheran modesty, peasant parsimony, geographical determinism and ruthless pragmatism (""The Russians are attacking? Join the Nazis! The Nazis are losing? Join the Allies!""). These societies function well for those who conform to the collective median, but they aren't much fun for tall poppies. Schools reign in higher achievers for the sake of the less gifted; ""elite"" is a dirty word; displays of success, ambition or wealth are frowned upon. If you can cope with this, and the cost, and the cold (both metaphorical and inter-personal), then by all means join me in my adopted hyggelige (home). I've rustled up a sorrel salad and there's some expensive, weak beer in the fridge. Pull up an Egg.

"NORDIC CULTURE: The blond leading the blond: This enjoyable survey of all things Nordic finds that our friends in the north are as flawed as we are, writes Oslo-born Mariella Frostrup: The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle Michael Booth Jonathan Cape pounds 14.99, pp416",Denmark,"It's a source of some surprise that despite our proximity to the richest, the most socially advanced and the happiest societies on earth (Norway, Sweden and Denmark respectively), the UK population hasn't chosen to emigrate en masse. Instead, our gaze remains resolutely focused southwards, as constant as this year's rain, whether for sun or snow, diet or quality of life, while our northerly neighbours merit barely a glance. Between them they boast the Nobel prize and Ikea, H&M; and enough crude oil to rival Saudi Arabia, the best education system, the best health service and unrivalled gender equality, but they seldom make headlines.|||On his odyssey among the ""Almost Nearly Perfect People"", British journalist Michael Booth has managed to uncover a few facts of truly tabloid vintage: neutral Sweden is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world, 5% of Danish men have had sex with animals, and 54% of Icelanders believe in elves. None of the latter is likely to increase tourism to the far north, but as the author points out, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark do little to promote themselves.|||One theory about my fellow Scandinavians' reticence to holler about their virtues is that there'd be a stampede if they advertised. It's the only plausible explanation not covered in Michael Booth's comprehensive and occasionally downright hilarious explanation of the Nordic miracle, as imagined by everyone living outside of this social democratic hotspot. Spurred by yet another survey describing his wife's fellow Danes as the happiest people on earth, Booth, a Copenhagen resident, elected to investigate what really makes the Scandinavians tick.|||Dedicating a section to each of the five countries he maintains make up the Nordic bloc, he takes us as deep into the Scandinavian psyche as we're ever likely to want to go; from the Danish addiction to the sterile comforts of hyggelig, or ""cosy times"", to Norwegian isolationism, the Finns' much vaunted sisu, or machismo, the Swedes' obsessive conformity and the Icelandic devil-may-care approach to banking.|||Of my birthplace Booth comments, ""When a man is bored of Oslo. . . he's probably been there three days"", going on to reveal that the Norwegians' biggest hit TV show of recent years isn't from the Nordic noir stable but a seven-hour documentary of a train's real-life progress from Bergen to Oslo with a camera strapped to the front of it!|||Booth's wry eye zooms in on many such characteristics and peccadillos of our closest cousins. By the time he gets to Sweden, commonly regarded as the most perfect nation on earth, and chooses to provoke the uber-conformist population (his conclusion not mine) by committing acts of social terrorism like eating crisps and slurping coke in the Swedish National museum or abandoning all common sense and crossing streets while the lights are still red, I was laughing out loud.|||His companionable, lightly mocking tone remains in place when he veers to the darker extremities, exploring, among much else, the Finnish addiction to anti-psychotic drugs, the Norwegian antisocial tendencies and weird penchant for 19th-century national costume, the Icelandic revenge against the Danes via a suicidal corporate spending spree, and Sweden's questionable freedom of speech credentials when it comes to the far right.|||This amble through Scandiland may be light on any profound conclusion, but it's a lively and endearing portrait of our friends in the north, venerated globally for their perfectly balanced societies but, it turns out, as flawed as the rest of us - or at least only almost perfect.|||To buy The Almost Nearly Perfect People for pounds 11.99 with free UK p&p; call 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk|||Captions:|||Young Swedes, whose compatriots are 'uber-conformist', at midsummer's eve celebrations in Stockholm.

"As the World Warms, Navy Strategists Plan for an Arctic Rush",Denmark,"Approximately 25,000 polar bears live in and around the Arctic Circle. Climate change has put the majestic ursines, a longtime favorite of children’s books and Christmas cards, in peril. In 2008, the United States listed them as a “threatened species” under the Endangered Species Act, and populations have been on the decline since then.|||So when is it acceptable for a Marine to shoot one? The Navy is still trying to figure that out.|||Walter Berbrick, a retired Navy officer and a professor of war games at the U.S. Naval War College, was conducting the Fleet Arctic Operations Game in 2011, simulating, among other things, how the Navy would respond to an oil spill in the Arctic, when he discovered there were no rules of engagement for polar bears. “You’ve really got to be mindful of where you’re at and where they’re at,” Berbrick says, pointing out that polar bears travel in open waters and on ice floes where naval units would have to operate. “Folks need to be trained and deployed understanding their interaction with polar bears. The Navy needs some kind of specialized force protection training, policies, rules of engagement.|||“It’s something the Navy doesn’t think about or plan for or prepare for, because there hasn’t been a demand for it,” he says. Until now.|||In February, the Navy released the U.S. Navy Arctic Roadmap for 2014 to 2030, a document outlining naval preparations for the region. It doesn’t address rules of engagement for polar bears, but it does lay out various other necessities for Naval capabilities in the Arctic, from new satellite communications equipment to cold-weather training exercises. The Navy’s road map followed the Department of Defense’s “Arctic Strategy” report of November 2013 and the White House’s May 2013 “National Security Strategy for the Arctic Region.” The documents make up a nascent Arctic strategy.|||As global warming melts Arctic ice, the region is being opened to increased commercial activity like shipping, mining and drilling. And along with human activity comes foreign policy and military strategy. Strategists in the Navy and throughout the government are scrambling to put policies in place, develop technology and create a plan of action for this burgeoning region of commercial activity.|||A Very Chilly Canary|||The Arctic covers some 5.5 million square miles: 8 percent of the earth’s surface and 15 percent of its total landmass. Eight countries—Russia, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Iceland and the United States—have territory that extends into the Arctic Circle. About 13 million people live within the Arctic Circle, around 7 million fewer than in the New York City metropolitan area. That’s because the Arctic has some of harshest climates on the planet: Temperatures dip to -50 F in the winter.|||Human-made climate change affects the whole world, but the Arctic is feeling its impact more quickly and dramatically than elsewhere. The Arctic is “global warming’s canary in the coal mine,” in the words of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Since 1978, the winter Arctic ice cap—the complete ice coverage that lasts through the winter and recedes in the summer—has shrunk by 12 percent every decade. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted melting Arctic ice as one of the first serious casualties of global warming.|||And these changes are happening faster than anyone predicted. “Climate models have consistently underestimated the rate of change in the Arctic,” Jan-Gunnar Winther, the director of the Norwegian Polar Institute, said in a recent interview with an environmental news website. “We must be aware that the future could bring yet more surprises in the region.” In the past year, Arctic sea ice was at the fifth-lowest level since recording began. The lowest level came in 2011.|||Disappearing sea ice is bad news for the planet, but not everyone is mourning. “It’s great if you’re a shipper,” says Laurence Smith, a professor of geography at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the region. Cargo transit through the Russian Arctic Northern Sea Route hit an all-time high in 2013. There’s big money to be made in the Arctic, and climate change is making that possible.|||“The popular perception is that Arctic warming is going to open some treasure trove of resources,” Smith says. That will be true in several industries. Tourism to the region is growing. Warmer waters have increased fish stocks. Offshore oil drilling is expected to boom. The region contains up to 22 percent of the world’s untapped oil and gas deposits. Longer summers and less ice have already given oil companies strong incentives to start exploration.|||Less ice also means more ships. Moving around the North Pole could slash shipping times—and costs—for many countries that would be happy to avoid the Suez or Panama canals. Russia and China in particular have shown interest in northern shipping routes.|||It’s this increased activity that has the Navy looking to plot a course for the frigid region—both to support commercial activity and to be of assistance if there is trouble. Preparations go from grand strategy to the more mundane. If the Navy is to operate seriously in the Arctic, it will need icebreakers, ships that do exactly what their name implies. Other Arctic states have invested heavily in these. Russia has 30, and Canada has 13. The United States has just three, all of which belong to the Coast Guard and are not powerful enough for Arctic operations.|||On the less expensive side of naval preparation are things like writing a new “Cold Weather Operations Handbook,” something the Navy hasn’t updated since 1987, according to Robert Freeman, a public affairs officer at the Navy’s Office of the Oceanographer. The old version is basically useless. For example, the old operations handbook suggests that if sea spray freezes on the outside of a ship, sailors should take a baseball bat to chip it away. That’s not going to work anymore, Freeman says. “In the modern Navy, we have all kinds of very sophisticated and intricate weapons systems on the surface of a ship. You can’t hit them with a baseball bat.”|||But even if there are challenges, there are also tailwinds making the Navy’s life easier. The Arctic remains one of the few areas where international cooperation is the norm rather than the exception. The region is governed through the Arctic Council, a forum in which Arctic states and interested observers iron out issues involving the region, from environmental protection to border disputes. When Russia planted a flag on the North Pole in 2007, many commentators speculated that it would launch a series of land grabs in the world’s least hospitable region. It never came to pass.|||Military-military cooperation abounds, too. U.S. naval officers engage in training exercises with Russian and Norwegian counterparts. The navies of Arctic countries share information and expertise on science and cartography. Even as tensions have flared between Russia and the United States in recent weeks over Ukraine, relations remain good on Arctic issues. “Russia does want to be a partner with the other Arctic states,” says Rear Admiral Jonathan White. “We’re not seeing anything to be concerned about.”|||The reason, according to White and independent Arctic analysts, comes back to money. “All the Arctic nations have things to gain, with additional access to resources, trade routes, fishing and tourism,” White says. “I’m optimistic that we can do it together. But just like any other ocean in the world, we have to be ready.”"
DANGER HERE,Denmark,"An independent Scotland could pose a real risk to the republic's foreign investment and leave Ulster unionists isolated. Should we be worried, asks Stephen O'Brien|||Early in last week's television debate with Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, Alistair Darling went on the attack. Britain's former chancellor of the exchequer wanted to talk about currency and to challenge Salmond's six-year-old claim that an independent Scotland could surpass the Celtic tiger's economic success and become the ""Celtic lion"" of international business and trade.|||Uncertainty about Scotland's link to the pound sterling had helped Darling win the first debate with his opponent in early August, so he pointed across the Irish Sea to what could happen when a government tried to fend off a bank crash without the backing of a big currency and central bank.|||""I know from my experience as chancellor of the exchequer, when I had to deal with the collapse of the banking system in 2008, the security that comes from [governing] a country that was large enough to deal with a collapsing bank,"" he said.|||""My Irish counterpart, my Icelandic counterpart — remember the 'arc of prosperity'? — they weren't so lucky because they weren't big enough.""|||The ""arc of prosperity"" was a phrase coined by Salmond in a speech to Harvard University in March 2008, pointing to a group of thriving independent states — Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden — running in an arc around a becalmed Scotland, stuck in the doldrums, its bountiful oil revenues siphoned off to fuel the British exchequer.|||Tense, shouty and pointing, Darling confronted Salmond with his honeyed words from the past. A relaxed Salmond smiled and grabbed the currency question with both hands, ignoring the Celtic tiger taunt. ""No one can stop us using the pound sterling. It's an internationally tradable currency ... We believe that the best option for Scotland, what I'm seeking a mandate for, is to have the pound sterling,"" he said.|||The audience at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum broke into a round of sustained applause, the first of several for the Scottish National party (SNP)leader in a debate he won comfortably. After months of trailing in the polls and debates, the momentum in Scotland's independence referendum was suddenly with the Yes side with just three weeks to go before polling.|||But should Ireland fear or cheer an independent Scotland? Will Salmond's Celtic lion challenge more aggressively for foreign direct investment (FDI)and tourism revenue, and will Ulster unionists be isolated in a lopsided Britain without their Scottish antecedents as political kin? THE government should be contingencyplanning for the consequences of Scottish independence, but the consequences are difficult to predict given the uncertainties around Scotland's currency, membership of the EU and the size of its oil reserves, said Dara Calleary, Fianna Fail's spokesman on enterprise and employment.|||Scotland already competes with Ireland with a similar tourism product and has a clear lead in valuable niche markets such as golf tourism, Calleary said. While they used be one of our main competitors in terms of FDI, ""they have slipped in recent times"", he added, and our competitors are more the low-cost, high-tech economies of the Far East such as Singapore.|||""So much will depend on Scotland's status within the EU,"" said Calleary. ""If they keep the pound and stay out of the eurozone, I don't think there will be any major change. If England leaves the EU after the promised referendum in 2017 and Scotland stays in, they have a huge amount to gain at that stage from that scenario.|||""But if Scotland was not an EU country and England were to leave, we would be the major winners in that situation. The kind of investment that could potentially flow into Ireland from London in particular would be quite significant, and that is something our government needs to be contingency-planning for.""|||The referendum merited a fleeting reference — alongside Britain's possible exit from the EU — in a draft national risk assessment published by the government in April. If the so-called Brexit (British exit) option was taken, ""it could introduce profound uncertainty into Anglo-Irish relations"", the report warned. Similarly, the outcome of the Scottish referendum on independence could introduce ""an element of instability"" into Northern Ireland. ""It wouldn't be lost on us if we had a near neighbour with a similar approach to attracting FDI,"" said a senior government source. ""But we are very confident of our ability in all circumstances — including Scottish independence — to continue to attract more than our share of overseas investment.""|||At the height of the Celtic tiger, Salmond and the SNP spoke of mimicking Ireland's corporation tax rate. In government on their own, however, they produced a white paper last year — Scotland's Future — promising a gradual move to no more than three points below Britain's 20% corporation tax rate ""to counter the gravitational business pull of London"".|||""That would certainly promote tax competition, but I'm not sure Scotland will implement it because it will be very unpopular in the EU, which has already put a lot of pressure on Ireland to harmonise its corporation tax,"" said Michael Keating, politics professor at the University of Aberdeen. ""If Scotland wants to get into the EU as an independent country, it is going to be quite difficult if they are trying to engage in tax competition ... If [the SNP] were to stick to that policy, however, it would pose some real problems for Ireland.""|||Keating, who will speak at a conference on the Scottish referendum at Dublin's Royal Irish Academy next week, said independence poses other challenges to Ireland, north and south, beyond the fight for foreign investment. Perhaps the least of these is the uncertainty over the British-Irish common travel area, raised when the House of Commons select committee on Scottish affairs suggested Scotland would have to join mainland Europe's borderfree Schengen agreement and leave the British-Irish free travel area.|||What we would see, said Keating, is a shift towards Euroscepticism in the rest of the UK, not because of losing Scotland's 4m votes but because the south of England would become even more important as the political centre of gravity to the remainder of the nation. ""In Scotland, people are not obsessed about the EU,"" he said. ""In England, you have anti-EU parties — Ukip and the anti-EU wing of the Conservative party — and that pushes the debate towards Euroscepticism, particularly in the south of England.""|||With Scotland out of Great Britain, Euroscepticism would be magnified as a political point of difference between the main parties. Quite apart from economic concerns, however, is the sense of impending bereavement within the unionist community in Northern Ireland with its historic and cultural connections to western Scotland, in particular. ""One shouldn't underestimate the strength of feeling that there is here and especially within the unionist community about the bonds between Northern Ireland and Scotland within the UK,"" said Jeffrey Donaldson, Democratic Unionist party MPfor Lagan Valley.|||""If Scotland were to choose independence, it would be like losing a member of the family in unionist terms.""|||Donaldson believes the Scots will stay their hand and vote against leaving the union but, if they don't, he says a fascinating chain of events may flow from their independence. ""One of the consequences of Scottish independence would be momentum behind the drive for an English parliament, and I think you would see greater devolution within England itself and to the English regions,"" he said.|||""Within a smaller UK, comprising England, Wales and Northern Ireland, over time there would be a reconfiguration of the relationships and the governance. That would potentially mean more devolution to Northern Ireland and to Wales.""|||Keating sees the concern in the unionist community as something approaching an identity crisis. Northern Ireland was ""another planet"" to most people in the south of England, but there was a historic memory in Scotland of the union with Ireland. ""First of all, what union will Irish unionists belong to after Scottish independence? Ireland, as it then was, joined Britain, as it then was, in 1800. If there is no longer a Britain, what is the union?"" he asked.|||""Unionism in Northern Ireland is allegiance to the crown, it is allegiance to the state, it is a kind of Protestant ethnic identity and if one of those comes away — one of the most powerful bits of that heritage which is common to certainly the west of Scotland and the north of Ireland — then what does unionism amount to?"" Ian McKerron of the Yes Scotland campaign group is conscious of unionist sensibilities, but said the issue hadn't featured high in the referendum debate in Scotland.|||""We will remain very close friends with people in the other islands that make up this archipelago, that is not going to change,"" he said.|||DANNY McCOY, director-general of Ibec, a business lobby group, says Ireland would survive the challenge of a newly independent neighbour. Scotland may be geographically closer than the 2004 EU ""accession"" states, but if our FDI flows did not collapse overnight when 10 new countries signed up, they were unlikely to collapse with the arrival of an independent Scotland. ""We can safely move beyond the Scottish independence question and say 'it ain't necessarily so', that it is going to be a disastrous or bad thing for us,"" he said.|||""If the remainder of the UK felt it needed to keep Northern Ireland attached, then Northern Ireland will also get a whole slew of devolved powers similar to the Scots, and a 12.5% tax rate for the north could be the most tangible manifestation of that.|||""Ibec supports a 12.5% corporation tax rate for the north on the basis that a functioning, successful Northern Ireland will be positive for the whole island; I don't think you will hear a huge sucking sound of all investment going north.""|||If Ireland can be marketed as a single unit for tourism, why not for investment purposes without the political unification, asks McCoy. If Scotland votes itself out of Britain on September 18, who knows what other tectonic plates may shift.|||IF SCOTLAND WERE TO CHOOSE INDEPENDENCE, IT WOULD BE LIKE LOSING A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN UNIONIST TERMS"
VISIONS OF APOCALYPSE,Denmark,"RIGA - Plagues, nuclear armageddon, alien invasions...when or how the apocalypse arrives is anyone’s guess. But there’s a Latvian underground biking collective named in anticipation of humanity’s doom, and perhaps they know something we don’t.|||They are the Riders of the Apocalypse, and though their name may sound rather ominous, it certainly shows they believe they have staying power, as its brand won’t exactly seem “passe” until at least the end of time.|||Upon first hearing of this “biking collective,” one may assume this means motorbikes. It could even mean Latvia’s answer to the Hell’s Angels. But how wrong this would be: they meant bicycles. And they didn’t just mean riding them — they meant making, recycling and reinventing them.|||“We’re doing everything in an extremely DIY way,” explains Karlis Rinkevic, a 20-year-old mechanic who taught himself to weld metals alongside the other Riders. “Whatever you want, we can make it.”|||And they mean it. Throughout their workshop in northern Riga, set down beside hammers, nails and rusty wheels, are a collection of bikes, made out of recycled materials ranging from curtain rails to lawnmowers, and from hospital beds to shopping trolleys, all put together by these young bike aficionados.|||Many are renovation works; old bike frames redone. But some, like the cycling shopping trolley, or their cycling teddy bear, are ‘FreikBikes’ — a series of bizarre and contorted redesigns: their frames appear stretched at mad angles, with wheels of various sizes. The results are like strange creations from the lab of Doctor Frankenstein, but essentially they work, and they are good fun to ride.|||Peddling Ladas|||One recent project has been especially symbolic. The Riders have found an old broken down Soviet-era Lada and replaced its burnt-out engine with pedal contraptions. It will not be winning the Tour de France any time soon; it takes four riders peddling with all their might to get it up to a speed of 20kph.|||But in its conception, and in its execution, it’s an idea that wonderfully sums up the new Baltic generation’s reforging of its identity in the post-Soviet age. The manufacture of the Lada was once a proud symbol of Soviet heavy manufacturing. And the repurposing of this rusty emblem, otherwise consigned to the scrapheap of history, shows the ability to appropriate symbols and use them to demonstrate a new world view.|||To bring that message home even more clearly, the peddling Lada served as a police car in soviet times, and the Riders found it still containing several books by Karl Marx.|||Ironically, the repurposed Lada is regularly trailed and stopped by active policemen, who for legal reasons insist the peddling Lada can only drive on the sidewalk, to the bafflement and amusement of tourists and passers by.|||But like so many brilliant and wacky ideas, the conscious reasoning was far more simple than the preceding paragraphs suggest. In fact, the Eureka moment came about almost as a joke: two Riders wished they could cycle home after a night out, but did not trust their abilities (at that point in the evening) to cycle home on two wheels. Thus the idea was born — a justification for nights out in Riga if there ever was one.|||Screeching alley cats|||“We’re trying to make this whole underground scene a little less underground,” says Edijs Kleijsters, a charismatic 20 year old Rider. “We’re trying to make a proper community, and we want to show that cycling is not just transportation from A to B; that if if you do this stuff, it becomes a lifestyle.”|||The challenge for the Riders of Apocalypse has been how to get this message to other young Latvians. One way they have been doing that is through organising AlleyCat Riga, a street race where you set your own route through the city, and then race to a previously chosen end point. All you need is your own bike.|||Last Saturday, undeterred by poor weather, 50 Alley Cats screeched through Riga’s Old Town, dodging traffic, veering round sharp corners and ending up at an after party that lasted until the early hours of the morning.|||The need for music at these parties is often satisfied by a music bike, where a set of speakers and laptop have been attached to amplifiers and a car battery, before being fixed up to the frame of a cargo bike and cycled to wherever the party’s happening: “It’s music on the move!” says Rinkevic, his eyes bright with the memories of good times as a cycling DJ.|||On the back of these sorts of events, Alley Cat has reached over 400 likes on Facebook, and the organisers believe it still has a long way to grow. The Riders regularly post updates and start conversations online, including a promo Youtube video for the race, artistically shot in sombre black and white.|||When asked how involved they were on social media, the Riders looked as if they had been asked the most obvious question in the world. Kleijsters replied swiftly: “We’re using a lot of social media - there’s a lot of blah-blah-blah chats. We just speak and that’s how our word spreads.”|||Another way they are reaching out is by being on hand to teach any young teenagers how to weld and fix their own bikes. “We just love to spread our knowledge. It’s always about sharing.” says Kleijsters.|||This represents a behaviour shift from when Rinkevic first started a few years ago. The cycling scene was much smaller back then, he says, and the experienced guys would always be busy, and never keen to help the younger guys learn. “Don’t watch my hands!” imitated Rinkevic, his own hands as he does so covered with the grey tint of oil. “They were angry all the time!”|||“But now” continues Rinkevic, looking more optimistic as he does so, “There are many more good guys who know how to make your bike.” He smiles, looking down at his hands.|||The chain reaction|||The emergence of Riders of the Apocalypse is no anomaly. It is part of an increasingly vibrant cycling culture throughout Latvia. A linchpin of this cycling culture is the strong bike messenger community, also known as cycle couriers.|||Though it may seem like a strange technological regression in the age of the internet, and instant communications via emails, the requirements of legal and financial companies to obtain handwritten signatures for contracts gives plenty of work for these young couriers. And the frequently bad traffic jams in Riga, combined with issues of parking and high fuel costs, make cycle couriers far more speedy, reliable and cheap when it comes to delivering packages.|||A day job as a bike messenger allows many of the Riders a chance to make their bike making financially sustainable, and they become key pillars in the cycling community. All too often the winner of AlleyCat races and other races around Riga happens to be a veteran bike messenger, well-accustomed to weaving through the streets by day, delivering business contracts to companies hungering for a speedy deal.|||The Riders of the Apocalypse are also emerging alongside a thriving micro manufacturing scene. The revival of Erenpreiss Bikes in 2012 was another symbolic moment. Once the pre-eminent Latvian bike manufacturer in the 1920s and 30s, Erenpreiss was closed down by the Soviets when the Latvian cycle manufacturing industry was nationalised after World War II.|||Its revival by Toms Erenpreiss, a descendent of the Lativan designer Gustav Erenpreiss, has brought back one of the most iconic Latvian bicycle designs to Latvia’s streets.|||Other companies are following suit, with manufacturers like Dip Dapp creating bikes for children, and companies like Woodstick making bikes that look as though they are made from wood. There are even two Latvian artists who created a bike made entirely from glass!|||Riga’s cycling scene is buoyed on by political factors too. Riga’s City Council, prodded by the European Union to reduce its carbon emissions — and eager to present Riga as a viable centre of sustainable cycle tourism, following in the tyre tracks of Scandinavian countries like Denmark — has introduced the Riga City Sustainable Energy Action Plan (2010-2020), and a major part of the plan has been the introduction of cycle lanes and bike parking areas; which, though interspersed rather randomly through the city, have made cycling much easier and much less haphazard.|||Even the consistently poorly thought-out execution of some of these council initiatives are being watched hawkishly to make sure they don’t go wrong, mostly by a well established group of pro-cycling lobbyists such as the European Cycle Logistics Federation.|||And regular publicity stunts keep bringing cycling to the attention of Riga’s public. Just this October the European cycling group Let’s Bike It even bolted brightly colored car-sized frame constructions to their bikes as a way of demonstrating how cycling can dramatically reduce rush hour traffic.|||A new Baltic Way|||Of course, it is impossible to ignore the importance of professional cycling in the region. The Baltic Chain Tour, a professional race through the Baltic States celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, and is now a regular feature on the international circuit alongside the Tour De France and the Giro d’Italia. And there is also the increasingly popular Riga-Jurmala Grand prix that takes place in Latvia each year.|||Kleijsters, when asked if he was inspired by these sorts of events, and by the 2012 London Olympic-style racing, he responded positively: “We are highly inspired by all this! We are really big fans! We watch it! We know everything about it! We talk about it in the same way that maybe other guys would talk about cars!”|||And how about all that gear, all that kit? Rinkevic responds:|||“We are highly inspired by all this Olympic kit and all this drag bike kit. But of course we can afford none of it! So we make our own versions of it!”|||A lifestyle like that of a professional cyclist, whose kit is so enormously expensive, so out of reach for the average Latvian, must be frustrating to observe for the Riders. But the spirit with which the Riders of the Apocalypse have innovated to build their own quality kit is wonderful to witness.|||They are always looking to find ways to get round the exclusivity that comes with high price tags. In their upcoming races, they are keen to make thrift a virtue rather than a weakness. Who can make the most with the least becomes the new question.|||And when asked about what plans are on the horizon in this respect, the Riders reveal another interesting plan: the idea of racing the whole way along the Baltic Way.|||It’s a route remembered for the iconic moment in August 1989, when over 2 million people from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia joined hands to form a human chain that linked up the capital cities of Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn — a protest for their independence from the Soviet Union.|||Independence came in 1991, and the Riders want to race the Baltic Way with bikes that are not allowed to cost more than 91 Euros.|||It’s another idea that’s as revolutionary as a bicycle wheel, and another clear sign of how this small Latvian biking collective epitomises the emergence of a new young generation, one that that prides itself on sustainable creativity; a generation with hope aplenty, and with strange smart new ideas for the future."
"G2: World in motion: Immigration increasingly dominates national debate in the UK. But what about elsewhere? From the far right making political capital in Scandinavia to border guards pushing migrant boats back to sea in Australia and the millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, Guardian correspondents examine the global picture",Denmark,"Few issues excite politicians' and voters' passions as much as immigration. For decades now, the world has been on the move: last year, according to the United Nations Population Fund, the number of people living outside their country of origin reached 232 million - 50% more than in 1990.|||That may feel like a lot of people; in fact, it represents just 3.2% of the world's population. They are, however, unevenly spread: 60% live in the developed world, including 72 million in Europe, 71 million in Asia and 53 million in North America. Nearly two-thirds of migrants currently living in the developed world came from a developing country.|||Logically, the developed world is also where international immigrants represent a larger proportion of the total population: 10.8%, against just 1.6% in developing regions. Migrants, for example, now make up 9.8% of the total|||population in Europe, 14.9% in North America, and more than 20% in Oceania.|||But it seems migration patterns are shifting. While more people still settle in developed countries than in developing, the growth rate is now higher in the latter: 1.8% against 1.5%. Also, overall migration is slowing. From 2000 to 2010, 4.6 million people left their home country each year; that number is now 3.6 million. But migration and its effects, real or perceived, remain one of the defining political and social issues of the day. In Britain and the US, the subject - anti-immigration; Ukip's onward march; Barack Obama's decision to give up to 5 million immigrants work permits - dominates national debate.|||But what about elsewhere in the world? Is everyone as obsessed by immigration?|||Jon Henley|||Russia:|||Despite a big immigrant population, there are no ethnic enclaves:|||Hop on a metro train in Moscow or visit a market in any of Russia's|||major cities and faces from Central Asia and the Caucasus will be everywhere. According to United Nations figures, Russia has more immigrants than any other country in the world, save the United States, with about 11 million foreigners living in the country at any one time and a large grey labour market.|||Immigrants have been responsible for the lion's share of the construction and other work that has taken place during Vladimir Putin's presidency, when, at least until recently, high oil prices fuelled a building boom.|||Much of the immigration to Russia is from countries that were once part of the Soviet Union and have suffered economic decline since its collapse. Whole villages in mountainous Tajikistan empty of their menfolk each summer as hundreds of thousands travel to Russia to work on construction sites and do other menial jobs.|||Partly because many of the immigrant communities are transient and temporary, and partly because of active government policies to prevent it, Moscow's enormous migrant population has never translated into ethnic districts. There is no Southall or Chinatown here; no part of the city to go to for Central Asian plov or Caucasian khinkali dumplings. Instead, the migrant populations are spread around the city; a small intellectual class that is more or less integrated into Russian life, and an underclass of labourers who live in makeshift housing on construction sites or in cheap hostels.|||The low living standards and the bureaucratic hurdles that make it impossible for many migrants to work without paying bribes has led to tension and mistrust among Russians. A survey over the summer for the Levada polling agency found that 76% of Russians felt the number of immigrants should be restricted, and just 12% said they had a positive opinion of migrants from the south Caucasus.|||Occasionally these latent tensions bubble over into violence, most notably last year in the Moscow suburb of Birulyovo, where riots broke out after a Russian football fan was killed by a migrant from Azerbaijan.|||Even Alexei Navalny, the great hope of Moscow's liberal classes, has disturbingly nationalist views. Navalny says he merely wants to see visas introduced for the former Soviet republics, but in his earlier years he appeared in videos comparing migrant workers to cockroaches.|||The government has tried to tread a careful line|||between exploiting and reining in nationalist sentiment, but there are few conscious efforts to improve the lot of unskilled migrants. In 2005, nationalist politician Dmitry Rogozin released a campaign video with the slogan: ""Let's clean the rubbish away from Moscow."" It was clear that migrant workers were the rubbish, pictured speaking bad Russian and leering at a blonde Russian woman. Even in Russia, the video was controversial, but what might have been career-ending for a politician in another country, only boosted Rogozin's ratings. He is now the deputy prime minister.|||Shaun Walker|||Sweden, Denmark and Norway:|||Scandinavia's liberal attitude is being tested by the far right:|||We tend to think of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, collectively, as liberal, progressive social democracies, but they have traditionally had quite different approaches to immigration. The region has more immediate and significant challenges to face - productivity stagnation and increased inequality (Denmark), a slumping oil price (Norway) and an ageing population (Sweden) - but anti-immigration parties across the region have skilfully exploited the concerns of predominantly lower-income groups to reap huge dividends in the polls. Thus immigration has been the most significant political issue in Scandinavia for more than a decade.|||Norway is one of the world's most generous donors of foreign aid, but is generally considered the least welcoming in the region towards immigrants. Actually, in 2013 Norway was second only to Sweden in the per capita number of refugees it welcomed (the largest number from Eritrea, followed by Somalia and Syria), but things have changed dramatically since the election that year, after which the rightwing Progress party - of which Anders Behring Breivik was a former member - was admitted into the ruling coalition for the first time. Its leader, Siv Jensen, a vocal Islamophobe, was appointed finance minister. Today, Norway is deporting people at a record rate: more than 7,000 this year.|||In Denmark, next year's election is expected to bring a record vote for the far right Danish People's party (it won the highest number of votes in the recent European elections). This is not the first time the party has tasted success: it was the powerbroker in the right-leaning government for the first decade of the 21st century, and forced through numerous controversial immigration laws, largely to prevent family repatriation.|||In Denmark, ""immigrant"" is often conflated with ""Muslim"", while ""freedom of speech"" is commonly interpreted as ""freedom to insult Islam and other visible minorities"". This we saw with the Muhammad cartoon crisis of 2005/6, and again just last month in the exhibition in Copenhagen of Swedish artist Dan Parks's works depicting lynchings of local black leaders, which had been banned in his homeland.|||Sweden has long accepted more immigrants than any other Scandinavian country, and continues to do so: last year it admitted roughly 20% of all EU asylum seekers. This year it is predicting a record number of refugees will apply for asylum, the majority from Syria. The Swedish ruling class has long been a curious mix of fiercely progressive social democrats and rather murky industrialists (usually the bad guys in Swedish crime fiction). The former approve the open-door policy on grounds of compassion, but both public and private sectors feast on the cheap labour: Sweden's economy has consistently outperformed Denmark's over the past decade. Meanwhile, a compliant media has sidelined anti-immigration voices, leading to accusations of self-censorship (mostly from the Danes who have grown tired of Swedish sanctimony regarding the prominence of the Danish People's party). This kept the far-right out of the political mainstream for many years, but at the last general election in September, the Sweden Democrats - which has its origins in neo-nazism - won 13% of the vote, doubling its previous tally. The party's support is predominantly among working-class voters in the south.|||One final curiosity: all the Scandinavian rightwing parties offer what is to British eyes an improbable blend of xenophobia and an almost nostalgic social democratic affection for the welfare state. Imagine if, instead of wanting to privatise the NHS, Nigel Farage pledged to increase taxes to fund its expansion . . .|||Michael Booth|||Australia:|||Shaped by waves of migrants but now turning back the boat people:|||People turning up on boats. Nothing has played a greater role in defining Australia, in shaping the country's character, in directing its development. Nothing, now, is more controversial. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said earlier this year that the arrival of the First Fleet in Australia was the defining moment in the country's history. Yet he won election on a platform of promising to ""stop the boats"" of all asylum seekers.|||Australia has a curiously contradictory attitude towards migrants: at once welcoming and hostile, depending almost exclusively on mode of arrival. Fundamentally, Australia prides itself on being multicultural. It is a nation of immigrants. One in four Australians was born overseas, and in nearly 20% of households, a language other than English is the dominant tongue. Net migration is forecast by the government to increase each year to 2017, the last year of projections. India and the UK provided nearly a third of new Australian citizens last year.|||The statistics are reflective of Australia's human history, essentially one of successive waves of migration. The arrival of Indigenous Australians, from Africa via Asia, between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago; the First Fleet convicts in 1788; postwar generations of ""populate or perish"" sponsored migrants; the dismantling of the White Australia Policy; the first ""unauthorised"" boat arrivals in the 1970s: Australia has been shaped, and irrevocably altered, by its migrants.|||But in 21st-century Australia, the vast bulk of the country's migration programme is barely discussed. Periodically, there are debates about whether the driest inhabited continent on earth can support a ""Big Australia"" of 35 million, or discussions of guest worker programmes for Pacific Islanders. But essentially Australia talks only of asylum seekers and refugees.|||Australia displays a divided attitude towards those seeking asylum. Those resettled in Australia through the government's humanitarian programme are seen as ""deserving"" refugees, welcomed and supported. Those who arrive unannounced by boat are condemned as ""illegals"" and ""queue jumpers"".|||This is despite most boat arrivals coming from Burma, Afghanistan, Iran and Sri Lanka, countries where there are no refugee queues. And it is despite the fact that there are now fewer places in the queue: at the same time as stopping the boats, Australia has cut its refugee resettlement intake by almost a third, from 20,000 to 13,750 people a year.|||The government says its self-proclaimed ""hardline"" policies against boat arrivals are based on a humanitarian rationale, designed to stop drownings at sea, to ""break the people smugglers' business model"", and to protect Australia from ""threats to its national security"". But more than 90% of those arriving by boat are found to be genuine refugees, requiring Australia's protection. And their numbers - save for a significant spike in 2012 and 2013 - have generally been fewer than 1% of Australia's total migrant intake.|||However, the policy on its most fundamental level is successful. Boats are no longer coming.|||Australia is one of only five jurisdictions in the world known to forcibly push asylum-seekers' boats back to sea. Those that reach Australia are taken out of the country, held in prison-like camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, where instances of self-harm, disease and violent physical and sexual assault are common. The average length of detention is 426 days. Australia also incarcerates asylum-seeker children without charge. Currently, more than 600 are in detention.|||Ben Doherty|||India:|||Terror and security fears have made migration a potent issue:|||It was dusk in early November when the suicide bomber struck Wagah, the only land crossing between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan, killing at least 55 people. India's orange-turbaned border guards and their black-clad Pakistani counterparts had already lowered both country's flags in a display of goose-stepping nationalism attended daily by spectators.|||Due to tight security, the bomber blew himself up a few hundred metres from the actual gate separating the two countries. But for India, it was close enough to serve as a potent reminder of how vulnerable it is to terrorist infiltration. Six years ago, Pakistani nationals carried out the Mumbai attacks in which more than 150 people were killed.|||Terror and security issues have largely driven India's immigration policy. India's 2,300km border with Pakistan is fenced and so brightly floodlit it is visible from space. But increasingly, illegal migration and population pressures too are in play.|||In the east, along India's 3,360km border with Bangladesh, shoot on sight orders allow border guards to kill with impunity. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 1,000 people, including many children, have been killed by Indian border guards since 2000. Most victims are poor, landless farmers seeking a marginally better life in India. Migration is overwhelmingly undocumented. While the World Bank's official figures suggest a net outflow, estimates for the number of illegal immigrants run from 3 million to 20 million. And migration to the country is increasingly a potent religious and political issue.|||During the election campaign earlier this year, India's new Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, told a rally that ""these Bangladeshis better be prepared with their bags packed"" when he came to power. Meanwhile, he said, India should make space for Hindu migrants left behind when the British carved up the subcontinent in 1947.|||Hindus fled to India and Muslims to East and West Pakistan, with up to a million slaughtered. East Pakistan - now Bangladesh - gained its independence in 1971 in another bloody conflict. Ever since those partitions, migration within the region has remained a thorny emotional issue.|||But even garden-variety visitors to India hardly find a red carpet welcome. Despite Modi's economic charm offensive and encouragement for businesses to ""Make in India"", the regime for both business and tourist visas remains Kafkaesque. In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rating, India has actually fallen eight places to 139 out of 189 economies surveyed in 2014.|||Perhaps the most bizarre legacy of India's failure to forge a humane, coherent immigration policy, free from the hangovers of colonialism, lies in a tiny parcel of land called Dahala Khagrabari #51. It's a Bangladeshi jute field, completely encircled by an Indian village, which is itself entirely surrounded by Bangladeshi territory. Its inhabitants and those of a staggering 161 other such ""enclaves"", created in the chaotic aftermath of independence, are stateless and confined to their islands of terrain.|||India has ignored the problem for six decades, possibly on the assumption that the problem may eventually go away. Its immigration policy suffers from the same wilful blindness. Fencing people out might solve some problems. But the twin regional factors of poverty and climate change could see millions of people, particularly from Bangladesh, seeking sanctuary in India. At that point, New Delhi may have to look beyond barbed wire and bullets.|||Anu Anand|||Pakistan The war in Afghanistan has triggered a huge influx of refugees:|||Pakistan is home to one of the largest refugee populations in the world. The majority are Afghan refugees who began arriving after the Soviet invasion in 1979 and have continued in waves through the following decades of war. The UN says there are currently about 1.6 million refugees living in Pakistan, and in total they have helped repatriate 3.8 million Afghan refugees. The government, meanwhile, says there are another million Afghan refugees who are undocumented, while some experts place the total number of Afghan refugees closer to 4 million.|||In the sixth most populous country in the world, accurate figures are hard to come by. Junaid Arshad Khan from the International Organisation of Migration says the government only publishes daily figures for border crossings between the two countries - around 40,000 to 50,000 each day - but points out that many are daily migrants.|||Yet despite the high number of refugees, there is currently little national debate about immigration, according to Haris Gazdar from the Collective for Social Science Research: ""There have been similar debates to those in the west - with migrants linked to crime, and a draw-down on resources. But at the moment that has died down and there is not a serious debate about repatriation or immigration policy in general.""|||The lack of debate is partly because many Afghan refugees live in areas where they have strong ethnic and cultural links to the local population. But Sanaa Alimia, an academic who researches Afghan refugees, says there has been a growing hostility in recent years - and this normally comes from people at government level. She says she has come across mass arrests and harassment of refugees as a way to ""encourage"" them to be repatriated. And she points out that only Afghan refugees who are registered can access services - from education and housing to healthcare - and have protection against repatriation or arrest. Although many refugees arrived decades ago, few become citizens unless they marry into the local population.|||The more than a million people who are internally displaced by military operations against militants and natural disasters are part of the debate about immigration, says Alimia. But other smaller populations of migrants from elsewhere in south Asia - or skilled workers from China - are seldom mentioned. Meanwhile more than 4 million Pakistanis are migrants to countries including India, Saudi Arabia and the UK - and remittances from abroad make up 5.7% of the country's GDP.|||Homa Khaleeli|||Spain:|||The economic crisis means more people are leaving than arriving:|||In Spain, the discussion regarding migrants arriving in the country has been overshadowed by worries about the number of people leaving. Fifteen years ago, immigrants from Ecuador, Bolivia, Romania and Morocco drove the immigrant population in the country from less than 2% in 1999 to 12% in 2009, but today many of these same migrants are leaving. In the face of an unemployment rate that hovers around 24%, many of Spain's migrants are heading home, joining the exodus of Spaniards hoping to find better job opportunities abroad.|||Spain became a net exporter of people in 2010; last year some|||550,000 people left while 250,680 migrated to the country, primarily from Morocco, Romania and the UK. The figures, from the National Statistics Institute, are not exact, only reflecting the number of people who have registered with local authorities in their municipality; many foreigners have taken their name off municipal rolls to avoid a new requirement to declare assets located abroad.|||The economic crisis has led the number of Latin American migrants to drop off considerably in recent years, says Joaquin Arango, a professor of sociology at Madrid's Complutense University. Increasingly taking their place are migrants from China, who see business opportunities in the crisis.|||Compared with many other European countries, there has been less rejection of migration in Spain, says Arango. ""Even after seven years of economic crisis, we haven't seen any kind of generalised backlash."" The explanation, he says, lies in the country's transition to democracy after more than three decades of dictatorship. ""The values associated with democracy - anti-racism, equality - became entrenched."" He points to remarks by David Cameron in 2011 urging the British public to report illegal immigrants. ""In Spain this would be unthinkable.""|||Those who work with immigrants worry that this attitude is slowing eroding, says Mikel Araguas, of Andalucia Acoge (Welcome Andalusia), a non-profit group dedicated to helping immigrants integrate. As Spain suffers harsh austerity measures, migrants are increasingly being seen as competitors for the scarce social resources, says Araguas. ""We're starting to see a discourse that seeks to criminalise immigration, with some media asking whether these groups pay taxes or whether they're scamming social services."" Food banks run by far-right groups and who serve only needy Spanish nationals have sprouted across the country, while in the Basque country, the mayor of Vitoria has railed against Algerians and Moroccans, accusing them of taking advantage of social benefits.|||In September, Araguas's group formalised its efforts to fight back, launching a project called Stop Rumours. Tackling the most commonly heard stereotypes, such as migrants being a burden on the country's healthcare system or that they are taking all the jobs, the project's website offers videos and statistics to dispel the myths. More than 300 people have signed up for the group's workshops, intended to give people the tools to counter this discourse.|||The stereotypes have rapidly gained strength in the absence of little public debate over immigration, says Araguas. Instead, he says, the conversation focuses on the borders at the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, where migrants spend months living rough in the hope of rushing the border fence that separates Morocco from Spain. ""It's an element that's very visual but a perversion of migration in the country.""|||Some 14,000 people rushed the fence last year, with 2,000 making it in; a minuscule drop in the bucket compared with Spain's 4.6 million immigrants. Still, the border fences have become the flashpoint of the debate over migrants in Spain, with human rights groups, the European Union and United Nations expressing concerns about Spain's actions, while the Spanish government pushes forward, fortifying the triple fence and covering it with anti-climbing mesh. It's a futile debate in a country that has become a net exporter of people, says Araguas.|||Ashifa Kassam|||South Africa:|||Well-educated Zimbabwean migrants are much sought after:|||South Africa is among the biggest recipients of refugees in the world. Yet the issue remains surprisingly marginal in political discourse. When President Jacob Zuma delivered his state-of-the-nation address to parliament in June, its more than 29,000 words did not mention immigration once.|||This is despite an official unemployment rate of 25.4%, alleged mistreatment of asylum seekers in detention and frequent explosions of xenophobic violence, notably in 2008 when 62 people, including 21 South Africans, were killed and more than 150,000 displaced.|||Immigration figures are notoriously imprecise. South Africa's 2011 census says 3.3% - or about 1.7 million - of the country's 51.8 million population are ""non-South African"" citizens. Data collated by the World Bank and the UN suggest a migrant population of about 1.86 million. But the number of undocumented or illegal migrants is unknown.|||A total of 108,711 applications for temporary and permanent residence were approved by the government in 2013. Two-thirds of these were from Zimbabwe, Nigeria, China, India, Pakistan, the UK, Lesotho and Angola. ""Most of these people bring skills into the country,"" statistician-general Pali Lehohla said earlier this year.|||There are also asylum seekers: media reports often describe South Africa as the world's largest recipient. But an investigation by the Africa Check website found the evidence to be ""flawed, inaccurate and sharply contradictory"", while Amnesty International has said it understands that nine out of 10 applications are rejected. Newspaper proprietor Trevor Ncube, harassed at an airport after a business trip in 2012, tweeted: ""It's time South African immigration stopped assuming every black African coming into the country is a desperate criminal.""|||Neighbouring Zimbabwe is easily the biggest source after more than a decade of political and economic turmoil under President Robert Mugabe. Estimates of the number of Zimbabweans in South Africa vary wildly from 1.5 million to 3 million. Coming from a country with the highest literacy rate in Africa, they are often sought after by employers as nannies, security guards or waiters on low pay, prompting some South Africans to accuse them of ""stealing jobs"".|||Meanwhile, Somalis, fleeing 20 years of civil war, have carved a reputation as traders. A 2012 report by the City Press newspaper quoted residents of a township near Cape Town as saying Somali traders are cheaper, friendlier, trade from 5am to 10pm and extend small amounts of credit to regular customers. This has provoked a deadly backlash from local shop owners who feel their territory under threat.|||But far from exploiting this anger for political gain, Zuma recently chided South Africans for failing to match immigrants' entrepreneurial spirit. ""Our people are waiting for government,"" he told a media gathering in Pretoria last month. ""Our people are not used to standing up and doing things. These ones [foreigners] are not expecting any government to do anything so they get here, see opportunities and exploit them.

Green-Energy Inspiration Off the Coast of Denmark,Denmark,"Correction Appended|||Before dawn one morning in October, a handful of Americans gathered at a lonely pier on Samso, a small Danish island about four hours from Copenhagen. Bundled in layers of fleece and wool, the Americans, mostly from islands off the Maine coast, had come to get a closer look at a wind farm — 10 mighty turbines spinning in the Kattegat strait — that has helped make Samso a symbol for a greener future, one powered entirely by renewable energy.|||Among them was Marian Chioffi, the bookkeeper at the electric company in Monhegan, Me., whose population of about 60 swells to include hundreds of residents and thousands of tourists in the summer. They — along with generations of artists like Edward Hopper, Rockwell Kent and Jamie Wyeth — have been drawn by the island’s lost-in-time charm and picturesque setting in the Gulf of Maine.|||Monhegan faces challenges as stark as its beauty. Foremost among them — and the spur for the journey to Denmark — is dependence on expensive, dirty fuels for heating and electricity. Even with the recent fall in oil prices, Monhegan residents pay among the highest power rates in the nation — almost six times the national average — and the electric company, locally owned and operated, struggles to keep the lights on.|||Twenty years ago, Samso faced similar problems. Its farming and fishing industries were in decline, and its electricity and heating costs, mostly from diesel and coal, were rising. Its young people were leaving the island to attend high school and choosing not to return.|||But in 1997, the island began a long-term transformation. It won a government-sponsored contest to create a model community for renewable energy and, through a combination of wind and solar (for electricity) and geothermal and plant-based energy (for heating), the island reached green energy independence in 2005. That means Samso actually generates more power from renewable sources than it consumes over all. Attached by a power cable to the mainland 11 miles away, the island sells its excess electricity to the national utility, bringing income to the hundreds of residents who own shares in the island’s wind farms, both on land and at sea.|||Samso has attracted global attention for its accomplishments. Soren Hermansen, 55, and his wife, Malene Lunden, 49, worked for years to develop the program on the island and now have created an institute, the Samso Energy Academy[http://energiakademiet.dk/en/], to spread their story and methods to international visitors.|||The Maine islanders, along with students from the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, had traveled to Samso to attend the academy and hear the Danes’ advice. If all went well, each islander would go home with a team of students dedicated to solving an energy problem using ideas borrowed from Samso.|||Beyond that, the planners hoped, new Maine island projects could become templates for broader adoption of renewable energy. Because of their particular geography, islands often lack the resources and infrastructures to meet their own needs. Fuel, like other necessities, is often imported — sometimes with great difficulty — and electric grids, when they even exist, are often underdeveloped or out of date, all of which leads to higher prices and less reliable service. With residents open to cheaper and better alternatives, islands are becoming seedbeds of innovation, living labs in which to test and refine technologies and approaches that are too new or expensive to establish on a mainland. And their small size makes the systems easier to manage and analyze.|||Denmark is also studying the use of renewables on Bornholm, an even more remote island than Samso, in the Baltic Sea, said Rasmus Helveg Petersen, the country’s minister of climate, energy and building. The Carbon War Room, the nonprofit organization started by the Virgin Group mogul Richard Branson, and NRG Energy, an independent power producer, are experimenting with solar, wind and geothermal sources to replace diesel in the Caribbean. And the Alaska Energy Authority has awarded several renewable energy innovation grants to offshore communities.|||Suzanne MacDonald, the community energy director at the Island Institute in Rockland, which is helping oversee the Mainers’ Denmark program, argues that such projects can be useful test cases. But, she added, they work only in places where people want to use the technologies and can organize and lead the effort.|||“We can’t just put steel in the ground and technology on the grid,” she said, “unless people are a part of the process.”|||For Ms. Chioffi, seeing how the people of Samso had come to accept new technologies had particular significance. In 2009, the State of Maine designated a patch of ocean off Monhegan’s coast that is part of the state’s lobstering grounds as a test site to study renewable energy development, and plans were finally moving ahead for a long-term, public-private demonstration project that would place two turbines there. There are not yet any full-scale offshore wind farms in the United States — projects like Cape Wind near Nantucket have been delayed by legal and financial challenges — so the Mainers were eager for a rare chance to see one up close.|||It was still dark as the group boarded the Ocean Cat, a former whale-watching boat, outfitted with a kitchen, black leather seating and a large television screen. Willy Mortensen, the captain, started making coffee and chatting with the visitors. He and his mate are on call to ferry repairmen to the wind farm, which starts about 2.2 miles from Samso’s coast. That’s what they were doing on that damp morning, with the Mainers tagging along.|||The repair crew often works for 12 hours on a visit, so the captain passes the time watching episodes of “Deadliest Catch.” Mr. Mortensen said: “There’s a lot of trouble with the turbines. You’re repairing and repairing and repairing. By the time you get one fixed, the next one doesn’t work.”|||Indeed, when Mr. Mortensen nudged the bow of the boat through the heaving waters to settle near turbine No. 6, another stood idle, victim of a cracked bearing that would require a special crane boat to fix. As the workmen put on harnesses and climbed off the bucking deck to a small platform encircling the steel tower, Ms. Chioffi craned her neck to look at the machine looming overhead, its long white blades temporarily stilled in the cold, gray morning air.|||“Does seeing these give you more of a sense of the reality?” asked Sam Saltonstall, a retired Maine schoolteacher who now lives on Peaks Island, near Portland.|||“Yeah,” she said softly, stunned by how big they were. “But the ones they’re talking about putting up are twice as high as that.”|||Coffee Diplomacy|||One sunny afternoon during their weekslong stay on Samso, the five Maine islanders and about 15 students rode on bikes with Mr. Hermansen to an open field. Huge, plastic-encased bales of hay sat alongside a large plot of a dense, tufted plant called elephant grass. On the island, many private houses and public buildings connect to central heating plants established as part of the energy project. The heating plants burn hay to heat water, which then circulates through underground pipes to radiators and heat exchangers for warmth and hot water. But the plant near the academy is experimenting with elephant grass as a new source of biomass, Mr. Hermansen told the group, because it grows faster and has a higher energy content than hay.|||“We are still looking for the elephants,” Mr. Hermansen joked of the dense field.|||Part of the appeal of using the biomass is that even with low oil prices it is cheap — about one-eighth the cost of oil, which is heavily taxed in Denmark, he said. But as with some of the other renewable technologies in use on Samso, the system is not so easily replicated elsewhere. The island has open, fertile land and ground soft enough to bury the hot-water pipes. Maine’s flinty landscapes are not so accommodating. Mr. Hermansen and Ms. Lunden acknowledge as much, but argue that specific natural resources and technologies are irrelevant to developing a green community without an appeal to people’s direct and practical self-interest.|||“I’m not on a mission of saving the polar bears in the Arctic or changing the climate — I am on a mission of saying it is not good for us to be depending on imported fossil fuels,” Mr. Hermansen said. “It’s better to be in control and produce your own energy, and you can do that with green technology. So it’s actually more of a practical thing, like a farmer getting a new combine harvester.”|||Mr. Hermansen and his wife were the project’s catalyzing figures. Mr. Hermansen, who helped prepare the island’s winning proposal, grew up on a farm on Samso, but left at age 15 to attend high school on the mainland. He spent 10 years away, working on fishing boats in Norway, farming in New Zealand and teaching in a democracy-building project in Lithuania. He moved back to the island and took over his father’s farm for a time, meeting Ms. Lunden, a photographer with a background in group dynamics and leadership training, there in 1984.|||When the energy project came along, Mr. Hermansen was the obvious candidate to run it. “He can talk to everybody,” said Charlotte Villadsen, who runs a campground near the energy academy. “He’s very good at analyzing, ‘How should I present it to this group, and how should I present it to that group.’ ” Plumbers were worried about losing business if people got rid of their oil burners; Mr. Hermansen took them out for beers, Ms. Villadsen said and explained that if they learned how to install and service the new heat pumps they could move into that business. Much of the 44-square-mile island is devoted to agriculture, and to the farmers he pointed out that selling hay to the collective heating plants would provide a new income stream. Now one-quarter of Samso’s hay goes to heating.|||While the islanders — there are 3,800 of them — had a strong tradition of collaboration developed over centuries of collective farming practices, it was nonetheless tough to get everyone behind all the new green projects. One breakthrough was a government energy-efficiency program that served as an entry to selling the whole enterprise, Mr. Hermansen said. The program gave grants for updating old houses; the couple approached the older residents who often owned the eligible properties, meeting over coffee and cookies in their homes to help them figure out how to qualify for the money.|||“I drank so much coffee I was practically galvanized inside,” Mr. Hermansen said, laughing. But, once on board, those residents served as ambassadors for the larger self-sustaining green energy plan, spreading the word to their children and grandchildren.|||Now, it seems, people from all across the island are participating. Many residents who live too far from the biomass heating plants have their own sustainable sources of warmth, including in-ground heat pumps and heavily insulated wood stoves that look almost like pizza ovens. At the municipal government headquarters, a large solar array on a canopy over the parking lot feeds the building as well as charging stations for a fleet of city-owned electric Citroëns. Countryside rooftops sparkle with solar panels, for which residents receive incentives; some have smart appliances that allow them to time washing clothes and dishes to the hours of cheapest power to cut their bills further.|||Even the golf club is part of the program: Members carry hand weeders on the links and pry up errant plants, reducing the need for herbicides, and sheep graze to keep tall grasses in check. Since the members can also arrange to buy the meat, said Jesper Roug Kristensen, a golf club member who works at the energy academy, “you can eat the golf course.”|||It has taken $80 million in investment, about 20 percent from government subsidies, to turn the island into a renewable-energy community, Mr. Hermansen estimates. But in the end, the island’s accomplishments seem to stem not so much from government policies and subsidies as from Mr. Hermansen’s ability to show people how the changes could benefit them. The wind turbines, for instance, faced opposition from residents who said the modern machines would ruin the charm of their villages. So the planners moved some turbines from the most sensitive areas, but also added to their appeal by allowing locals to buy shares in the projects.|||Ole Kaempe, a teacher who can see the turbine he and his wife invested in from between the rows of wine grapes near his farmhouse, said that the income made the low mechanical hum sound better. “Otherwise it would be noise,” he said, “but now, it’s beautiful music.”|||An Imperfect Model|||Samso’s energy independence suggests that Denmark’s aggressive goal of becoming fossil-fuel free by 2050 is feasible, said Mr. Petersen, the energy minister. “We need front-runners,” he said, “and they are just that.” The country as a whole is well on its way: Last year, Denmark drew almost 40 percent of its electricity from wind, up from 33 percent the year before. Over 60 percent of Danish houses get their heat from central sources, like Samso’s, that are already using renewables or can be easily converted, Mr. Petersen said. The hardest challenge, he said, is ridding its transport system of fossil fuels, so he is looking to Samso for ideas. “I hope that they can crack that nut first.”|||To that end, the island is promoting the use of electric vehicles and plans to test using gas from decomposing waste as fuel for a new ferry set to arrive next month. Yet while the national government is expecting useful results from Samso’s efforts, there are signs that its consensus and momentum could flag. Mr. Hermansen, who says he is on the road about 100 days a year promoting the island’s story, is beginning to talk of doing other things. The academy is working with islands in Europe and Japan that are adapting Samso’s approaches, and he mused that he might shift more of his time to creating partnerships like those.|||And although many residents express pride in the island’s green image, others point to shortcomings. It still relies on fossil fuels when the wind does not blow or the heating plants break down. Only 10 to 15 percent of the population has invested in the wind farm production, and electricity bills have stayed high, in part because of Danish tax and energy policies.|||Building support for the projects based on financial self-interest can have a downside when the economics shift. At an evening reception at the end of the Mainers’ program, Jorgen Tranberg, a farmer who is chairman of the consortium that manages the offshore turbines, said that his investments had fizzled because of falling prices for wind power and lower-than-expected output.|||Samso’s wind farms produce about 105,000 megawatt-hours of electricity each year, of which roughly 80,000 are exported. Although the island earned a set rate for the first 10 years of production, it now gets a market rate that is lower in part because developers in Denmark and throughout the region have built so many wind turbines, cutting Samso’s revenue from approximately $6.4 million a year to about $3.8 million.|||That may be good for Denmark, but not so good for Samso’s investors.|||“In 10 years I don’t think there will be wind turbines on Samso,” Mr. Tranberg said. The aging equipment will need replacement one day, and new models are becoming ever larger as the wind industry seeks to lower costs by maximizing power production. It was so difficult to overcome concerns about noise and intruding on a bucolic landscape with the smaller turbines, Mr. Tranberg said, that he did not believe Samsingers would approve the bigger ones.|||As the guests celebrated over hors d’oeuvres and wine, Mr. Tranberg added that he had been spending too much of his time on turbine repairs and renegotiating an unsatisfactory service arrangement. “The last three months it’s three emails a week with bad things about the turbines,” he said. Comparing that experience with the more cheerful message the Mainers were learning at the academy, he added: “That’s another world than Soren and Malene here.”|||Bringing Samso Home|||Before the event that last night at the academy, Mr. Hermansen handed large sheets of paper for the Maine islanders and students to list their lingering questions and concerns. The Americans were skeptical that they could replicate the Samso experience back home, where clean-energy policies and subsidies are neither as consistent nor as strong as in Denmark. “How do we transfer success under the Danish regulatory structure to projects in the U.S.?” read one. Another wondered, “How to translate-encourage Danish energy conservation pragmatism/culture to American ‘comfort’ culture.”|||In the months since, the islanders and their student partners have started to answer those questions in different ways, still convinced that conservation and renewables are better energy solutions than fossil fuels, despite the falling price of oil.|||On Peaks Island, which has more than 900 year-round residents, Mr. Saltonstall is working on a plan to decrease dependence on heating oil and propane and increase energy efficiency in residences and at the elementary school, which spent roughly $800 per student on fuel last year.|||On Vinalhaven, a Maine island with a year-round population of almost 1,200, Patrick Trainor, a retired math teacher, and his partners are designing a solar field to complement an existing small land-based wind farm. The three turbines are a source of great pride to many island residents — though they are also the subject of a lawsuit — and Mr. Trainor is talking of forming an energy academy there.|||On tiny Monhegan, the year-round residents are focused on Maine Aqua Ventus, a wind project with public and private financing that may arrive near their shores whether they want it or not. Conceived as a demonstration of the potential for offshore wind, it would put two enormous turbines — 300-foot towers atop 30-foot platforms, as opposed to the roughly 200-foot machines near Samso — in a pristine section of the Atlantic Ocean. Some residents say they like the idea of potential benefits of the farm, including better broadband service and access to central Maine’s grid, which would relieve them of the burden of running and maintaining their own system. But they also worry that it could harm tourism and lobstering, as well as birds and marine life.|||Ms. Chioffi’s project is intended to help Monhegan work through those questions by borrowing engagement strategies from Mr. Hermansen and Ms. Lunden. So far, the approach is having some effect. When the Danish couple visited Monhegan in October, most island residents showed up for a discussion, and were still talking about it along the dirt roads the next day.|||For Ms. Chioffi, that alone is a kind of success and, she hopes, the beginning of a process that could finally help her island inch closer to something like Samso. Seeing the offshore farm in Denmark allayed some worries — a bird adjusted its flight path that morning to avoid the spinning blades — but made clear just how big the turbines would be. But even if Monhegan is not the best place for the Aqua Ventus wind farm, she said, it has already had one benefit: “The thing that it did for Monhegan was it got people talking about renewable energy again.”|||Correction: January 25, 2015, Sunday|||This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about how the Danish island Samso achieved renewable energy independence misstated the amount of electricity produced and exported by Samso’s wind farms. They produce 105,000 megawatt-hours, not 105, and export 80,000 megawatt-hours, not 80."
Faroe Islands Takes Nordic Cuisine to the Limits,Denmark,"I remember the potato. It had looked so ordinary, its bland familiarity a comforting contrast to the spread of unusual delicacies that greeted me upon my arrival in the Faroe Islands, the remote archipelago between Norway and Iceland. While most of the tourists come for the natural beauty—the windswept vistas, craggy gorges and adorably chubby seabirds—I’d traveled all the way from Tokyo to learn about Faroese cuisine and how it’s transforming into a new style of refined cooking.|||Three hours after leaving Copenhagen, I found myself on the edge of a cliff overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic, sitting at a table in a small, wooden hut covered with a turf roof. The hut, used for curing meat and fish, belonged to the restaurant Koks, the area’s top fine-dining establishment, located inside the sleek Hotel Føroyar in the capital city of Tórshavn. A whole leg of skerpikjøt—air-dried and fermented lamb—hung from a rod beside the door, along with aged cheese, pilot whale meat and loaf of garnatálg, a rolled sausage made from sheep’s fat and innards.|||The Koks team had wanted to show me the roots of the islands’ food culture. After explaining the region’s specialties, Johannes Jensen, managing director of the Hotel Føroyar, offered me a platter of waxy new potatoes and instructed me to place one atop a canapé of fermented pilot whale and a square of salt-cured whale blubber the size of a pat of butter. “First the whale meat, then the blubber and last the potato,” he said, layering the ingredients on his plate. The whale meat was the color of onyx, arranged in thin slices that resembled black truffles. The translucent pieces of blubber looked like miniature daikon-radish cakes and gave off a faintly floral aroma. The potato was a potato.|||“Now, into the mouth,” he said with a chuckle, chewing merrily.|||“Into the mouth,” I echoed. Living in Japan, I’d encountered whale before in many guises—raw as sashimi (reminiscent of venison), cured as “bacon” (gamy as well as fishy), simmered in dashi broth (persistently metallic) and marinated in soy sauce and sake before being deep-fried (ironically, my least favorite iteration). But I’d never had it prepared in the traditional Faroese way, hung to dry and ferment in the salty sea air until it’s reached the consistency of soft jerky. This technique of preserving fish and meat is unique to the islands (before the 1800s, the Faroes didn’t produce or import much salt), a result of the region’s geographic and climatic conditions as well as the scarcity that has historically defined life on the islands.|||Within seconds my palate was flooded with a cacophony of intense flavors. High-toned treble notes of herbaceous and floral flavors were followed by deeply funky, musky earthiness. The texture was thick and oily, and the potato had prolonged the act of chewing it. The experience remains firmly fixed in my memory.|||“It’s an acquired taste,” Jensen shrugged, before adding with a note of concern, “I hope we haven’t shocked you.”|||Shocked, no. Confounded, yes. But to say that pilot whale was the most unusual thing that I ate during my time on the Faroes would be false. Almost all of the food was unlike anything I’d ever tasted before. There were turnips so sweet that they reminded me of Asian pears; horse mussels the size of my palm, with orange flesh the texture of custard; and langoustine with crystalline meat that tasted of the sea. Faroese fermented foods offered an entirely different spectrum of visceral flavors: dried lamb laced with the tang of blue cheese, and the indescribable pungency of cured whale meat and blubber. Faroese food culture is a culinary distillation of nature’s extremes, a reflection of the contradictions inherent in the environment. On the Faroe Islands, the psychedelic green landscape is veined with streams and waterfalls but nearly devoid of trees. Although the stormy weather regularly turns planes back to Bergen or Copenhagen, the sky can suddenly explode with sunlight, shooting rainbows in every direction.|||My fascination with the Faroe Islands began two years ago, when my friend Adrien Norwood, an American chef based in Denmark, mentioned that he was going there to do a pop-up cooking event with the avant-garde Scandinavian chefs’ collective NaCL. Thanks in large part to René Redzepi and his restaurant Noma, Nordic cuisine has become a global phenomenon, attracting an unprecedented number of food tourists to Copenhagen and launching offshoots abroad. Noma has even set up shop in Tokyo, albeit temporarily, for a residency at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel from January 9 to February 14. In recent years, New Nordic enthusiasts have started exploring the culinary terrain beyond the Danish capital.|||Even so, I’d remarked, the Faroe Islands, with its scant population of 50,000 people, seemed like an unlikely destination for gourmets.|||“The products are amazing,” Norwood replied, describing the giant cod and succulent langoustines. Almost more intriguing, though, were the idiosyncratic dried and fermented foods, which have been made the same way since the 600s. I couldn’t imagine what they tasted like.|||“It’s a full-on experience,” he told me. “I don’t think you can duplicate a lot of the things on the Faroe Islands outside of the Faroe Islands. You don’t have the same wind blowing, the same saltwater going through the streams under those little wooden shacks.”|||Faroese preserved foods were born of necessity. Winters on the islands are long and frigid, and even during the temperate summer months, very little grows. According to University of the Faroe Islands professor Jóan Pauli Joensen, who has written a book on the local food culture, prior to the arrival of tubers and root vegetables, edible plants cultivated on the Faroe Islands had been limited to a handful of species, mainly barley and the herb angelica, which was the primary source of vitamin C for early settlers. Sheep, fowl and seafood were the archipelago’s most abundant resources. But without a ready supply of timber, cooking with fire was considered something of a luxury.|||“Basically, you had drying and fermenting. That’s it,” Joensen said, reminding me that salt was scarce on the islands. The Faroese made “black salt” from dried seaweed, but it wasn’t suitable for preserving food.|||In light of these challenges, the idea of creating haute cuisine based on Faroese products sounds like a quixotic endeavor, but Leif Sørensen, the region’s most famous culinary personality and former head chef at Koks, has made it his life’s mission for nearly a decade. When I met him in Copenhagen, he was en route back to the Faroes from Greenland, where he’d been researching how to develop the food culture there.|||Over a couple of beers, he described the uphill battle he had faced on the Faroe Islands. The restaurant scene had been nonexistent until 1992, when the prohibition of alcoholic beverages was repealed, and had consisted mainly of steakhouses using imported ingredients. At his first restaurant, he ran into trouble sourcing fresh local fish because the industry was focused on exports. Procuring meat was equally difficult due to government restrictions. On top of it all, the Faroese guests “didn’t want to come to eat Faroese dishes” because they saw it as “food for poor people.”|||But Sørensen is an optimist, although a pragmatic one. While he appears somber at first, he has an easy laugh and a deadpan sense of humor. When talking about the history of food on the islands, a lot of Faroese use two phrases to describe the alternating states of scarcity and plenty that have defined the culinary culture: “It was terrible” and “It was a feast.” Those familiar expressions came up as Sørensen recounted funny anecdotes about the monotonous diet he endured as a child: fish, served fresh and then fermented, and then dried, in an endless rotation. Or dried whale meat “so tough it was like leather.”|||When he helped launch Koks in 2011, he tried to “tell the story of Faroese food in a contemporary way” by incorporating traditional ingredients as accents to the dishes. At the same time, he embarked on a project to classify the edible plants that grow wild on the islands and started cooking with seaweed, which, although plentiful, had not been eaten by the Faroese. In a sense, Sørensen has been doing more than telling the story of Faroese cuisine. He’s been rewriting it—and turning a tale of paucity into one of surprising bounty.|||Sørensen’s work has paved the way for a new wave of chefs on the islands, including his young protégé, Poul Andrias Ziska, who has helmed the kitchen at Koks since February. When I dined there in late August, the food Ziska served moved through the culinary history of the islands, artfully presenting the region’s staple ingredients. Cubes of beetroot were topped with angelica, while dots of salted fish were piped onto circles of mashed potato. The flavors I’d experienced at the start of my trip made an elegant return: The depth of skerpikjøt was rendered as translucent, feather-light crisps, and a thin layer of garnatálg was roasted over potatoes in a smoky cheese sauce (fermented whale hadn’t made it onto the menu, to my relief).|||At the end of summer, the focus was on seafood: crab, veiled in thinly sliced turnips and drizzled with a concentrated crab oil, and langoustine, lightly smoked in hay and quickly pan-fried so that it was still rare in the center. A dish of sweet scallops and cauliflower had been dusted with a fine powder of sea tangle seaweed that gave off a flavor and aroma reminiscent of truffles.|||Before leaving the restaurant, I took one last look at the city of Tórshavn below. With its gently twinkling lights and quiet harbor, the view was so different from the chaotic, neon cityscape I was accustomed to in Tokyo. In the distance lay an island shaped like a whale, and beyond that, the rest of the world. I couldn’t help feeling that I’d landed at the edge of the earth, a place of improbable possibilities. “I’m sure you would like whale meat if you tasted my recipe,” Sørensen later joked. Maybe."
Greens' leader would make a good Arctic ambassador,Denmark,"Diplomats who fall foul of Foreign Office mandarins have long risked being put out in the cold or sent to remote embassies. Soon they may face both - for a House of Lords committee has recommended that Britain should have an ambassador to the Arctic.|||Britain is the Arctic's ""nearest neighbour"" because the barren Out Stack outcrop, at Shetland's northern tip, is less than 370 miles from the Arctic Circle. So it does seem odd that - unlike France, Japan, Poland and Singapore - we don't have a representative to the frozen north.|||The peers are not suggesting that we join countries like Russia, the US, Canada and Denmark in the rush for its resources. Instead, though much of the world's remaining oil and gas resources lie in the region, they advocate using the period of low prices that would make exploitation uneconomic as a chance to consider if it is wise in such a fragile area.|||Indeed much of their concern is environmental, with fast-melting ice opening opportunities for overfishing and tourism. Perhaps, if the Greens have any influence after the election, they might want the job for their tongue-tied leader, Natalie Bennett, who froze up on the radio."
"US Navy Deploys Drones Under Arctic Ice, Competes With Russia for Waterways",Denmark,"The US Navy has started to deploy underwater drones beneath the arctic ice both to study the deterioration of the ice sheet due to climate change and to help plan for anticipated increases in traffic as previously frozen waterways open up.[http://sputniknews.com/images/]|||In terms of environmental monitoring, the drones will measure salinity and temperature, for instance, which will help scientists create more accurate models to predict future rates of melting.|||But the plans are also meant to address the ""security implications"" of the opening up of the Arctic waters, according to the Navy's Arctic Roadmap, updated in 2014 to adapt to changing Arctic conditions. Part of that plan, which spans 2014-2030, is to increase the number of ships in the region, Martin Jeffries, science advisor to the Office of Naval Research, or ONR, told Military​.com.|||""Due to the significant retreat of sea ice, previously unreachable areas have started to open for maritime use several weeks each year. The predicted rise in oil and gas development, fishing, tourism, and mineral mining could alter the Regions strategic importance as Arctic and non-Arctic nations make investments,"" the Roadmap says.|||The two aspects of the are connected, as the rate of melting will determine how many more ships are deployed in the region and how quickly. The drones will focus specifically on what is known as the marginalized zone - where the solid ice shelf meets the ocean - the frontier of the Arctic ice.|||What weve been seeing in recent years is a much greater retreat of the sea ice cover in the summer time such that in the last eight years, weve seen the eight lowest minimum ice extent values in the arctic in the satellite record going back to 1979, said Jeffries.|||- J.

Doing this with high navigation accuracy makes the scientific value of the data much greater, said Jeffries. By the end of the summer in 2014, the science team had deployed over 100 robotic platforms in the ice and the ocean.|||- IDST (@idst36) March 4, 2015|||But the US Defense Department is hoping for much more advanced drone technology in the future and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA recently announced an open call to developers for unmanned vehicles with sensors to monitor the area and alert authorities to potential problems in the region.|||DARPA has up to $4 million dollars ready for those who might produce unmanned vehicles that meet its needs. The agency wants ""environmentally friendly"" vehicles that both fly and swim and which can go up to 30 days without recharging since access to the electrical grid is restricted in the Arctic.|||Competition Heats Up as Ice Melts|||The push into the Arctic is also a reaction against Russian moves to secure their interests in the Arctic and the Russian Navy's similar plans to increase their own presence in the region. Not only will the thawing ice shelf open up shorter, lucrative shipping routes, but also oil and gas reserves of great, though not precisely known, value.|||Russias revised military doctrine, signed by President Vladimir Putin in December 2014, for the first time ever named the protection of national interests in the Arctic among the main priorities for its armed forces in times of peace. Part of that has been to resume a permanent military presence and Russia has reopened a military base on the Novosibirsk Islands.|||Though the extent of the natural resources in the Arctic is currently unclear, oil and gas explorers are hoping the new thawing frontier will be a boon to their industries. Estimates are that the Arctic could hold as much as 13% of the world's undiscovered but recoverable oil, with that figure rising to 30% for gas.|||There have already been disputes about how far a country's influence extends among the five Arctic nations - Canada, Norway, Russia, Denmark through Greenland, and the United States through Alaska. Under international law those countries' Exclusive Economic Zones are limited to 200 nautical miles off their shores.|||Russia has claimed the ocean floor as an extension of the Siberian continental shelf all the way to the North Pole, where an underwater expedition symbolically dropped a Russian flag on the sea bed in 2007."

LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 05, 2015-- |||Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. (NYSE:BBW) today reported results for the 2015 first quarter ended April 4, 2015.|||First Quarter 2015 Highlights (13 weeks ended April 4, 2015 compared to the 13 weeks ended March 29, 2014): |||   -- Consolidated net retail sales were $91.7 million, compared to $96.8       million in the 2014 first quarter reflecting the negative impact of the       one-week calendar shift due to fiscal year 2014 having a 53rd week. In       addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted       net retail sales by $1.9 million primarily due to the strengthening of       the US dollar;     -- Consolidated comparable store sales increased 2%, which included a flat       performance in North America and a 13% increase in Europe. First quarter       fiscal 2015 comparable store sales are compared to the thirteen-week       period ended April 5, 2014;     -- Retail gross margin improved to 46.8% from 43.5% in the 2014 first       quarter;     -- Pretax income improved to $7.1 million compared to $5.3 million in the       2014 first quarter.

(See Reconciliation of Net Income to       Adjusted Net Income.) |||Sharon John, Build-A-Bear Workshop's Chief Executive Officer commented, ""Our year is off to a solid start highlighted by positive consolidated comparable store sales growth, expansion in retail gross margin and a 38% increase in first quarter diluted earnings per share. This quarter represents our ninth consecutive period of improved operating performance demonstrating ongoing momentum due to the successful execution of our stated strategies.|||""Our priority is to continue to focus on evolving to a position of sustained profitable growth and in the quarter, we made progress on several of our 2015 objectives including reaching an expanded consumer base more profitably with the introduction of successful proprietary and licensed product stories,"" Ms. John continued. ""We believe we are well positioned to continue our progress toward our stated goals through the balance of the year.""|||Additional First Quarter Operating Highlights (13 weeks ended April 4, 2015 compared to the 13 weeks ended March 29, 2014): |||   -- Total revenues were $93.4 million compared to $97.9 million in the 2014       first quarter reflecting the negative impact of the one-week calendar       shift due to fiscal year 2014 having a 53rd week;     -- Consolidated e-commerce sales rose 9% excluding the impact of foreign       exchange; and     -- Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $37.2 million, or       39.9% of total revenues, including foreign currency losses of $1.5       million from the re-measurement of the Company's balance sheet and       $250,000 in management transition costs. This compares to $37.8 million       or 38.6% of total revenues in the 2014 first quarter including $250,000       in management transition costs and $200,000 in foreign currency gains. |||Store Activity|||During the quarter, the Company closed eight stores and opened one location to end the period with 317 company-owned stores, including 257 in North America and 60 in Europe. The Company's international franchisees ended the 2015 first quarter with 69 stores in 13 countries.|||Balance Sheet|||The Company ended the 2015 first quarter with cash and cash equivalents totaling $54.7 million and no borrowings under its revolving credit facility. In the quarter, the Company invested $3.0 million to repurchase 154,000 shares of its common stock. Total inventory at quarter end was $51.2 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Inventory per square foot increased 16% compared to the prior year period due, in part, to early receipts of second quarter product launches.|||In fiscal 2015, the Company continues to expect capital expenditures to be between $20 million to $25 million to support the refresh and repositioning of stores as well as investment in infrastructure. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $16 million to $18 million.|||2015 Key Strategic Objectives:|||To increase shareholder value, the Company expects to continue to execute its ""MORE x 4"" strategic plan which includes continuous improvement and strategic expansion initiatives in four key areas:|||Expanding into More Places|||The Company intends to continuously improve its real estate model by strategically evolving its store portfolio to align with market trends while selectively opening new locations and systematically refreshing its store base. To this end, the Company plans to open additional stores in high potential destinations such as tourist locations, outlet malls and shop-in-shops, which have proven more productive than traditional mall stores. In the first quarter, the Company solidified plans to open four stores in outlet centers with the first location expected to open in July in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.|||The Company expects to strategically expand its international presence by leveraging the improving strength in its company-owned stores to restructure and extend its international footprint. In 2015, the Company plans to enter new markets with both a redesigned franchise model and organic corporate expansion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company successfully converted a previously franchised store to an owned location in Tivoli Gardens a popular tourist destination in Copenhagen, Denmark.|||Targeting More People|||The Company intends to continuously grow its business with its core three to twelve year-old consumer segment which represents a majority of current revenue. The Company will focus on initiatives that drive trial and increase repeat visits with an evolved segmentation, product development and marketing strategy. For example, during the important Valentine's Day period, the Company saw positive results across all consumer segments, including the core, with its ""Share your Heart"" integrated product and marketing campaign.|||The Company expects to strategically grow sales to consumers over twelve years-old with a focus on key categories including gift-giving, affinity and collectibles. This consumer segment currently represents over 20% of sales and has a tendency to over-index on less price-sensitive ""gift-able"" and on-line purchases. Therefore, the Company intends to leverage its e-commerce business to efficiently target these consumers. During the first quarter, the Company pre-launched online and subsequently in stores its Cinderella bear, the first in a series of limited edition collectible Disney princess bears. The Company successfully attracted the over twelve year-old affinity consumer as well as its core younger girls segment while establishing a new price-point threshold for the complete Cinderella product package.|||Developing More Products|||The Company intends to continuously improve and extend its efforts to develop high impact product stories coupled with integrated marketing programs that tend to garner higher price points, drive add-on purchases and create ""play beyond the plush"". Shortly after Easter, the Company successfully introduced a proprietary Promise Pets collection with strong initial consumer response from the targeted segments of older girls and boys. Promise Pets is supported with a free mobile app that allows the child to virtually bring their furry friend to ""life"", further building on the Company's goal of extending brand interaction and creating ""play beyond the plush"".|||The Company also plans to strategically expand its presence and create new revenue and profit streams by launching an out-bound licensing program to leverage its strong brand equity. Out-bound licensing will enable the Company to extend its brand reach with new offerings in relevant categories and will provide consumers with ""products beyond the plush"". During the first quarter, the Company signed agreements to sell Build-A-Bear branded products in key areas including fashions, confections, snack food and non-competitive toy categories. The Company expects to begin to realize limited revenue from royalties associated with the licensing agreements in the second half of the 2015 fiscal year with greater impact expected in the following year.|||Driving More Profitability|||The Company intends to continuously improve its value engineering initiatives to further optimize product margins while implementing new systems that should facilitate sales growth, increase efficiency and improve long term profitability. Through these efforts, the Company delivered pre-tax income of $7.1 million, an increase of $1.7 million over the prior year period, driven by a 330 basis point improvement in retail gross margin.|||The Company expects to strategically expand its profitability by prioritizing incremental growth initiatives, like those discussed above, that leverage existing infrastructure, are primarily royalty-based, and/or allow for discrete pricing and are therefore comparatively margin-accretive.|||Today's Conference Call Webcast|||5 May 2015 07:00 ET Press Release: Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc. -2-|||Build-A-Bear Workshop will host a live Internet webcast of its quarterly investor conference call at 9 a.m. ET today.

In particular, the Company provides historic earnings and earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude certain costs and accounting adjustments, which are non-GAAP financial measures. These results are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in the Company's business and provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results. These measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. |||          BUILD-A-BEAR WORKSHOP, INC.

He is calculating how many pumps he needs to buy to keep the city's streets from being flooded from a rising sea caused by climate change.|||Under a broiling sun, he takes a visitor a few blocks from his office, to where contractors are pouring concrete to replace a section of a city street. The new roadway is being laid incongruously 2-1/2 feet above the sidewalk cafe tables and storefront entrances at the old street level. The extra height is in preparation for the seas and tides that Mr. Carpenter already sees engulfing this section of Miami Beach.|||""The facts are the facts, and we have to deal with them,"" he says.|||In city after city in South Florida, local officials are dealing with climate change. So, too, are municipalities big and small across the United States. The same determination is evident among governors and legislators in more than two dozen states. And it is magnified worldwide: Surprising progress in grappling with global warming is coming from surprising nations.|||This groundswell of action on climate change is producing solutions and often bypassing lagging political leadership. The gathering force of these acts, significant and subtle, is transforming what once seemed a hopeless situation into one in which success can at least be imagined. The initiatives are not enough to halt the world's plunge toward more global warming - yet. But they do point toward a turning point in greenhouse gas emissions, and ambitious - if still uneven - efforts to adapt to the changes already in motion.|||""The troops on the ground, the local officials and stakeholders, are acting, even in the face of a total lack of support on the top level,"" says Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pa. ""The impacts of climate change are pretty bad and projected to get much worse if we continue business as usual. But there still is time to avert what we might reasonably describe as a true catastrophe. There are some signs we are starting to turn the corner.""|||Philip Levine, the mayor of Miami Beach, agrees. ""We may not have all the answers,"" he says. ""But we're going to show that Miami Beach is not going to sit back and go underwater.""|||- - -|||Representatives from more than 190 countries will gather in Paris in December to try to agree on international strategies for dealing with climate change. They will be spurred by their own alarm at a succession of storms, droughts, and heat waves affecting millions of people on the planet, and by outside calls, such as the moral edict from Pope Francis, to care more about the world.|||The record of past such meetings is not encouraging. But the representatives will arrive as progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, often overlooked, has been mounting:|||- Wind and solar power generation are bounding ahead faster than the most optimistic predictions, with a fivefold increase worldwide since 2004. More than 1 in 5 buildings in countries such as Denmark, Germany, Sweden, and even Albania are now powered by renewable energy.|||- The US saw its greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2007. They have fallen about 10 percent since, and are roughly on course to meet President Obama's pledge to reduce emissions in the next 10 years by about 27 percent from their peak.|||- China, the world's largest carbon emitter, paradoxically leads the world in installed wind and solar power, and is charging ahead on renewables. China and the US ended their impasse over who is most responsible to fix global warming, agreeing in November to mutually ambitious goals. Experts say China already has cut coal consumption by 8 percent this year, and the environmental group Greenpeace says China stopped construction of some new coal power plants.|||- Worldwide, carbon dioxide emissions, a principal component of greenhouse gases, did not grow in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. Emissions remained flat even as the global economy grew - an important milestone.|||- Coal-fired power plants are being replaced rapidly by natural gas plants, which are cleaner and emit half the greenhouse gases. Britain saw an 8 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, which is attributed to national energy policies, more energy efficiency, and the switch from coal.|||- Tropical rainforests, which absorb carbon dioxide, are being cut down at a slower rate than in the past - 13 million hectares per year, compared with 16 million in the 1990s, according to the latest figures from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. That is still alarmingly high but shows progress, in part because of vows by big corporations not to buy palm oil grown on deforested lands. Brazil has made notable progress in reducing deforestation of the Amazon.|||In the US, state and local governments are taking bold action even as the national discussion about the looming climate crisis remains paralyzed along political lines. In South Florida, for example, officials of four populous counties shun the rhetoric from GOP presidential aspirants and officials in the state capital and gather regularly to plot cooperative climate change strategy.|||That group, the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, is considered a national model for the kind of shoulder-to- shoulder effort needed to address the problem. They came up with an agreed estimate of sea level rise and identified the most vulnerable areas of the region, and now are plowing through more than 100 recommendations for action.|||""There are no new funding sources coming down from the state or the Feds,"" says Susanne Torriente, assistant city manager for Fort Lauderdale, one of the participants of the compact. ""Would it be good to have state and federal dollars? Yes. Are we going to wait until they act? No.""|||Their cooperation was born, essentially, on the back of a napkin. Kristin Jacobs, now a state representative who was a Broward County commissioner in 2008, was lamenting at the time that the 27 disparate municipal water authorities in the region could not agree on joint action. So she and others came up with the idea of getting local officials together in a classroom.|||""We said, 'Let's have an academy,' "" she recalls, and the Broward Leaders Water Academy began offering elected officials in South Florida six-month courses in water hydraulics and policy. It has now graduated ""three generations of elected officials,"" she says.|||Figuring out what to do about climate change - whether it is building up dunes on the beaches, raising the height of foundations, or shifting developments back from the coastline - takes a cooperative approach. ""We couldn't do it by just saying 'this is the way it is' - the Moses approach,"" Ms. Jacobs says. ""We had to do it with compliance and acquiescence and leadership.""|||Normally, direction on some of these issues might have come from state officials. But not in Florida. Not on climate change.|||""We didn't have to worry about those who don't believe,"" Jacobs says. ""At the end of the day, when the water is overtopping your sea wall, you don't really care that you didn't believe in climate change last week. You do believe in it this week.""|||- - -|||Built on the edge of the sea, Miami Beach is one of the most vulnerable cities in the world to the vicissitudes of the ocean. Its boutique commercial district and canyons of pastel apartments sit on a sieve of porous limestone. The leaky footing was formed over the eons from accumulated seashells, coral, and fish skeletons.|||Today the rock acts as a giant wick, giving the relentless ocean a route for subterranean attack. Seawater pushes in from underground and often gurgles to the surface in inconvenient places. On days of really high tides - even without any rain - the briny invasion turns some city streets into small lakes, snarling traffic and cutting off businesses. Locals call it ""sunny day flooding.""|||The man charged with stopping the sea - or at least getting tourists and residents out of its way - is Carpenter, an affable engineer with a burly physique. Carpenter took over the city's Public Works Department two years ago. His recurring nightmare is of rising seas, frequent storms, and ""king"" tides sweeping through Miami Beach - and doing it in full view of the world. He knows that whatever the city does - or does not do - to prepare for climate change will be tested soon on a stage before a global audience.|||""What we do here is magnified because of who we are,"" he says. Miami Beach thrives on a global reputation for glamour, for cultural fusion, for beaches, for heat - from the sun in the day and its epicurean club culture at night. That's not an image that sits well with flooded streets. But the water is already coming.|||As the Atlantic Ocean warms and expands, fed by melting polar ice caps, the seawater is pushing back into the 330 storm-water pipe outlets designed to drain rain from city streets. So Miami Beach is in the process of installing as many as 80 pumps, at a cost of nearly $400 million, to make sure the water flows outward.|||""If the seas are continuing to rise, and the tidal events are higher than the inland elevation, we have to pump,"" says Carpenter.|||The city plans to raise the level of 30 percent of its streets, encouraging businesses to abandon or remodel their first floors to go to a higher level. Carpenter says he wanted to go up nearly six feet, but town officials said ""we are going too fast."" So they settled on just over three feet.|||""I don't think this is where we want to be long-term, but it's enough to get us through the next 10 or 20 years,"" he says, while standing on a new section of road at Sunset Harbor, looking down at the cafe tables on the sidewalk below, where the street used to be.|||Mayor Levine echoes the importance of dealing with the future encroachment of the sea - now. ""We did not ask for climate change or sea level rise,"" he says. ""But we are the tip of the spear. We don't debate the reason why; we just come up with solutions.""|||Forty miles to the north, past Fort Lauderdale, Randy Brown and his utilities staff in Pompano Beach are also trying to halt the sea. Like the rest of South Florida, the coastal city of 100,000 residents is confronting the ocean above and below ground.|||They are burying a new network of water pipes - painted grape purple - running to businesses and homes. The pipes contain sewer water that has been treated to remove the smell and bacteria and then siphoned from a pipe that used to discharge it into the sea.|||Pompano Beach residents use the water for their lawns and gardens, bypassing the restrictive bans on lawn sprinkling. This recycled water then trickles down into the Biscayne Aquifer.|||Cleansed as it sifts through the ground, it helps reduce the shrinking of the freshwater aquifer, which is being drawn down by the town's 26 wells and is threatened by underground salt water pushed inland by the rising sea level. Homeowners pay about two- thirds less for the recycled water than they do for potable water.|||When city officials first laid out the program at a public meeting, bringing a cake to set a neighborly tone, ""it was a fiasco. [Residents] called it dangerous,"" chuckles Maria Loucraft, a utilities manager.|||Now, people ""say they can't wait for it to get to their area,"" adds Isabella Slagle, who goes to public events with a mascot, a purple-colored sprinkler head with sunglasses, named ""Squirt"" by elementary school students.|||Green lawns trump the political arguments over climate change, says Mr. Brown. ""We don't say 'climate change,' "" he admits. ""It's 'protecting resources' or 'sustainability.' That way, you can duck under the political radar.""|||Some don't want to avoid the radar. Last October, the South Miami City Commission voted to create ""South Florida"" and secede from the rest of the state, in part because, they said, the state government in Tallahassee was not responding to their pleas to help them deal with climate change.|||""It got a lot of press but nobody in the state took it very seriously,"" muses the mayor, Philip Stoddard, over a sandwich on the campus of Florida International University, where he is a biology professor. ""But it did get people talking about climate change.""|||""My house is at 10 feet elevation,"" he adds. ""My wife and I - our question is - will we be able to live out our lives in our house? I'm 58. We don't know. It's going to be a close one. If you look at the official sea level projections, they keep going up, which is a little disquieting. If you look at the unofficial projections, they scare the hell out of you.""|||While South Florida is a leader at local cooperation, officials in towns and cities across the country are struggling to react to a warming climate. Many municipalities have drafted action plans. Boston is converting its taxis to hybrids and requires new buildings to be built with higher foundations. Chicago is planting green gardens on city roofs to reduce the air conditioning needed to cool buildings. Seattle is helping residents install solar panels. Montpelier, Vt., vows to eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2030. Houston is laying down ""cool pavements"" made of reflective and porous material, and planting trees for shade.|||Governors and state legislators across the country have gotten the message, too. While Congress will not debate the ""Big Fix"" - putting a price or a cap on carbon pollution - some states are already doing it. About 30 percent of Americans live in states that have rules capping carbon dioxide emissions and markets that allow companies to buy and sell carbon credits.|||In addition, 28 states have set mandatory quotas for renewable energy from their electric utilities. Seven states have set ambitious targets for overall greenhouse gas reductions - California has promised a reduction of 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.|||""The best thing Congress can do right now is stay out of the way,"" says Anna Aurilio, director of the Washington office of the nonprofit advocacy group Environment America. Between the state efforts and the executive orders by Mr. Obama, she says, the US is on track to meet the administration's greenhouse gas goals.|||""When we look at programs currently in place or set to be implemented, we can come close to the US commitment"" of a 27 percent decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 10 years, she says. ""But we know we have to go much, much further.""|||To get near the goal of keeping average global warming at 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or less, climatologists predict that countries must largely abandon the fossil fuels that have driven technological societies since the Industrial Age - achieving an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.|||That is an imposing goal, since billions of dollars are invested in new and existing fossil fuel power plants that can last 30 to 50 years. Even if solar or wind energy is cheaper than coal, oil, and natural gas, the owners of fossil fuel plants will be reluctant to abandon their investments. But the decisions are starting to come from the people, not just governments or corporations.|||""When you have enough action taking place at the grass roots, sometimes that's a more effective means of implementing change on a large scale,"" says Penn State's Mr. Mann.|||- - -|||Nicole Hammer is one of the foot soldiers in the new war on global warming. A biologist, consultant, and former assistant director of a university center on climate change, she quit and decided to work with nonprofit groups, including the Moms Clean Air Force, an organization that campaigns to stem air pollution and climate change.|||""I realized we have more than enough science to take action on climate change,"" she says while walking at an ecology park near her home in Vero Beach, Fla. ""People who normally wouldn't be involved in environmental issues are starting to speak out.""|||She believes community involvement is the key to solutions, because the problems are felt most keenly at that level. ""We have people in communities who have to put their kids in shopping carts to get across flooded streets to get food,"" she says. ""When you see that happening - and then you see people at high levels denying it - it's disappointing and it's incredibly frustrating.""|||Public outcry has helped close coal-burning power plants, which produce the dirtiest energy. Coal plants now provide about one- third of the electricity in the US - down from more than half in 1990. Tightening pollution standards and cheaper natural gas prices have prompted utilities to close 200 coal-fired plants since 2010, the Sierra Club estimates, and the trend would only accelerate under new clean air regulations unveiled by Obama in early August.|||Until recently, one argument against closing coal plants was that if the US didn't burn its own abundant coal reserves, they would just be exported to China. But Chinese authorities are so sobered by their public's resentment of the thick coal soot and industrial pollution that they are turning with startling speed to renewables. China reached a significant agreement with the US in November to cap its greenhouse gas pollutions by 2030, and further impressed experts in July by promising to ramp up renewables to provide 20 percent of its power, a sharp turn away from its pace of bringing a new coal power plant on line every 10 days.|||""China has become a policy innovator,"" says Nathaniel Keohane, vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, who worked on international climate issues in the Obama administration.|||Other countries are plotting their own ways to curb greenhouse gases. Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain are ramping up solar energy. France has embraced nuclear. Denmark, Portugal, and Nicaragua led in wind power in 2014. Brazil is adding hydroelectric plants as well as sharply reducing deforestation. Kenya and Turkey are tapping geothermal power. And smaller countries such as Costa Rica, Iceland, and Paraguay have found financial and tourism benefits in being at or very near ""carbon neutral.""|||Still, the current projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on when the world will see a significant decline in global emissions vary widely - from about 2030 to after 2100 - based on guesses of how countries respond. But the dramatic shift to natural gas in the US, and the racehorse expansion of hydraulic fracturing to get it, are demonstrations that if new technologies are profitable, industries can pivot quickly.|||""We can make that turn,"" Mr. Keohane predicts. ""Imagine the day when emissions are falling instead of rising. Imagine when we are winning rather than losing.""|||While US leaders remain bogged down in debate over global warming, local communities are acting on their own to hold back rising seas. Witness Miami Beach's elevated streets."
Nature's last refuge: climate change threatens our most fragile ecosystem,Denmark,"An Arctic voyage through the awe-inspiring Northwest Passage shows that, with oil drilling in the far north on the way, rapid action is needed to protect the region|||The Northwest Passage is not an obvious choice for a holiday cruise. It is, after all, one of the most notorious ocean routes. Many hundreds of sailors died in opening up the seaway, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via the Canadian Arctic, before it was conquered just over a century ago.|||But the Arctic today is changing. Global warming is altering it at a rate that is unmatched anywhere else on Earth, and a journey once considered grotesquely dangerous has become a voyage now feasible for the inquiring traveller. Today you can sail through the Northwest Passage, as I did last week, on a ship that offers hot-tubs, bars and restaurants, albeit with armed protection against polar bears and kit for keeping out the cold.|||Related: Journey through the Northwest Passage – in pictures[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/aug/30/journey-through-the-northwest-passage-in-pictures]|||By contrast, in 1845 John Franklin’s expedition to find the Northwest Passage was utterly defeated by the Arctic, even though his ships, the Erebus and Terror, were equipped with steam-powered engines, tinned food and other wonders of 19th-century technology. Trapped in the ice for several years, all 129 men on board died, many resorting to cannibalism as the end neared.|||But 170 years on, ships have strengthened hulls, global positioning receivers, radar and powerful engines. Hence the ease with which our liner – the Akademik Sergey Vavilov research vessel, operated by One Ocean Expeditions[http://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/] – made its 12-day, 1,945-nautical-mile journey from Kangerlussuaq in Western Greenland, across Baffin Bay, on to desolate Beechey Island (where some of Franklin’s men are buried), down through the Bellot Strait and past King William Island – near where the wreck of the Erebus was discovered last year – and into the little port of Cambridge Bay.|||Most of the voyage was made on seas generally free of ice and which were as calm as mill ponds, revealing some of the world’s most bleakly beautiful landscapes: mist-shrouded cliffs, ice floes that stretch to the horizon, and aboriginal settlements, some of them thousands of years old.|||However, there is another factor that made this journey possible, one that reveals the darker side of humanity’s scientific might and which provides the most intriguing aspect of any Arctic visit. Every year our factories and cars pump billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and emissions continue to rise remorselessly. As a result, our planet is heating at a worrying rate, with the Arctic bearing the brunt of temperature rises[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/17/antarctica-sea-ice-record-high-arctic-sixth-lowest-extent].|||Every year the melting of sea ice in the far north starts earlier and earlier and it is now vanishing at a rate of about 13% per decade. As a result, the Arctic’s sea ice cap has shrunk by nearly a third since 1979, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre[http://nsidc.org/]. Finding enough ice in which to get trapped is becoming the Arctic’s real problem.|||That erosion of ice is likely only to worsen, scientists warn. Ice reflects radiation. But if it disappears, and reveals below it the Arctic’s dark waters, which are much better than ice at absorbing heat, less and less solar radiation will be reflected back into space and the Arctic will warm up even more. Indeed, many scientists now believe the Arctic could be free of sea ice in summer within a few decades.|||It is difficult to assess what will be the consequences. Most experts believe they will be profoundly damaging. As Eric Solomon, director of Arctic programmes for the Vancouver Aquarium, puts it: “Sea ice is the foundation for life here.” In removing that foundation, humanity is carrying out a highly dangerous experiment – on a colossal scale.|||Consider the simple issue of algae. It grows on the underside of sea ice and is eaten by krill, which is then eaten by Arctic cod, which in turn is eaten by seals. Take away the bottom rung of this food chain and all sorts of unintended consequences could be realised.|||Then there are the narwhals. These tusked whales – sometimes called the unicorns of the sea – are prized by Inuits who use their blubber and skin to make a traditional, extraordinarily chewy meal called muktuk. (It’s an acquired taste, I discovered.) Narwhals can hide, safely, in sea ice and so avoid their natural predator, the killer whale. Robbed of that protection, narwhal numbers could dwindle dangerously, marine biologists warn.|||Polar bears are also likely to suffer. These creatures are magnificent hunters. They can smell their favourite prey, ringed seals, from more than a kilometre, even though the seals may be hiding under snow. It is thought there are about 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic, made up of separate populations in 20 different regions. Unfortunately there have been few long-term studies of Ursus maritimus and half of these different populations are simply rated as being in an uncertain status.|||However, in well-studied populations, such as those around the town of Churchill, on the Hudson Bay, research indicates that the body sizes of polar bears – and their birthrates – are declining as the climate warms. “This does not bode well,” says Canadian naturalist Franco Mariotti.|||Then there is the impact on humans. For Inuits, sea ice not only helps protect the local food chain, it acts as a highway on which they can ride their skiddoos and dog sleds to hunt and to visit friends. Disappearing ice means increasing fragmentation of local communities and limits the ability of people to hunt. This problem is only likely to get worse as the region is opened for mining and oil drilling.|||This month Barack Obama gave final approval for Shell to drill into potential oil reserves beneath the sea floor of the Arctic Ocean[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/18/shell-gets-final-clearance-to-begin-drilling-for-oil-in-the-arctic]. The move was denounced as “potentially catastrophic” by Greenpeace, while Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, a US environmental organisation, said the decision “goes against science, the will of the people and common sense”.|||Concerns have been raised over Shell’s ability to clean up a spill, should one occur, in an area covered by sea ice for much of the year. If one considers the example of the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico,[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/02/bp-will-pay-largest-environmental-fine-in-us-history-for-gulf-oil-spill] it took 87 days to cap, even though it happened in a fairly accessible region. In the Arctic, which is virtually impenetrable in winter, a similar gusher would be far more difficult to tackle. More to the point, the region’s ecology is about the most fragile on the planet and would be far more vulnerable to the impact of a major spill.|||Take the landscape on the south shore of Devon Island. At 74° north, it is swept by ferocious, freezing gales which, in winter, send temperatures plunging to minus 50C. The island has a polar desert climate with hardly any precipitation.|||Yet life clings to this bleak wilderness. My walk there a few days ago revealed an astonishing array of plants hugging the ground to survive: willows, which grow as trees in the UK but which, up here, shrink up to the size of twigs to keep out of the gales. In addition, the Arctic campion, or lantern flower, provides unique protection for its seeds, housed in a minuscule globe that acts like a greenhouse. These adaptations are vivid illustrations of life’s extraordinary resilience, though they would be quite incapable of withstanding any major environmental disaster.|||Related: Can Shell afford Arctic oil? | Karl Mathiesen[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/can-shell-afford-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic]|||Across Lancaster Sound, the lowering cliffs of Prince Leopold Island provide another demonstration of the vulnerability of the region’s wildlife. The steep cliffs of this Unesco world heritage site provide refuge for thousands of black-legged kittiwakes, fulmars, black guillemots and thick-billed murre, creating a vast, mist-shrouded citadel of screaming, winged wildlife. The island is one of the world’s most important refuges for migratory birds and again is highly vulnerable, as so many other areas of the Arctic, to ecological mishap.|||It is not just the risk that oil drilling poses to the Arctic that causes consternation, however. It is the extraordinary notion that it is a good idea to take advantage of a problem that has been caused by our over-dependence on fossil fuels – by drilling for even more fossil fuel. Hence Friends of the Earth’s furious denunciation of the decision to let the Arctic’s pristine Chukchi Sea[http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/12/can-shell-afford-to-drill-for-oil-in-the-arctic] “become an energy sacrifice zone [that will only] worsen climate disruption”.|||The real problem that faces the Arctic is its uncertain political status, a point that is clearly demonstrated by comparing the region with its southerly counterpart, the Antarctic. The latter is controlled by the Antarctic Treaty, which bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military. It also strictly controls all environmental hazards. By contrast, the Arctic is owned by a ragbag of nations – Russia, Canada, the US, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark (through its dependency, Greenland) – which have very different ideas about how to run the place and which have shown no inclination to outlaw mining or oil drilling or impose cast-iron environmental controls.|||Apart from the environmental risks that they pose, increasing mining and drilling operations will have many other consequences. Ships will end up crisscrossing the region for increasing numbers of days. The Inuits’ icy highways will be broken up even more while the region’s bowhead, blue and beluga whales face the prospect of their underwater communications being disrupted or blocked in these once quiet waters.|||Rubbish is also a problem. In Antarctica, every piece of waste is removed from the continent. In the Arctic, no such rule is invoked, as is demonstrated by the container vessels of washing machines and other household goods that arrive in summer as the ice melts and ports like Kangerlussuaq and Sisimuit in Greenland and Port Inlet in Canada open up. These once-a-year imports, booked online months in advance, provide local householders with the means to modernise their homes. Crucially, the containers that brought them return empty. No attempt is made to ship away the old household goods that have been replaced. They are simply left to rust in the air.|||In short, what arrives in the north, stays in the north: a small but significant demonstration of the casual indifference that is adopted when dealing with environmental issues in the region.|||The Arctic remains a place of extraordinary beauty that is inhabited by some of the planet’s most remarkable animals. But time is running out. The region needs protection on the scale that has been meted out to the Antarctic, an idea recently backed by a House of Lords report on the Arctic[http://www.parliament.uk/arcticcom].|||As peers remarked, current approaches to protecting the Arctic are far too hesitant and cautious. In this, they are almost certainly correct. Whether we have time to bring meaningful improvements is a different matter.|||Change is sweeping the far north. Time is not on its side.|||Pressure points|||Global warming is bringing major changes.|||Mining The Arctic contains large quantities of iron ore, copper and nickel and new mines are being planned and constructed to exploit these, raising worries about pollution. Proposals to drill for oil have also triggered concerns about threats to the region’s delicate ecology.|||Tourism Cruise expeditions into the Arctic are expected to expand significantly, bringing in more and more tourists while placing strain on the environment and the region’s few, small towns.|||Politics Control of the region and its transport routes is hotly disputed by the eight Arctic nations. Canada, for example, claims the North west Passage as national sovereign waters. The US says it is an international waterway."

Here’s my question and the reply:|||QUESTION: Thanks for hosting the call, and it’s kind of neat that the President will be above the Arctic Circle; it’s important.|||Two questions. One is about – there’s some environmental groups that are complaining about Arctic drilling approvals that the President has made seem to be in contrast with his concerns about global warming and the statements and recent videos related to the trip. And the other is about the Law of the Sea. Russia has been pushing harder; they had a military presence on the sea ice near the North Pole for the first time this spring and they’ve filed a new claim at the UN, and the U.S. has still not – even though Republican and Democratic presidents have pushed for it – gone ahead with the Law of the Sea ratification. So is that going to be part of his message?|||SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Thank you, Andrew. It’s good to hear from you. Let me address the drilling situation first. What I would say in response to that is yes, there are people who are protesting against the drilling; there are people that are upset and believe that the President has gone too far in terms of opening up the Arctic. There is an equal number of people who believe that the – it has not been opened up enough. And I’m not talking about the oil companies; I’m talking about the citizens of Alaska, and in particular, Alaskan natives. The people of Alaska want sustainable development that also protects the environment. There has to be a balance; the Administration has been taking a balanced approach to this. The Administration has been looking at alternate energy sources, renewable energy sources.|||But at the same time, in a very pragmatic approach, we understand that we’re going to need the petroleum products at least for the foreseeable future, and certain segments of the Chukchi Sea and the Beaufort Sea have been opened up for leases, and the companies that are up there have been doing things under a legal process and with strict review by the Department of Interior and the United States Coast Guard, and that is proceeding.|||So while not everybody’s happy, I think there has been a very balanced approach and Alaskans are interested in development and in fact, for some of them, they don’t think things are moving along fast enough. So as I said, it’s been a balanced approach by the Administration and the fact that we probably have parties on both sides of the issue that are not completely satisfied is probably an indicator that we’re on a fairly safe course here.|||As far as the Law of the Sea and Russian claims, I’ve been articulating this for the last month or so since the Russians have submitted their most recent claim: They are doing things entirely under the process of the Law of the Sea Treaty. They – and in fact, this is not the first time they’ve submitted a claim. They submitted a claim before and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf told them to go back and provide better science documenting their extended continental shelf claim. Much has been made over the fact that their claim includes the North Pole; not much of a fuss was made when Denmark made a similar claim. In fact, their claim encompasses the North Pole and a large section of the Arctic Ocean as well. And I’ve had preliminary looks at what Canada might submit as their claim; it also claims the North Pole and a rather large portion of the Arctic Ocean.|||So for me, it comes as no surprise that the Russians’ claim is so large; they have half the coastline of the Arctic Ocean and they have devoted a lot of science to documenting their claim, and they’re going through the proper process within the Law of the Sea Treaty. And my only regret is that the United States is not able to have standing under that treaty because we have not acceded to it yet. And we at the State Department and the Administration remain hopeful that at some point in the future the Senate will ratify that treaty so that we can become a party in that as well. Thank you.|||Update, Aug. 31, 12:05 p.m. | I moved the update that was here to a new post on how the public tends to focus on political and entertainment angles[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/amid-attacks-over-mountain-names-and-arctic-oil-leases-obama-seeks-alaska-survival-tips-from-bear-grylls/]."
Greenland an icy hothouse of global issues,Denmark,"UUMMANNAQ, Greenland - ""When I was a young man,"" a fisherman named Ole Qvist tells me, ""I was a champion dogsled racer. But now,"" he sighs, ""it takes seven dogs to pull me.""|||I'm unfamiliar with dogs as a measure of weight, but I gather from the way he palms his belly, mounded like his native Greenland's polar ice cap, that seven dogs indicates a serious body-mass index.|||Uummannaq, where Qvist has lived his whole life, is a settlement 400 miles north of the Arctic Circle in western Greenland. The July sun hangs like a fixture spraying light from the top of the world. At midday, it could be midnight. It's a balmy 65 degrees, warm enough for short sleeves and smoothies. Just offshore, an iceberg three stories high and as wide as a small apartment building floats in a fjord like a late delivery from last winter.|||As a child, I'd look on maps at the great wedge of land over America and wonder just what, and who, was there. Later, I flew en route to Europe over its massive ice cap, like a vast desert of frost. That ice, melting and cracking and calving island-size icebergs, has lately focused attention on the world's largest island. As remote from the rest of the planet as it may be, it is a crucible of global issues: As Greenland gets greener, it's becoming a hothouse of change. There is a nationhood movement for independence from Denmark, which has ruled it since 1927 (among Greenland's 57,000 residents are about 7,000 Danes). Economic development and environmentalism, globalization, and heritage grind against one another like the tectonic plates deep below the softening permafrost.|||Yet, as I travel by boat, bus, and foot up the west coast, few people I encounter in settlements seem overly concerned about any of it.|||""We know the climate is changing, but we aren't worried, because we know it is always changing,"" says Salik Hard, 47, a consultant to the government on tourism. ""People in Europe and America have mass hysteria. It's useful for politicians and the media.|||""Listen,"" he says, ""there are good things about the hysteria. Maybe it'll get the West to stop poisoning the seas and oceans. That would be a good thing.""|||In Uummannaq, the dock is busy with fishermen baiting lines, and Qvist, seated on an upturned white bucket, is happy to relax and dilate on the eternal world of Greenlanders - Inuits who crossed continental bridges of ice to the island 4,000 years ago and settled on its littoral fringes. Qvist seems happy about most things. As for global warming, with rivers and channels that no longer freeze, he is enjoying some unexpected benefits: The superb Greenlandic halibut now swim closer to the surface, so he is able to pull up more and bigger fish in a lengthening season.|||But Qvist is not happy about every change.|||""Younger people are too influenced from abroad and want to live like foreigners,"" he says. ""They look down on us fishers and hunters. I understand it's important to get an education, but I'll tell you something, you can be educated . . . and still be unemployed. I don't know any unemployed fishermen.""|||I walk to the other side of the harbor to a cafe where Norah Jones plays on the radio over the hiss of milk being foamed for cappuccino. Here are the people Qvist has in mind. A teenage girl in jeans and sneakers, with turquoise earrings and a blue tattoo just behind her ear, sips an icy fluorescent-yellow drink through a straw.|||A couple, Winnie and Jens, occupy a table. Winnie wears wraparound sunglasses. One of Jen's biceps is covered by a tattoo. They look like visiting Europeans. In fact, they own the cafe and have always lived here. The Internet brought the world to them, and they want to be part of it.|||""We don't have to choose between being in the world and being Greenlandic,"" Winnie says. ""Life is change; adapting doesn't mean abandoning who you are. It isn't, after all, as if anyone still lives in traditional turf houses.""|||They are Greenlandic in their hearts, they say, and they describe winter in Uummannaq - minus-25-degree average temperatures, three months without sunlight - with a warmth perhaps understood only by those from cold climates. The polar night descends, the aurora borealis spreads its sparkling web of electrified light, and spirits come out. They say they have encountered ghosts and once used shamans to exorcise their home.|||I cast my gaze upon Uummannaq, the 3,900-foot heart-shape mountain from which the village takes its name. For the 1,300 people who live there, the mountain, rose-hued granite and gneiss, represents permanence. What changes is the ice.|||A beam of sunshine seems to set the iceberg just off the dock ablaze with white light.|||""Will that melt in the course of the summer?"" I ask Jens.|||""It will be gone by tomorrow morning,"" he says, ""and a new one will take its place.""|||Up a steep street, I meet two sisters, Bodil and Susanne, sitting on steps outside their house. ""Our mother is getting married on Saturday,"" Bodil says, ""so today is a kafemit. Come in!"" A kafemit is a celebration when people are invited to visit. It's considered rude to say no, but, anyway, I want to go in.|||Inside the house, a modest-size place, a dining table is laid with a spread of desserts, something white and creamy thickly laden with sweetened fresh raspberries, a cake, and a pavlova.|||An uncle had just killed a narwhal, a medium-size, one-tusked whale. It was a lucky catch, as it wasn't the season. They show me the butchered meat, which fills every space in the refrigerator and freezer.|||Susanne, the younger sister, doesn't enjoy visiting Uummannaq, which she considers a backwater after Nuuk, Greenland's capital, where they have lived since 2005. There are no flush toilets. The dogs smell. Down at the harbor, it smells.|||They link arms for a photo, and I write down their names. They ask for mine.|||Bodil asks, ""Are you on Facebook?""|||Everyone is taught that Iceland is green and Greenland is ice.|||Despite global warming, most of Greenland is still ice, which covers 95 percent of its land mass, or 660,000 square miles. At the summit of its ice sheet, the ice piles two miles high and has pressed the land beneath it almost 1,200 feet below sea level. Antarctica has almost 85 percent of the world's ice; Greenland has 12 percent - 35 times more than Alaska.|||No surprise, the Greenlandic language, which is Inuit - people there can communicate with Inuits from Alaska - has a prodigious vocabulary for ice, words that describe pack ice, melting ice, ridged ice, and rime, ice that stretches across vast expanses, ice in all its forms on the surface of water.|||The ice has architecture. There are pyramids and ziggurats, towers, colonnades, and arches. Some massive icebergs sit on foundations of refulgent blue, or enormous crystalline plinths. Sometimes, they seem sculpted into images. From a distance, one looks like a sailor with a rain-soaked sailor's hat, and as I get close, it still looks like a sailor with a rain-soaked sailor's hat. The water is as calm and cold as a cryogenic bath, and yet, because the air is warm, the bergs are sweating curtains of rain.|||The Ilulissat Icefjord is a vast field of icebergs calved from Sermeq Kujalleq, the northern hemisphere's most productive glacier. This is Greenland as I imagined it would be.|||I see one iceberg, 40 feet long and 20 feet high, convex and ridged like a clam shell, that is a miracle of translucence and clarity, light cascading through its surfaces so that it makes the water all around it sparkling and lambent.|||Only 10 percent of an iceberg is visible. Above the surface, they can be the size of aircraft carriers. They don't melt evenly, so they often become unbalanced, rocking back and forth until they break, or tilt and flip, sometimes triggering tsunamis.|||Or they present other dangers. A little more than a hundred years ago, one floated down from Ilulissat into the northern Atlantic, where it collided with an ocean liner called the Titanic.|||Now, Greenland is becoming green.|||In the south, people are planting forests and growing potatoes. Qvist's laissez faire attitude about the climate seems typical among the Greenlanders I meet.|||At the Jakobshavn, another great glacier, I walk through town to find a trailhead, which runs over meadows carpeted by luminous grasses and wildflowers, purple mountain avens, poppies, and buttercups. The lushness is normal, not a symptom of climate change.|||The settlement, with modular houses painted in bright reds, yellows, blues, and greens, feels fantastically isolated. At its edge, that feeling gives way to an expanse that is wonderfully open and free.|||This feeling is what Greenlanders cherish, and it's what they say they want for themselves. But apart from fishing, prospects to develop a viable economy are limited, and their best hopes - namely, natural resources including rare-earth minerals, gold, and oil - are trapped under all that ice. In short, warmer temperatures may unlock the gate to independence from Denmark, and to statehood.|||Even as indigenous people elsewhere, such as the island states of the South Pacific, stand to lose everything, Greenlanders see possible benefits.|||I ask Salik whether access to the resources influences how people see the issue.|||""The ball is rolling for independence, and you cannot stop it,"" he says. ""Even if there is another ice age, we will have it. And if global warming speeds up the process, so be it.""|||Todd Pitock, a Philadelphia writer, won the Society of American Travel Writers' 2015 Lowell Thomas Award as Travel Journalist of the Year."

'The whale at Lagoon Walk, which was further out on its own, moved overnight in the high tide so it is now further up the beach.|||'We are preparing to move the whales, but it won't be today.

We are almost there but we have to do it properly.|||'We are putting sand on them this afternoon because if we don't they could move further along the beach where it might be more difficult to reach them.'|||The bodies of the whales were cordoned off by council workers in a bid to protect the carcasses as they are examined by scientists trying to work out why they died.|||A build-up of methane gas later caused one of the whales to explode as marine biologists collecting samples for a post-mortem examination cut at its skin and blubber, with shocked witnesses describing a bang and a 'huge blast of air' followed by a foul stench.|||The three whale carcasses were found on the Skegness beach on Sunday morning, after another was washed up on beach in Hunstantonm, Norfolk, last Friday.|||A fifth whale was also found at former RAF bombing range in nearby Wainfleet - five miles from Skegness - last Monday, and is believed to be from the same pod.|||Graffiti has been sprayed on the bodies of two of the whales on the beach near Gibraltar Point in Skegness. Messages reading 'Fukushima RIP', 'CND' and 'man's fault' have been written in white lettering on the bodies of the whales.|||Scientists from the Zoological Society of London were carrying out post mortem examinations on the whales yesterday, and experts are investigating whether the group are linked to 12 sperm whales that have washed up on the Dutch island of Texel and the German islands of Wangerooge and Helgoland since January 11.|||Samples have been collected from four of the five whales, but the team from the Zoological Society were struggling to reach the fifth whale, which was washed up yesterday on a former Ministry of Defence bombing range, which could contain live explosives.|||The samples will then be brought back to London to be analysed in the hope that this could explain why the whales died.|||It is thought that the sperm whales accidentally entered the North Sea - where the sea floor is not particularly deep.|||As the animals rely on sonar to navigate, when they end up in a shallow sandy seabed, they can become disorientated and die.|||Richard Johnson of the UK Coastguard said: 'We believe that the three whales at Skegness died at sea and then washed ashore.|||'We are advising members of the public to stay away from the beach.

The men on the ice,Denmark,"The men are the remaining applicants to Denmark's celebrated annual Sledge Patrol Sirius (Slaedepatruljen Sirius), a unique special forces dog sled unit charged with patrolling and policing the 8,699-mile coastline of Northeast Greenland National Park -- the world's largest and northernmost wilderness.|||MESTERSVIG, GREENLAND|||Twelve men toe the line just minutes before 7 p.m. The temperature is minus 20 C, the warmest it's been all day. There is still no wind -- a rare reprieve for late February high above the Arctic Circle. Egon, a young sled dog chained near the station's flight tower, sees the men, stands to stretch, and then begins to howl into the vast silence.|||The men are the remaining applicants to Denmark's celebrated annual Sledge Patrol Sirius (Slaedepatruljen Sirius), a unique special forces dog sled unit charged with patrolling and policing the 8,699-mile coastline of Northeast Greenland National Park -- the world's largest and northernmost wilderness. Of the 12, eight are applying to the sledge patrol, while the other four are candidates to become station specialists, highly trained officers who provide necessary operational and logistical support to the dog sled teams as well as other branches of the Danish military.|||The candidates on the line are all in their early 20s and have been in Mestersvig, one of three small Danish military stations in the park, for nearly a month. Their winter survival course is a required component of an eight-month training program called forskole, a term that directly translates as preschool but means a type of preparatory school in Danish. The forskole includes coursework in fields as varied as mechanics, first aid, shooting, firefighting, carpentry, cooking, and sewing.|||Tonight they begin their final challenge of the winter training: a grueling overnight, 100-kilometer trek across the snow and ice on cross-country skis for the Sirius patrol candidates. That's two and a half times the distance of the Boston Marathon -- in the dark and cold, at the end of the earth. Station specialist applicants only have to go half that distance. The march will take place on a 5-kilometer circular course that begins and ends at the station's flight tower. It will take up to 24 hours to complete. Candidates must complete the march to continue in the selection process, but it doesn't guarantee they'll make the cut.|||Greenland was a colony of Denmark until 1953, attained home rule status in 1979, and advanced autonomy in June 2009. But for the foreseeable future, the country's financial, national security, civil rights, and justice affairs sectors remain under Danish jurisdiction. This includes policing authority. As the Arctic country becomes a geopolitical hot spot of energy development and an increasingly popular tourist destination, additional demands are being placed on the men of Sirius, whose primary function is to maintain Danish sovereignty in the frozen, desolate expanses.|||But it is becoming less desolate by the day. Climbers and kayakers and adventurers are applying in greater numbers for travel permits to explore the region's pristine mountains and waters. With the late-spring melt, come more and more tourist-laden cruise ships navigating the iceberg-mined fjords. At the same time, the prominence of Greenland in global climate change and climate research has brought many more researchers and scientists to the area.|||While it's not yet exactly crowded at the top of the world, it's becoming busier.|||Greenland's economic development may improve as a result of all of these developments, but the increased traffic in Northeast Greenland National Park presents potential logistical and structural problems to the sledge patrol unit -- the sole policing authority in a region the size of France and Germany combined.|||In the event that a cruise ship were to graze an iceberg, what could Sirius do? What would happen if an unarmed climate researcher is mauled by a polar bear? No hospital or services exist for thousands of miles. And, although mining and oil exploration have long been financially and technologically impossible or unsustainable in the region, warming temperatures and developments in technology may open more efficient pathways to exploration and extraction in Northeast Greenland. If an environmental disaster were to occur, what could Denmark -- and, more specifically, the men of Sirius -- do to contain it?|||The men are not adequately supplied and their numbers too few to effectively meet challenges of such magnitude. Yet they continue to do what they've always done and what their role demands -- train and prepare for any eventuality.|||Earlier in the day, Rufus Gifford, the US ambassador to Denmark, and Army Major Michael Wise, a delegate from the US embassy in Copenhagen, met several of the current Sirius patrolmen and station specialists in Mestersvig. Both men were set to travel by dog sled and camp overnight on the frozen Kong Oscar Fjord with patrolmen Anders Kjaergaard, Sebastian Vestergaard, and their dog teams.|||Gifford, who had made five previous trips to other parts of the country, talked about the reasons for this trip at lunch. ""Part of my job is to maintain strength between two key NATO allies. I am regularly in a situation where I [ask] the Danish government to increase their defense spending or send their F-16s and/or special operations forces into a conflict zone,"" Gifford said. ""I want to have greater context. I want to see how Denmark invests its money, and I want to have a greater understanding and appreciation for their current capability. I have spent time with two other elite branches of the Danish military -- the Frogmen and the Jaeger Corps -- so I wanted to spend with the third and most unique branch."" Greenland has become increasingly central to the ambassador's work since the United States assumed the Arctic Council Chair in 2015.|||During the meal, Frederik Oxlund, leader of the forskole, explained that the 100-kilometer march is based on the greatest midpoint distance between outposts. In the event that a man should lose his partner, sledge, and dogs between two stations, he needs to know that he can survive by walking to the nearest one. ""If a man has made the march once,"" Oxlund said, ""he knows that he can do it again.""|||On patrol, Sirius men always work in teams, which is also how they train, except for the march. ""This is actually the only real test of the individual. This is a single man against nature."" Oxlund smiled, and added, ""It's a great test for the students, a tough walk.""|||Thomas ""Hansi"" Hansen, chief instructor of the winter training, strides before the men in formation, ticking off the list of rules: No talking with one another. The instructors and Dr. Peter Ric-Hansen, who will monitor the men during the march, may ask them questions, but trainees may answer only yes or no. They are given a radio and flare gun to signal for help, a weapon, and 200 grams of chocolate, their only food for the duration of the march. Oxlund checks the men's layers, their weapons, and headlamps. No one has questions.|||At the strike of 7 p.m. Johan (cadets are allowed to be identified in public only by their first names) skis off into the night. There is no fanfare and no talking -- even Egon has stopped howling. Every five minutes, another man begins his march. By 8 p.m., all 12 are coasting on the circular course around the station. An hour later, the mercury has fallen to minus 22 C.|||Each time a man returns to the start line, the instructors rush out for a quick check. Candidates are offered a cup of warm water or juice, while Ric-Hansen checks for signs of frostbite or what he calls that ""faraway"" look. ""We are at the limit here,"" he says. ""If I see someone out there sleeping or something, I can alert the instructors. I also watch their time. One guy whose previous lap times are 55 minutes, 56 minutes, 58 minutes, and then suddenly the next lap is an hour and 20 minutes, is this because he was taking a break or eating? Did he get off the track because he had to go the bathroom, or has he been standing still or sleeping? Did he fall? Out there, if you lie down for even 20 minutes . . . "" The doctor trails off and shakes his head.|||By 11 p.m. the temperature has fallen again, to minus 25 C, and the first tendrils of the northern lights flare high in the sky. The lights quickly grow stronger and deeper in color, until the bright recognizable neon green of the aurora borealis stretches over the peaks of the Stauning Alps in the west to the mountains of Traill O across the icy fjord where Gifford, Wise, and the sledge teams are camped. Beneath the dancing electrons colliding with the upper atmosphere, and far from the station, the solitary beams of the marchers' headlamps bob and glide across the snowy, darkened plain.|||It is still dark when the first station specialist, cadet Kasper, approaches the finish line on his last lap around 5 a.m. The instructors, support staff, and doctor are almost giddy. They jump into motion and stretch a pennant banner of paper flags across the finish line. An instructor, Jesper Hoffman, stands facing the oncoming candidate. Behind his back, Hoffman holds a full-sized cloth Dannebrog, Denmark's red flag with the white Scandinavian cross. As Kasper skis by, Hoffman turns and drapes the flag over the skier's shoulders. The cadet smiles and crosses the finish line. The men break into applause.|||Kasper is tired, sore, and cold. He is quickly helped out of his skis and led into a room at the base of the tower where Oxlund and Hansen assist him in removing his boots and the many layers of clothing. Between the outer and mid-layers of clothing, ice has formed from his body's perspiration. When Oxlund removes the man's boots there are blisters but no frostbite.|||Over the next several hours, more men cross the finish line until all the station specialist applicants complete their 50-kilometer march. Each man is similarly celebrated and accompanied into the station tower. Ric-Hansen checks each candidate, and then they're told to go eat and drink.|||In the canteen, cadet Mads, who began his march at 7:45 p.m. and finished at 5:25 a.m., remembers looking up during the night and seeing the northern lights. ""I thought to myself, I'm walking around Northeast Greenland, where few people come,"" he says. ""I realized it was extraordinary. Who gets to do that? I felt kind of lucky."" He yawns. ""But I don't want to do it again tomorrow. Maybe another day.""|||At 10 a.m., Ambassador Gifford and Sledge Team 7 return from their night on the sea ice, where the overnight low had reached minus 32 C. Gifford's beard and eyelashes are caked in frost -- and he's exhausted. ""I would fall asleep for 10 minutes and then wake because my feet were so cold. At times, I would stick my nose out of the sleeping bag, just to get a bit of fresh air. But with one exhale, I could feel the moisture on my beard freeze. After tossing and turning and shivering for nine hours, I probably got a grand total of an hour of interrupted sleep,"" he says.|||Gifford has seen his fair share of fancy new military facilities during his time in the diplomatic services -- often to review the next generation gadgetry. ""There's simply none of that here,"" he says. ""This is one of the most elite military units on earth. Twelve soldiers, their sledge, and their dogs. These guys are all solider and all human, driven by superb commitment.""|||At the finish line, another young Sirius patrol candidate who has been cross-country skiing for 15 hours closes in on another lap. A 4-inch icicle hangs from his bearded chin. It is glazed red by juice given to him throughout the night by Oxlund and Hansen. He has 70 kilometers down and 30 more to go.|||Denver David Robinson is a writer and photographer based in Portland, Ore.|||Credit: By Denver David Robinson|||Caption: The Aurora Borealis flares above Mestersvig Station, a small Danish military post in Northeast Greenland."
Claus Meyer: the other man from Noma,Denmark,"The Danish TV cookery show host and entrepreneur helped create the world’s best restaurant and turn Copenhagen into a leading dining destination. Next stop: New York|||In the centre of Copenhagen is something distinctly un-Danish. Inderhavnsbroen – the Inner Harbour Bridge, or “kissing bridge”, because of two retractable sections that meet in the middle – was due to be finished in 2013, but there were design problems and then the contractor filed for bankruptcy. It earned the nickname the “missing bridge”, a very public failing in such a well-ordered city. A revised opening date for summer 2015 was missed. It should now open this year.|||The bridge will eventually link Nyhavn and Christianshavn: that is, the picturesque, rainbow-fronted city centre and a more edgy district that is home to the hippyish Christiania commune. Or, if you have come to Copenhagen for the food – which, statistics suggest, you probably have – it will provide a handy shortcut between Claus Meyer’s the Standard and René Redzepi[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/rene-redzepi] ’s Noma.|||Meyer and Redzepi are the two most influential figures in the Nordic food revolution[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/scandinavian-food-and-drink] ; though you can be forgiven if you are only familiar with the latter. It was Meyer’s idea that a restaurant might be inspired, rather than restricted, by the limited produce in Nordic countries. He approached Paul Cunningham, an English chef based in the city but he declined and suggested a shortlist including Redzepi, then a 25-year-old sous chef. Noma opened in 2003, with Meyer and Redzepi as partners; within two years Redzepi had won a Michelin star and the accolades have scarcely stopped since.|||In Denmark, Meyer needs no introduction: he was the host of a popular TV cooking show and the 52-year-old entrepreneur now has an empire that includes books, delis, bakeries, a country hotel and high-end restaurants. The latest of these is the Standard, an art-deco building that was once Copenhagen’s Customs House and contains an informal cafe, a pan-Indian restaurant, jazz club and Michelin-starred operation called Studio. He’s also a philanthropist, working with prisoners in Denmark and in 2013 opening Gustu in La Paz, Bolivia, South America’s poorest country, with the promise, like Noma, to cook only with indigenous ingredients.|||Related: Gustu, Bolivia: the surprise restaurant venture by Noma's Claus Meyer[http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/13/gustu-restaurant-la-paz-bolivia-review]|||But – if you believe the gossip – the founders of new Nordic cuisine have become estranged. Redzepi told the Wall Street Journal in 2013[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/SB10001424052702303914304579192251690597682] that he became so frustrated that he gave Meyer an ultimatum: “It’s you or me, Claus.” The discussion ended with Meyer selling a chunk of his majority stake in Noma – he still retains 20% – to an American investor and Redzepi becoming the main owner. Sitting either side of the water, failing to meet in the middle, their faltering relationship has more than a little in common with the kissing bridge.|||On a frigid, blue-skied morning in January, Meyer does not come across like a man with a grudge. He is a strapping 6ft-plus in a tight black T-shirt and charcoal trousers. He moved to New York City a few months ago to oversee the ambitious opening this spring of a food hall and brasserie in Vanderbilt Hall, the old waiting room in Grand Central Terminal, but he is back on a flying visit to promote his new cookbook. He has published more than a dozen recipe collections in Danish, but The Nordic Kitchen is his first in English.|||Does Meyer feel that he has received the credit he deserves for helping to make Nordic cuisine so exciting? “It’s a good question,” he says, his eyes scanning from the jazz club where we sit towards Noma, scarcely 200 metres across the water. “Sometimes I think no. I felt in the beginning in New York: ‘Nobody knows me and René has got all the credit for a number of reasons.’ But in the last couple of months, I’ve really come to understand that a lot of people know who I am and recognise what I’ve been doing. They don’t underestimate my contribution.”|||Relations with Redzepi, Meyer insists, are cordial and he is effusively complimentary about his invention and artistic expression: “When I met René, I didn’t see the unpolished diamond he was. I didn’t see that at all.” Meyer laughs. “So the mature answer would be to say, ‘No, I think I get the recognition I deserve.’ And I like to think René deserves much of what he gets.”|||In the introduction to The Nordic Kitchen, Meyer attempts to piece together the origins of the food revolution that he helped to create. It’s a fascinating tale that takes in powdered potatoes, onanism and Lars von Trier. It is also a terrific underdog story: one not just about food, but about economic and cultural development. It is estimated that 10,000 jobs have been created in the restaurant industry in Copenhagen in the last decade. Noma – rated the best restaurant in the world four times since 2010 – had to build an elaborate rock garden outside to deter tourists from gawping in through the windows.|||Meyer describes the first 19 years of his life in the south of Denmark as “a culinary nightmare, the darkest period in Danish food history”. Doctors and puritanical priests had, for centuries, lobbied against sensual, pleasure-giving food. “The idea of preparing delicious meals for your loved ones was a sin in line with eccentric dancing, abuse of alcohol, incest and masturbation,” Meyer says.|||The situation was especially dire in Meyer’s home. His father didn’t want children and never loved him – he relates this information with a brisk matter-of-factness that is perhaps uniquely Scandinavian – and his parents separated when he was 13. His mother became an alcoholic and food, never a priority, became an afterthought. This only changed when Meyer went to France to work as an au pair and wound up living with a fourth-generation baker and traiteur and his wife in Gascony.|||“I thought, ‘What the fuck have we been eating for 19 years?’” he recalls. “If you can eat foie gras, brioche, fresh baguette baked twice a day. In Denmark, I ate two-week-old sandwich bread full of additives and now I’ve got a baguette that made me cry with pleasure.”|||The revelation was deeper than that, though. “What I learned was that if your parents cook shitty food out of shitty ingredients, well, maybe they end up living shitty lives,” says Meyer. “And kids are suffering from that. But apparently if you make the most wonderful food, then maybe life becomes great. I want to tell that story in Denmark!”|||When Meyer returned to Denmark in the early 1980s, he believed his “mission in life” was to introduce French food to his homeland. After deciding there was only so much he could achieve as a chef, he earned a spot on TV and imported foie gras, truffles and olive oil. Meyer shakes his head: “Then 15, 16 years down the road, I realised I’d got it wrong.”|||This is where the film-makers Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, fellow Danes who created the Dogme 95 movement, came in. Believing that if they competed with Hollywood on their terms, they would always lose, they chose to operate outside the system. Meyer thinks that this, to a degree, is what he and Redzepi achieved with Noma. “We redefined the concept of luxury,” says Meyer. “We said luxury can be about a perfect leaf of dandelion picked in the right place at the right moment and treated as carefully as you would treat foie gras. Suddenly, we were able to be part of the game. That’s exactly like the Dogme brothers. Foie gras to beetroot – to me that is like Hollywood to Danish film-making! And the rest is history.”|||Related: How the Dogme manifesto reinvented Denmark[http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/nov/25/how-dogme-built-denmark]|||The appetite for high-end Nordic cooking remains voracious. Soon Meyer will open in Grand Central: a 200-cover, $20m operation with 300 employees. More than 750,000 people pass through the terminal every day. “I’ve never tried anything close to it,” Meyer admits. “But if I don’t pull it off, I won’t forgive myself.”|||Meyer could sound like the “serial entrepreneur” that he calls himself, but that would be misunderstanding his conviction that good food can change lives. He explains by talking about how his father loved Elvis Presley, Tarzan movies and Muhammad Ali, sometimes being moved to tears as they sat watching Elvis sing, Tarzan swing and Ali sting. They were the only happy moments they spent together. He says: “I think maybe because I wanted my father to look at me and cry because I was his son, I wanted to be like Ali and Tarzan and I wanted to create fairy tales, to do fantastic things. Maybe it’s a craving for love. Maybe I do what I do because I need people to approve of me: ‘You’re OK Claus, what you’re doing is fine, we love you.’”|||Six recipes from Claus Meyer’s Nordic Kitchen Bruschetta with squash puree and goats’ cheese Serves 4|||day-old white bread 8 slices|||squash puree ½ quantity (see below)|||goats’ cheese 100g, thinly sliced from a log|||olive oil 2 tbsp|||rosemary 1 sprig, needles picked|||sea salt flakes and freshly ground pepper|||For the squash purée|||butternut squash 1|||butter 25g|||cider vinegar 50ml, plus extra if needed|||sea salt flakes and freshly ground pepper|||acacia honey 1 tbsp|||To make the squash puree, peel and halve the squash, then scrape out the seeds with a spoon.

The men on the ice,Denmark,"The men are the remaining applicants to Denmark's celebrated annual Sledge Patrol Sirius (Slaedepatruljen Sirius), a unique special forces dog sled unit charged with patrolling and policing the 8,699-mile coastline of Northeast Greenland National Park -- the world's largest and northernmost wilderness.|||MESTERSVIG, GREENLAND|||Twelve men toe the line just minutes before 7 p.m. The temperature is minus 20 C, the warmest it's been all day. There is still no wind -- a rare reprieve for late February high above the Arctic Circle. Egon, a young sled dog chained near the station's flight tower, sees the men, stands to stretch, and then begins to howl into the vast silence.|||The men are the remaining applicants to Denmark's celebrated annual Sledge Patrol Sirius (Slaedepatruljen Sirius), a unique special forces dog sled unit charged with|||patrolling and policing the 8,699-mile coastline of Northeast Greenland National Park -- the world's largest and northernmost wilderness. Of the 12, eight are applying to the sledge patrol, while the other four are candidates to become station specialists, highly trained officers who provide necessary operational and logistical support to the dog sled teams as well as other branches of the Danish military.|||The candidates on the line are all in their early 20s and have been in Mestersvig, one of three small Danish military stations in the park, for nearly a month. Their winter survival course is a required component of an eight-month training program called forskole, a term that directly translates as preschool but means a type of preparatory school in Danish. The forskole includes coursework in fields as varied as mechanics, first aid, shooting, firefighting, carpentry, cooking, and sewing.|||Tonight they begin their final challenge of the winter training: a grueling overnight, 100-kilometer trek across the snow and ice on cross-country skis for the Sirius patrol candidates. That's two and a half times the distance of the Boston Marathon -- in the dark and cold, at the end of the earth. Station specialist applicants only have to go half that distance. The march will take place on a 5-kilometer circular course that begins and ends at the station's flight tower. It will take up to 24 hours to complete. Candidates must complete the march to continue in the selection process, but it doesn't guarantee they'll make the cut.|||Greenland was a colony of Denmark until 1953, attained home rule status in 1979, and advanced autonomy in June 2009. But for the foreseeable future, the country's financial, national security, civil rights, and justice affairs sectors remain under Danish jurisdiction. This includes policing authority. As the Arctic country becomes a geopolitical hot spot of energy development and an increasingly popular tourist destination, additional demands are being placed on the men of Sirius, whose primary function is to maintain Danish sovereignty in the frozen, desolate expanses.|||But it is becoming less desolate by the day. Climbers and kayakers and adventurers are applying in greater numbers for travel permits to explore the region's pristine mountains and waters. With the late-spring melt, come more and more tourist-laden cruise ships navigating the iceberg-mined fjords. At the same time, the prominence of Greenland in global climate change and climate research has brought many more researchers and scientists to the area.|||While it's not yet exactly crowded at the top of the world, it's becoming busier.|||Greenland's economic development may improve as a result of all of these developments, but the increased traffic in Northeast Greenland National Park presents potential logistical and structural problems to the sledge patrol unit -- the sole policing authority in a region the size of France and Germany combined.|||In the event that a cruise ship were to graze an iceberg, what could Sirius do? What would happen if an unarmed climate researcher is mauled by a polar bear? No hospital or services exist for thousands of miles. And, although mining and oil exploration have long been financially and technologically impossible or unsustainable in the region, warming temperatures and developments in technology may open more efficient pathways to exploration and extraction in Northeast Greenland. If an environmental disaster were to occur, what could Denmark -- and, more specifically, the men of Sirius -- do to contain it?|||The men are not adequately supplied and their numbers too few to effectively meet challenges of such magnitude. Yet they continue to do what they've always done and what their role demands -- train and prepare for any eventuality.|||Earlier in the day, Rufus Gifford, the US ambassador to Denmark, and Army Major Michael Wise, a delegate from the US embassy in Copenhagen, met several of the current Sirius patrolmen and station specialists in Mestersvig. Both men were set to travel by dog sled and camp overnight on the frozen Kong Oscar Fjord with patrolmen Anders Kjaergaard, Sebastian Vestergaard, and their dog teams.|||Gifford, who had made five previous trips to other parts of the country, talked about the reasons for this trip at lunch. ""Part of my job is to maintain strength between two key NATO allies. I am regularly in a situation where I [ask] the Danish government to increase their defense spending or send their F-16s and/or special operations forces into a conflict zone,"" Gifford said. ""I want to have greater context. I want to see how Denmark invests its money, and I want to have a greater understanding and appreciation for their current capability. I have spent time with two other elite branches of the Danish military -- the Frogmen and the Jaeger Corps -- so I wanted to spend with the third and most unique branch."" Greenland has become increasingly central to the ambassador's work since the United States assumed the Arctic Council Chair in 2015.|||During the meal, Frederik Oxlund, leader of the forskole, explained that the 100-kilometer march is based on the greatest midpoint distance between outposts. In the event that a man should lose his partner, sledge, and dogs between two stations, he needs to know that he can survive by walking to the nearest one. ""If a man has made the march once,"" Oxlund said, ""he knows that he can do it again.""|||On patrol, Sirius men always work in teams, which is also how they train, except for the march. ""This is actually the only real test of the individual. This is a single man against nature."" Oxlund smiled, and added, ""It's a great test for the students, a tough walk.""|||Thomas ""Hansi"" Hansen, chief instructor of the winter training, strides before the men in formation, ticking off the list of rules: No talking with one another. The instructors and Dr. Peter Ric-Hansen, who will monitor the men during the march, may ask them questions, but trainees may answer only yes or no. They are given a radio and flare gun to signal for help, a weapon, and 200 grams of chocolate, their only food for the duration of the march. Oxlund checks the men's layers, their weapons, and headlamps. No one has questions.|||At the strike of 7 p.m. Johan (cadets are allowed to be identified in public only by their first names) skis off into the night. There is no fanfare and no talking -- even Egon has stopped howling. Every five minutes, another man begins his march. By 8 p.m., all 12 are coasting on the circular course around the station. An hour later, the mercury has fallen to minus 22 C.|||Each time a man returns to the start line, the instructors rush out for a quick check. Candidates are offered a cup of warm water or juice, while Ric-Hansen checks for signs of frostbite or what he calls that ""faraway"" look. ""We are at the limit here,"" he says. ""If I see someone out there sleeping or something, I can alert the instructors. I also watch their time. One guy whose previous lap times are 55 minutes, 56 minutes, 58 minutes, and then suddenly the next lap is an hour and 20 minutes, is this because he was taking a break or eating? Did he get off the track because he had to go the bathroom, or has he been standing still or sleeping? Did he fall? Out there, if you lie down for even 20 minutes . . . "" The doctor trails off and shakes his head.|||By 11 p.m. the temperature has fallen again, to minus 25 C, and the first tendrils of the northern lights flare high in the sky. The lights quickly grow stronger and deeper in color, until the bright recognizable neon green of the aurora borealis stretches over the peaks of the Stauning Alps in the west to the mountains of Traill O across the icy fjord where Gifford, Wise, and the sledge teams are camped. Beneath the dancing electrons colliding with the upper atmosphere, and far from the station, the solitary beams of the marchers' headlamps bob and glide across the snowy, darkened plain.|||It is still dark when the first station specialist, cadet Kasper, approaches the finish line on his last lap around 5 a.m. The instructors, support staff, and doctor are almost giddy. They jump into motion and stretch a pennant banner of paper flags across the finish line. An instructor, Jesper Hoffman, stands facing the oncoming candidate. Behind his back, Hoffman holds a full-sized cloth Dannebrog, Denmark's red flag with the white Scandinavian cross. As Kasper skis by, Hoffman turns and drapes the flag over the skier's shoulders. The cadet smiles and crosses the finish line. The men break into applause.|||Kasper is tired, sore, and cold. He is quickly helped out of his skis and led into a room at the base of the tower where Oxlund and Hansen assist him in removing his boots and the many layers of clothing. Between the outer and mid-layers of clothing, ice has formed from his body's perspiration. When Oxlund removes the man's boots there are blisters but no frostbite.|||Over the next several hours, more men cross the finish line until all the station specialist applicants complete their 50-kilometer march. Each man is similarly celebrated and accompanied into the station tower. Ric-Hansen checks each candidate, and then they're told to go eat and drink.|||In the canteen, cadet Mads, who began his march at 7:45 p.m. and finished at 5:25 a.m., remembers looking up during the night and seeing the northern lights. ""I thought to myself, I'm walking around Northeast Greenland, where few people come,"" he says. ""I realized it was extraordinary. Who gets to do that? I felt kind of lucky."" He yawns. ""But I don't want to do it again tomorrow. Maybe another day.""|||At 10 a.m., Ambassador Gifford and Sledge Team 7 return from their night on the sea ice, where the overnight low had reached minus 32 C. Gifford's beard and eyelashes are caked in frost -- and he's exhausted. ""I would fall asleep for 10 minutes and then wake because my feet were so cold. At times, I would stick my nose out of the sleeping bag, just to get a bit of fresh air. But with one exhale, I could feel the moisture on my beard freeze. After tossing and turning and shivering for nine hours, I probably got a grand total of an hour of interrupted sleep,"" he says.|||Gifford has seen his fair share of fancy new military facilities during his time in the diplomatic services -- often to review the next generation gadgetry. ""There's simply none of that here,"" he says. ""This is one of the most elite military units on earth. Twelve soldiers, their sledge, and their dogs. These guys are all solider and all human, driven by superb commitment.""|||At the finish line, another young Sirius patrol candidate who has been cross-country skiing for 15 hours closes in on another lap. A 4-inch icicle hangs from his bearded chin. It is glazed red by juice given to him throughout the night by Oxlund and Hansen. He has 70 kilometers down and 30 more to go.|||Denver David Robinson is a writer and photographer based in Portland, Ore."

Greenland's Pipe Dream: Independence Through Uranium Mining,Denmark,"Ilulissat in Greenland[http://sputniknews.com/images/104048/31/1040483182.jpg]|||Uranium mining became the hottest topic in the cold, Arctic country, as Denmark's ‘zero tolerance' policy on mining radioactive substances came to an abrupt end. In Greenland, may local powers see a Greenlandic mineral and oil venture as a more than welcome boost to the country's sluggish economy, which is heavily dependent on fisheries and tourism. Many regard uranium as a vehicle to secure independence for the minuscule Arctic nation of 57,000 citizens, which at present is deeply dependent on Danish subsidies.|||However, many locals believe the Danish government has gone too far, citing environmental concerns; many share a growing concern for the fragile Arctic environment. Despite the Greenlandic political opposition insisting on a referendum on the uranium issue, the ruling majority deflects their demands under the pretext of the great potential for jobs and economic development.|||""Next week, demonstrations will be held simultaneously in eight cities in Greenland to show the government how many of us do not welcome uranium here,"" activist Falke Thue Mikailsen told Swedish Radio[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/gruppsida.aspx?programid=3304&grupp;=16679] last week.|||Earlier, the Danish government strictly opposed both oil drilling and uranium extraction for environmental reasons, as this could endanger the Arctic's pristine ecological system. Recently, however, Denmark made a U-turn, saying it would not block Greenland's wishes if it decides to take care of its natural resources.|||Earlier, Mads Flarup Christensen of Greenpeace Nordic pointed out some inconsistencies in Denmark's nuclear policy. According to him, Denmark pitched in lot of money to get reactors in Eastern Europe closed (together with the Swedish nuclear power plant Barsebäck in close proximity to the capital city of Copenhagen), yet endorsed the extraction of uranium in Greenland.|||Greenland, a former Danish colony, was granted home rule in 1979, and in 2008, Greenlanders voted in favor of the Self-Government Act, which vested even more power in the local Greenlandic government, yet left the Danish government in charge of foreign affairs, financial and security policies, as well as mineral resources. For many Greenlanders, total independence from Denmark is a long-term dream, achievable only through a diversification of the island's lopsided economy.|||At present, Greenland's economy remains deeply dependent on a frozen subsidy of 3.4 billion kroner (roughly 500 million dollars) per year. Also, Greenland, the world's largest island, remains one of the most sparsely populated nations, troubled by alcoholism, domestic violence and an exceptionally high suicide rate. Moreover, the probable mining projects in Greenland are hampered by an almost non-existent infrastructure and a harsh climate.|||Nuuk, #Greenland[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greenland?src=hash] — the #Monaco[https://twitter.com/hashtag/Monaco?src=hash] of the north. pic.twitter.com/G9IzCnEmL1[https://t.co/G9IzCnEmL1]— Nigel Short (@nigelshortchess) May 26, 2016[https://twitter.com/nigelshortchess/status/735913605808328704]​"

Designer dens: Danish island shelters perfect for outdoor breaks,Denmark,"A new network of architect-designed shelters from £3 a night is the perfect springboard for an idyllic kayaking, cycling and walking trip around the islands of Denmark’s South Funen archipelago|||Paddling along the densely wooded coastline, the view ahead was suddenly broken by asymmetrical shapes rising up from a grassy headland. Excited, we beached our kayaks on a thin strip of sand and went to investigate.|||A few metres from the sea we found two wooden trapezium-shaped shelters, raised off the ground on stilts. Chest-high at the front, clad in black tiles, the structure had a number of openings and artfully arranged portholes. This was home for the night.|||Along with my guide, Jakob, I was on the Danish island of Tåsinge, part of the South Funen archipelago that lies just south of Fyn, the large island sandwiched between the Jutland peninsula and Zealand (which hosts Copenhagen). It’s an undulating and green landscape, full of secluded beaches, nature reserves and historic towns.|||This was the first stage of a trip I was making through the region, travelling by kayak, bike and on foot. Bed each night would be in some of the 50 recently built architect-designed shelters of various sizes at 19 locations throughout the area.|||My journey began at the gatehouse to Tåsinge’s Valdemars Slot[http://valdemarsslot.dk/castle/?lang=en], a 17th-century castle by the sea, where Jacob and Pernille Nilsson run their kayak business, KajakInn[http://www.kajakinn.dk/].|||Pulling out a map, Jacob explained that we were going to kayak for a few kilometres across Lunkebugten – “a tricky-bay” – before rounding a headland and following the coast to a remote spot on the eastern edge of the island where there were two shelters[http://bookenshelter.dk/shelterplads/hegnet-taasinge/].|||After struggling into a dry suit, I grabbed a handful of waterproof gear bags and headed down to the beach. As he stuffed food and camping gear into the kayaks, Jacob said that South Fyn was perfect for nautical exploration as the water around the coasts was very shallow with lots of bays and inlets. This makes it popular with families and serious kayakers alike. Kayaks can be hired in the nearby town of Svendborg, while KajakInn also offers short training courses as well as guiding services.|||The shelters were built as part of a tourism project to encourage more outdoor enthusiasts travelling under their own steam to visit the Fyn area. Basic constructions with one side open to the elements can be found throughout the archipelago, but in 2015, new, all-enclosed designs were commissioned, ensuring year-round use (at a basic cost of £3 a night).|||Five models were created by the Danish firm Lumo Arkitekter[http://www.lumo.dk/index.php?id=7], ranging from the basic two-person Flounder, to the Monkfish that sleeps seven, has three floors and comes with a bird-watching platform at the top. The shapes are based on the huts used by local fishermen to store their catch although my Flounder reminded me most of a campervan pop-up roof bed.|||All shelter locations include a fire-pit, with a toilet and water supply nearby. However, you must bring bedding and cooking equipment, as well as food.|||Thankfully Jacob had filled the filled the kayak with more than enough provisions. That night, as we sat around the fire, feasting on chicken and dill casserole washed down with Bryg brown ale, and with the sea only metres away, I felt the Danish concept of hygge – roughly meaning cosy or content. Retiring to my shelter I realised it was more than just a timber tent; there was a feeling of solidity, a comforting tar smell, and I lay transfixed as the late evening light coming through the small portholes at different angles illuminated the cool minimalist design.|||I slept well, with the shelter warm but well ventilated, although some have grumbled about feeling claustrophobic and the bare wood amplifying every movement and sound. This was soon forgotten as we made a near-perfect kayak journey back to the castle. As the sun burned off the mist to reveal the surrounding islands, our slim wooden Greenland paddles slipped silently into the near-still waters.|||After leaving Tåsinge, I caught a ferry to Drejø, a small island 5km long and with permanent population of around 75. From the harbour, a track atop a dyke followed the island’s southern coast. Land here has been drained for centuries creating lush, flat fields, although in places pumping has ceased so as to create lakes and nature reserves.|||My dyke walk was short, but a perfect taster for hikers who want to take on the South Fyn archipelago trail[http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/archipelago-trail-gdk993753], a 200km network of signposted paths that circumnavigates the area.|||Drejø’s three shelters[http://bookenshelter.dk/shelterplads/drejoe-syd/] were right next to the island’s best swimming spot – clear seas with a bathing jetty leading from the beach into deeper water. After a cooling dip, I met Jonas Jespersen, who manages the site, preparing wood for a new communal area. As he painted, using the shelters’ trademark black-pigmented wood tar oil, he told me: “We get walkers, kayakers, anglers. Last year was a terrible summer and we still had over 300 people staying. If we’re full, they just camp.”|||Jonas pointed me in the direction of Gammel Havn, the old harbour. On the way I passed through the island’s village with its timber-framed houses and museum[http://www.xn--sfartshistorie-qqb.dk/museer/mus353.html], not to mention a cafe selling the local skarø[http://www.isfraskaroe.dk/EN/Retailers/DairyIce-cream/] “birch juice” ice cream before heading back to my shelter.|||An early start the next day saw me catching a ferry to Ærø, the third largest island in the archipelago. With the sky a deep blue, it felt more like Greek island-hopping than a Baltic boat trip and by the time we docked in the 17th-century market town of Ærøskøbing, I felt I had adjusted to South Fyn’s slower pace of life.|||Here I met local cycle guide and writer, Allan Harsbo, who owns hire firm Bike Erria[http://www.bike-erria.dk/eng/eng_om_os.html]. While having a coffee in the beautifully preserved, almost Disney-like, cobbled market square, he noticed me staring at a bright pink Trabant car parked up next to us. “Ah yes,” he said, “Ærø is the Las Vegas of Denmark”. The island’s bureaucracy-free marriage laws mean that many non-Danes flock to the island to get hitched.|||I was keen to start exploring so we picked up a couple of bikes and began meandering our way on dedicated cycle tracks and empty roads across the eastern part of the island. As we pedalled past quiet bays and fields full of solar panels and grazing sheep, Allan would light his pipe and exclaim: “Just listen to the silence.”|||Eventually we arrived at the seafaring town of Marstal, its long maritime history displayed in fascinating detail at the local museum. More strenuous cycle routes head up to the tiny hills in the centre of the island, while others include the moated manor of Søbygaard[http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/sobygaard-aeroe-gdk612140], and breweries.|||The final shelter I visited in this unique area was located beneath a small cliff on a beach.

"Will Saudi Arabia Open Itself Up for Tourism? An ultraconservative kingdom wary of outside influences is trying to attract more foreign visitors, including non-Muslims",Denmark,"Desert ""glamping,"" pristine diving spots and some of the best archaeological sites you've never heard of all await visitors to Saudi Arabia. There is just one catch: The ultraconservative kingdom doesn't issue tourist visas.|||But that now looks set to change.|||Saudi Arabia's vast oil wealth has allowed the ruling monarchy to keep the country and its economy largely insulated from outside influences while imposing an austere version of Islam. But a sharp drop in crude prices over the past two years is pressuring the Saudi royals to open both the economy and the country's vastly underdeveloped tourism industry to the wider world.|||""It is the last frontier of tourism,"" said Brid Beeler, a Washington-based tourism consultant who organizes and leads rare customized tours of Saudi Arabia. ""There are no places in the world like it, that are so unknown.""|||Fearful of Western cultural mores, the kingdom has always been off limits to foreign holidaymakers. But Prince Sultan bin Salman, the head of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage, said that he is pushing to make it easier for both Muslim and non-Muslim tourists to visit the secluded Gulf state.|||""We are depriving ourselves of the opportunity to show people what our country is about,"" the prince said.|||The most common visitors are pilgrims: Every year, some 18 million Muslims from around the globe travel to Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Until recently, visa rules restricted them to those two cities and to nearby Jeddah, because of Saudi worries about security and illegal migration. But a program launched in April by the tourism commission encourages pilgrims to visit sites elsewhere in the kingdom by allowing them to convert their visas into tourist visas. (Citizens of neighboring Gulf Arab states can already travel to Saudi Arabia visa-free under the terms of a regional alliance.)|||Prince Sultan said that he has also submitted a proposal to start issuing tourist visas to non-Muslims—with a format similar to an earlier experiment when Saudi Arabia allowed in tour groups from the U.S., Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, the U.K., Denmark and Japan.|||Still, Mecca and Medina remain strictly off-limits to non-Muslims. And despite quietly warming Saudi ties with Israel over their shared hatred of Iran, Israeli citizens are still banned from entering Saudi Arabia.|||Even with its more welcoming attitude, Saudi Arabia is unlikely to be swarmed by tourists. Security concerns may deter many potential visitors. In a travel warning[https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/saudi-arabia-travel-warning.html] updated in April, the State Department ""urges U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks of traveling to Saudi Arabia"" and ""keep a low profile"" if they do go. Sunni radicals, including Islamic State and al Qaeda, have long seen the ruling monarchy as heretics. The country has suffered a recent spate of terrorist attacks, including a startling suicide bombing that killed four security guards next to the mosque in Medina where the Prophet Muhammad is said to be buried.|||Compounding these jitters, Saudi Arabia, one of the Arab world's Sunni heavyweights, has also been engulfed in an increasingly bitter sectarian power struggle with Shiite Iran—including proxy battles now raging in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere.|||Other potential tourists may have been put off by Saudi Arabia's severe restrictions on personal freedoms. Based on its stringent interpretation of Islam, the Saudi government enforces segregation by gender and imposes a conservative dress code on women, among other strictures. Bikinis and booze remain forbidden.|||But Iran's theocratic rulers insist on a similar set of mores, and that hasn't stopped tourism from flourishing there. And proponents of increased tourism to Saudi Arabia say that the mystery of the closed-off kingdom is among its biggest draws.|||In the coastal Saudi city of Jeddah, a movement to revitalize the historic quarter hopes that tourists will follow. With government encouragement, local residents are beginning to restore buildings that were largely abandoned following the oil boom of the 1970s. In 2014, the area made Unesco's list of World Heritage sites[http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/sa].|||""I want to turn my house into a boutique hotel—that's my investment plan,"" said Samir Matboly, a homeowner sitting in the foyer of his newly restored family home in Jeddah. Outside, the neighborhood's first souvenir shops have opened in recent months, selling mugs, keychains and small replicas of the old town's traditional homes.|||For Ahmad Angawi, a Jeddah-based artist, the restoration of the old city is much more than a commercial opportunity.|||""It's becoming a search for identity,"" said Mr. Angawi, who is working to revive the city's traditional crafts, such as geometric woodcarving.|||Such sentiments are relatively new in Saudi Arabia. When Prince Sultan was first offered a job at the tourism commission in 2000, he said, his heart sank. ""It was the last thing I wanted. Tourism in Saudi Arabia? I knew it was complicated,"" recalled the prince, a former astronaut who flew on a 1985 U.S. space shuttle flight.[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/al-saud.html]|||But during the reign of King Salman, who took power last year, economic imperatives have pressured the closed kingdom to tolerate more interaction with the 21st-century world beyond its borders, even at the risk of eroding tight controls on social mores.|||As such, tourism has become an important part of an ambitious government plan for economic change[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/saudi-arabia-approves-economic-reform-program-1461588979] known as Saudi Vision 2030, which is aimed at reducing Saudi Arabia's historic dependence on oil. Oil revenues make up about 39% of Saudi gross domestic product; tourism accounts for less than 3%.|||Saudi Arabia has experimented with tourism before. For a few years, in partnership with the national carrier, Saudi Airlines, tour operators from the U.S., Japan and several European countries organized trips for small groups of foreign visitors. That program ended in 2014. The government said that it needed to focus on developing domestic tourism before opening the country to outside visitors.|||Still, Saudi Arabia boasts several promising tourist draws, such as prehistoric rock art in the region of Hail and the ruins of the first-century Nabatean settlement of Madain Saleh[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1293]—Saudi Arabia's own version of Jordan's famed Petra. But limited transportation and hotel accommodation means visitors are likely to have a tough time making the trip.|||Saudi authorities say that one of their top priorities is attracting private investment to develop the infrastructure needed to support an influx of visitors. Officials also want to open new museums and promote neglected heritage sites.|||Another major focus in a country with an 11% unemployment rate and a population that is mostly under 30: persuading deep-pocketed Saudis themselves to vacation in the kingdom and thus to create much-needed jobs.|||Ahmed Al Omran contributed to this article.|||Related Reading|||* Saudi Arabian Women Love Bumper Cars (But Not for Bumping)[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/saudi-arabian-women-love-bumper-cars-but-not-for-bumping-1466445023] (June 20, 2016)|||* Oil Change: Affluent Saudi Arabia Goes to Work[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/oil-change-affluent-saudi-arabia-goes-to-work-1464716895] (May 31, 2016)|||* Saudi Changes Meet Resistance From Traditional Clerics[http://www.wsj.com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/articles/saudi-changes-meet-resistance-from-traditional-clerics-1462833094] (May 9, 2016)"
Arctic nations square up as clamour for resources grows,Denmark,"With the Danes rebuffing Russia, and Canada laying further claim to the Northwest Passage, rising access to north pole reserves risks flashpoints|||Kristian Jensen, Denmark’s foreign minister, gave a precise response last week to a request by Russia for the nations to enter bilateral talks over the ownership of the north pole. He flatly rejected the move. “We need to apply the international rules,” he told reporters.|||The Russian request and the swift Danish response are intriguing. The United Nations is currently assessing Russian, Danish and Canadian claims to own sizeable chunks of the Arctic seabed. The Russian move was generally viewed as an attempt to strike a deal that would cut out Canada, while Denmark appears to believe its case is strong enough to exclude such manoeuvres.|||One thing is clear. The Arctic is heating up in meteorological, political and environmental terms as nations fall over themselves to exploit the region.|||Apart from Denmark’s rebuff of Russia’s Arctic overtures, Canadian explorers announced last week they had discovered the wreck of HMS Terror[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt], one of the two ships belonging to British explorer Sir John Franklin’s doomed attempt to sail the Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific. (The other expedition ship, Erebus, was discovered two years ago.) These two vessels have enormous symbolic importance because Canada believes they support its claim to own the passage, which other nations, such as the US, argue is international waters.|||Then there were the recent moves by China to invest in mines in Greenland[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt], where declining ice cover is exposing vast outcrops of ores, including minerals crucial to mobile phone manufacture. Similarly, drilling companies are eyeing seabed reserves of natural gas and oil while travel companies are preparing to send huge cruise liners into the region. The first of these trips, by the Crystal Serenity[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/13/large-cruise-ship-voyage-arctic-ice-crystal-cruises], has just been completed.|||Enormous forces, political and commercial, are bearing down on the region although all have a common root – as was also highlighted last week. Summer sea ice, which once covered 7.5 million sq km around the north pole, this year dropped to 4.13m sq km, its second lowest figure on record, it was announced.[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/16/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-second-lowest-level-ever-recorded] The rate of annual change – brought about by soaring fossil fuel emissions and rises in global temperatures – is now equivalent to a loss greater than the size of Scotland.|||“Loss of sea ice has local to global effects, from animals and ecosystems to encouraging further warming by exposing ocean water,” said Twila Moon, at Bristol University. “We should all be shocked by the dramatic changes happening in the Arctic.”|||Most scientists now expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of the century. By “free” they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by “reliably”, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however.|||“The Arctic is opening up, and all sorts of flashpoints lie ahead,” said Klaus Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of London. “If the central Arctic Ocean is freed of ice for several months a year, who will control the fishing and the dumping of waste there? The Russians have also made it clear they want to drill for oil and gas.”|||This point was also stressed by Professor Chris Rapley, of University College London. “An increasingly ice-free Arctic is a geopolitical game changer,” he said.|||Already there are profound changes, with invasive species pouring into the warming Arctic and threatening existing populations, according to Melanie Lancaster of WWF’s Arctic programme. “Specialised Arctic species such as polar bears [are already] showing signs of stress. Conservation action is urgently needed.”|||However, the Arctic, its wildlife and its four million inhabitants face a major handicap: the region’s lack of centralised protection and control. The Antarctic Treaty bans all mining, oil drilling or the presence of the military and strictly monitors all environmental hazards around the south pole. By contrast, although no nation owns the north pole, the Arctic nations – Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Denmark – have very different ideas about how to run the world’s most northerly regions.|||“Arctic environmental protection is currently determined by individual nations, by politicians who often meet far from its borders: in Moscow, Copenhagen and Washington,” said Professor Michael Byers of the University of British Columbia. “They have very different levels of commitment to protecting the environment – with Russia at the bottom and the Nordic nations at the top.”|||And it is not just the Arctic nations who are eyeing up the riches around the north pole. China recently assigned itself the status of being “a near-Arctic state”. It views the opening Arctic seas as an opportunity to maintain its access to the world’s most important resources. Some of the Earth’s major stocks of fish are migrating north as the planet heats up while the Arctic’s mineral resources are being exposed by retreating ice.|||“The Chinese have made no secret that they have their eyes on the Arctic’s fish and minerals,” said Dodds.|||This raises the question of what the Inuit and other Arctic people think about resources being exploited by others. “They are not against resource development but they do like to be consulted and involved,” said Dodds. “They do not want to be cheated. However, there are often disagreements within communities about the choices they have to make. Will a mining development ruin a village’s tourist potential, for example?”|||Byers was cautious. “I have enormous sympathy for the local peoples in the Arctic but they are few in number and have limited resources. They are trying to insert themselves into the decision-making of some of the most powerful companies and countries in the world,” he said.|||Relations with indigenous people are one of the flashpoints that may trigger serious disputes in the region. There is already bitterness among the Inuit about their treatment in the past and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada is currently investigating the serious abuse that thousands of children received[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/06/canada-dark-of-history-residential-schools] in residential schools last century. That resentment could colour future attempts to develop the region.|||Of all the Arctic nations, Russia has been the most determined to exploit the region as it warms, however. “You can see that determination in the way it responded to the Arctic 30 incident,” said Duncan Depledge, Director, All-Party Parliamentary Group for Polar Regions Secretariat. In 2013, Greenpeace activists attempted to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform as part of a protest against Arctic oil production. Russians arrested them at gunpoint[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/19/greenpeace-protesters-arrested-arctic] and charged the activists initially with piracy and later with hooliganism and only released them after two months of detention. “That is an indication of how seriously they take the Arctic,” added Depledge.|||This point was backed by Dodds: “The Russians are hell bent on showing the world they mean business here.”|||Could that determination lead to an outbreak of hostilities? Byers was not convinced. “The Arctic is a very expensive region in which to operate and Russia is not a wealthy country. The cost of militarising the Arctic would be prohibitive. They might want to police it so that they can control outfits like Greenpeace but I don’t see them having a war with another Arctic nation.”|||The implications for the region are still worrying, nevertheless. As Rapley stated: “The ongoing thinning [of Arctic summer sea ice] is especially significant and the implications are profound. The Arctic nations are jostling for advantage, and the economic and ecological consequences of new trade routes opening up have yet to unfold. The changes that have occurred have been greater and faster than predicted. The planet is sending a clear message: time is running out.”"
Sofus Poulsen,Denmark,"Diplomat|||Born: July 12, 1929;|||Died: August 19, 2016|||SOFUS Poulsen, who has died aged 86, was a Danish diplomat who for many years served as the Faroe Islands’ representative in the UK. He was appointed an assistant in Faroe’s diplomatic office in Aberdeen in 1948 and served there as the commercial attache from 1980 to 2002.|||Faroe is a mountainous archipelago of 18 inhabited islands under the Danish Crown but it has had home rule since 1948. It lies in the North Atlantic, just over 200 miles north-west of the Scottish mainland, with a population that passed 50,000 for the first time in 2015.|||For many years Mr Poulsen was the highest-ranked foreign diplomat based in Scotland at Faroe’s office in Market Street, Aberdeen. He was replaced after his retirement by a Faroese diplomat based at the Royal Danish Embassy in London.|||Mr Poulsen was born in the tiny Eysturoy hamlet of Soldarfjord, one of a line of small settlements on the shores of Skala Fjord, Faroe’s longest sea inlet on the coast of its East Island. His father Oil Poulsen was among 38 fishermen who were killed in 1932 when two Faroese fishing smacks (locally known as sloops) were lost in a hurricane.|||Mr Poulsen arrived in Aberdeen in 1946 after a 50-hour trip on a fishing boat to represent a Faroese fishing company. The Second World War had reshaped the economy of the islands, which had relied on salted, dried, cod being exported directly to Mediterranean countries, which was impossible from 1940 onwards when Denmark was occupied by the Nazis.|||Only the British market remained and it demanded fresh produce. About one fish in five landed in the UK from 1940-45 came from Faroe ships, often carrying iced cargoes from Iceland. Britain had garrisoned Faroe as a protectorate for the duration of the war, a move welcomed by most islanders.|||Mr Poulsen settled into life Aberdeen immediately, meeting his wife-to-be at a Youth for Christ gathering in the city in 1949; the couple were engaged on the third anniversary of their meeting and married exactly two years later in 1954.|||Later he was active in resolving a dispute between the UK and Faroe over fishing limits and territorial limits. Faroe had a long friendly relationship with the UK but, in 1961, the Aberdeen trawler Red Crusader was fired on by a Danish frigate after she was apprehended for allegedly poaching in waters that the Danes said were forbidden to British ships at certain seasons between six and 12 miles off Faroe.|||In May 1999, the UN was asked to ratify an end to the long-standing dispute which delineated the Continental Shelf boundary between the UK and Faroe. This was internationally important as major oil and gas fields lie under the seabed off Britain’s zone to the West of Shetland.|||During his long career, Mr Poulsen met and helped an astonishing variety of people and was renowned for the courtesy he showed to all. For 17 years he was a well-kent face in the far north of Scotland when Scrabster had a weekly summer passenger ferry service to Faroe and Iceland.|||In 1990, the ferry Smyril was the main transport for British Week when ex-soldiers, pipers and a Royal Marines band travelled north to mark the 50th anniversary of the “friendly occupation” of Faroe by the British.|||It gave mountainous Faroe its only airport, which these days is its main entry point for all international business and some tourist visitors; its Atlantic Airways runs year-round scheduled services from Edinburgh, while Royal Engineers also built some new roads, although they were nothing to the subsequent causeways, bridges, through-mountain and sub-sea tunnels that link all of Faroe’s main islands.|||During the anniversary celebrations, it seemed as if the whole of Faroe lined Torshavn’s harbour, while Mr Poulsen arranged for the Royal Marines band to assemble on the ship’s car-deck.|||When the first ramp was lowered, the Royal Marines band marched ashore, with Mr Poulsen waving away a lone immigration officer who had been demanding to see passports.|||The Faroe Islands enjoy one of the highest standards of living in the world, with 20,000 more people living there than when Mr Poulsen arrived in Aberdeen. Faroe voted not to join the European Economic Community along with Denmark, Ireland and the UK in 1973 and remains outside the European Union.|||On June 7 1999, Mr Poulsen was knighted by Denmark’s Queen Margrethe at Edinburgh Castle for his lengthy, meritorious service. He is survived by his wife Nessie and their family of four grown-up sons, Danny, Charles, Roy and John, grand-children and great-grandchildren.|||BILL MOWAT"
Art Deco Los Angeles,Denmark,"CORRECTION APPENDEDCalifornia's broad landscape suggests endless possibility, a chance to realize your dreams. You can backpack in the Klamath National Forest within Siskiyou County. You can find a slice of Denmark in the Santa Ynez Valley. Or you can immerse yourself in the glittery landscape of the Hollywood hills, the place that has applied a practicality to its dreams by making an industry of them.|||You tend to forget about reveries, though, when the 101 freeway slows to a crawl, as it did when I began to navigate the road in Hollywood this spring. Time on my hands, I looked up and caught a glimpse of the 73-story U.S. Bank Tower, referred to as Library Tower by many locals for the 90-year-old actual library and architectural gem across the street that it dwarfs.|||Completed in the late 1980s, the iconic Bank Tower is one of those structures that sneak up in vistas to remind you that yes, you're in Los Angeles, in case you were wondering. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi for 27 years, until the Wilshire Grand Center's spire was added this year. Designed by the architect Henry N. Cobb, the building is topped with a distinctive crown that hints at downtown's Art Deco past. Despite its size, it is not exactly the first building that comes to mind when people think of Los Angeles.|||Some cities have a single architectural identity but Los Angeles is known for many. It was an incubator of the American Craftsman style, and it embraced Beaux-Arts, as well as Spanish Colonial Revival and Mayan Revival, which found a powerful advocate in Frank Lloyd Wright. But then Art Deco arrived and proliferated during the decades when movie studios became the cornerstone of an economy that had previously relied primarily on oil. It left a stunning cache of public buildings in its wake.|||Several of them have been razed, and a few of the surviving ones are underused or vacant. Tourists gravitate toward the Bank Tower, which has an observation deck, or Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall. But before being literally overshadowed, these Art Deco treasures were once icons of downtown Los Angeles. And they still should be.|||Most of the Art Deco buildings are smaller than the modern skyscrapers rising in the area, but they still soar. To explore them is to witness a grandeur that inspires you, unlike many skyscrapers, which merely surprise you. Because they arrived at a moment of economic expansion, they suggest the sense of endless possibility that permeated the city. I set off to get a glimpse of what those architectural dreamers were able to accomplish.|||On an otherwise mild morning, I found myself holding an umbrella in Pershing Square, a public park. The rain quickly tapered off, sparing me the embarrassment of having chosen to visit California on a weekend when the weather was worse than it was in New York.|||Pershing Square, originally known as La Plaza Abaja and dedicated in 1866, is one of the oldest parks in the city. Taking up an entire city block and almost centrally located downtown, the park is a perfect starting point for exploring Art Deco in Los Angeles.|||In the early 1920s, Los Angeles was in an enviable position. There was a burgeoning retail market downtown, with stores including A. Hamburger & Sons, Bullock's and the J. W. Robinson Company strengthening their economic footholds. Automobiles brought so many people here that multiple parking garages were constructed to alleviate the constant traffic backups. The robust Pacific Electric Railway system connected downtown to nearby cities like Pasadena and Whittier, as well as more far-flung places such as Colton and Redlands in San Bernardino County. These developments made the area all the more attractive for architectural innovation.|||The Paris Exhibition of 1925, officially L'Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, was held from April to October of that year and was instrumental in promoting Art Deco as a design style that stressed modernity and progress. The industrial arts exhibit influenced a wave of architects to deviate from the formal Beaux-Arts style popular at the time to a style that was punctuated by features like colorful terra cotta, stucco, decorative crowns, zigzags and flat roofs with parapets. For years, this style was loosely called Art Moderne. However, it would become known as Art Deco, a term fashioned by the British art critic Bevis Hillier in 1968.|||From the late 1920s until the early 1940s, Art Deco was at the height of its popularity in the city. The design style included Zigzag Moderne -- characterized by classic zigzag patterns and setbacks, where buildings featured a wide base, becoming narrower as they rose in height. It also included Streamline Moderne, a subdued style that emphasized horizontal design elements and often had flat roofs and curves.|||As I walked to the northeast edge of Pershing Square, one the finest examples of Art Deco architecture in the city came into view.|||The Title Guarantee and Trust Company Building, at Hill and West Fifth Streets, a beautiful cream-colored glazed terra cotta structure with a granite base, has a way of drawing your attention. Built in 1930, the building still radiates an architectural regalness. At 12 stories, it has a Gothic-style tower that recedes from the larger structure and features stylized buttresses. The recessed tower design is a flourish that allowed the building to exceed the established 150-foot height limit, dramatically rising to 240 feet.|||It soared, just not excessively. Citywide height ordinances, in place from 1905 until 1957, were enacted to prevent Los Angeles from becoming a carbon copy of skyscraper-laden cities like New York and Chicago.|||''People in early 20th-century Los Angeles were interested in the design of the city,'' said Paul Gleye, author of ''The Architecture of Los Angeles'' and a professor of architecture at North Dakota State University. ''San Francisco was still the pre-eminent city in California, but there was a great civic pride in Los Angeles.''|||As I looked up from the base of the Title Guarantee Building, I took in the bas-relief sculptures depicting two kneeling men and a central figure that adorned the exterior. John B. Parkinson and Donald Parkinson, the influential father-son team of architects who designed this building and several others, commissioned the artist Eugene Maier-Krieg to design the sculptures. Hugo Ballin, a noted American muralist, designed six panels in the lobby that chronicle the history of the city.|||I admired the zigzag motif that formed part of the design above the main entrance on West Fifth Street. Because the building is now private, only residents and their guests can enjoy its full glory. Still, the facade alone was engrossing, so it was hard to leave.|||The Bunker Hill neighborhood, which offers some of the most commanding views of the surrounding area, is just a few paces from the Title Guarantee Building. There, the extent of Art Deco craftsmanship in downtown Los Angeles was on full display.|||One Bunker Hill, built as the headquarters for Southern California Edison, the electric supply behemoth, rests on a steep slope. When completed in 1931, it was one of the first buildings with an all-electric heat and cooling system in the Western United States. An illuminated ''Edison'' sign at the top of the building solidified the region as an emerging economic power.|||One Bunker Hill is now almost surrounded by the U.S. Bank Tower and the 26-story 400 South Hope building, two 1980s-era skyscrapers. It now looks diminutive by comparison, many say. But I was drawn to it, rather than to its tall bookends.|||The granite and limestone building was designed in a setback style, with architectural offsets on two lower floors, along with two of the upper floors. The central tower at the top of the building is fronted with terra cotta. The corner entrance, featuring a stately octagonal rotunda, has three bas-relief figures on the exterior. The figures, created by the sculptor Robert Merrell Gage, depict power, light and hydroelectricity.|||One Bunker Hill was envisioned as a monument to energy. The two-story lobby only reaffirmed the intent of architectural grandeur. Natural light poured into the multicolored room, highlighting its indelible features: over a dozen types of marble; gold-leaf ornamentation on the ceiling; and murals by the artists Barse Miller, Conrad Buff and, once again, Hugo Ballin.|||Mr. Ballin's mural, ''The Apotheosis of Power,'' features the English physicist William Gilbert, a pioneer in the research of magnetism and electrical attraction, and Benjamin Franklin.|||The building gives you a sense of what Los Angeles wanted to be, and what it has become, part of a huge megalopolis that still shows no signs of slowing down.|||When I saw the Los Angeles Central Library building from a distance, I first thought it was a temple. It had Byzantine, Egyptian, Spanish Colonial and Roman architectural influences and, at 90 years old, it truly exemplifies the grandeur of early Art Deco.|||Bertram Goodhue, designer of the Nebraska State Capitol, and Carleton Winslow Sr. were the architects of the Central Library. The building is topped with a mosaic pyramid-shaped tower. Limestone figures, including a bust of Leonardo da Vinci, are featured on the exterior. The interior of the main rotunda has prominently arched ceilings. The Central Library incorporated so many architectural styles, in addition to Art Deco, that it was almost an early precursor to what the city has become: one of the most culturally diverse places in the world.|||Beginning in the 1960s, the threat of demolition loomed over the Central Library. In 1978, the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit organization committed to the preservation of historic buildings in the city, was established largely because of opposition to the proposal. The bulldozers never came. This was an almost unheard-of civic victory in an era when downtowns were rapidly depopulating.|||As I walked into the rotunda, I noticed that people were enthralled with murals designed by the illustrator Dean Cornwell. Each mural depicts an aspect of the history of California, including the 1781 founding of El Pueblo de los Ángeles, the Spanish settlement that eventually grew to be modern Los Angeles. The murals prompted conversation, even among strangers. I overheard a man recall being taken to the library as a child, influencing him to do the same for his children.|||Not all of the buildings survived long enough to inspire memories of family legacies. The Richfield Oil Company Building, which was demolished between late 1968 and 1969, according to Mr. Gleye, ''was one of the most magnificent Art Deco structures anywhere.'' Richfield Tower was clad in glazed black architectural terra cotta and gold trimming, with the top of the building resembling an oil derrick. It was the epitome of Zigzag Moderne.|||But it wasn't so appealing at the time of its demolition. ''In 1968, people looked back at Art Deco and thought it was ugly and too decorative,'' Mr. Gleye said. ''A generation has to pass before things are appreciated. After modernism became the leading style, there were very few defenders of Art Deco.''|||In place of Richfield Tower sprouted twin 52-story skyscrapers now known as City National Plaza. You can still get a hint of Richfield Tower from two tall zigzag elevator doors that were salvaged in the demolition and have been incorporated near a lobby entrance at the Plaza.|||The one Art Deco building allowed to exceed height restrictions was City Hall. The architectural team of John C. Austin, Albert C. Martin and John Parkinson created a tall central tower, built with concrete mixed with sand from each of California's 58 counties. It rises majestically. The building's upper floors feature symmetrical setbacks, with an eccentric ziggurat top.|||An open-air observatory on the 27th floor is free and accessible to the general public. From this perch, the city is devilishly inviting. If the visibility is good, you can see Santa Catalina Island. I was not as lucky. However, I did see Los Angeles Union Station, my next stop.|||Union Station, the largest passenger train station in the Western United States, was completed in 1939. Approached from North Alameda Street, the station's Art Deco, Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival architectural influences are immediately apparent.|||Marlyn Musicant, author of ''Los Angeles Union Station,'' said that the building's Art Deco elements ''come across so clearly, yet are subtle.''|||The white entrance signs have an aesthetically pleasing Streamline Moderne look. In the main waiting area, the vaulted steel-truss ceiling, which gives the appearance of simple wooden beams, radiates a collegiate feel. The red-tiled roof, interior courtyard spaces, arched windows and white stucco create a distinct Mission Revival look.|||''The architects wanted to go with a more modern influence,'' Ms. Musicant added, ''so instead of utilizing wrought-iron chandeliers, the designers went with bronze chandeliers.''|||Union Station was designed to serve as a combined rail terminus for the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railways. With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in Southern California, along with the advent of commercial air travel, rail ridership began to decline sharply in the mid-1950s. The station was becoming a place that, while still remarkable, was seemingly lost in another place and time.|||''By the 1960s, Union Station was neglected and had fallen into a sad state,'' Ms. Musicant said. ''At one point, there were only 15 trains going out of the station each day.''|||Beginning in the 1970s, increased Amtrak service gave Union Station some long-overdue energy. The building was restored in 1992, the same year that Metrolink, a regional rail service, began to operate in the station. Metro Rail, the rail system that serves Los Angeles County, has three lines with stops at the station.|||At some train stations, a cold bench would be a prize, but not in Union Station, which reveals the romanticism of rail travel. Its waiting room has upholstered wooden chairs on the main floor. The travertine walls, doors with Moorish accents, and colorful glazed floor tiles have alluring patterns. The long exterior walkways and outside tower evoke Spanish Missions, while the courtyard areas maintain an aura of tranquillity.|||As I headed back closer to Pershing Square, the Oviatt Building on South Olive Street came into view. The Art Deco building, named for the entrepreneur James Oviatt, incorporates Italian Romanesque elements, with tiled roofs, cornices, marble and a three-faced French-imported clock. With his business partner Frank Alexander, Mr. Oviatt opened the upscale Alexander & Oviatt haberdashery in 1912.|||Inspired by a 1925 visit to the Art Deco Exhibition in Paris, Mr. Oviatt commissioned his namesake 1928 building, which housed his store on the lower floors, along with an ornate penthouse apartment where he lived. The penthouse, which also played host to many luminaries during Hollywood's golden age, is now a popular venue for private events.|||When the building opened, it featured work from the French designer René Lalique and the glassmaker Gaëtan Jeannin. Much of their original work is gone but the entrance arcade still radiates an Art Deco feel. The arcade, with unique etched-glass panels, immediately caught my eye. Intricate mailbox and elevator doors made from maillechort, an alloy of copper, nickel, and zinc, were designed by Lalique.|||The footprints of the retail past of downtown Los Angeles are one of the more interesting characteristics of the neighborhood. The area around South Hill Street and South Broadway near Pershing Square boasted some of the busiest and most fashionable stores in the entire region in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s, urban decline and rapid population growth in the western edges of the city lured many customers away from downtown, but the buildings remained.|||The area's Art Deco legacy gave me a true sense of the walkable nature of downtown. In addition to residential and retail developments, there are various markets and restaurants that have sold ethnic food in the neighborhood for many years.|||Robert D. Herman, a retired professor of sociology at Pomona College, stressed the importance of the work of the urban studies activist Jane Jacobs and her belief that ''mixed-use'' developments maintain the vitality and viability of cities.|||''Uniformity and isolation will kill a neighborhood,'' Mr. Herman said. ''People in urban areas expect streets to be part of the urban environment.''|||The buildings, though, are what draw your eye. On South Hill Street, the Sun Realty, William Fox, and Harris & Frank buildings are all part of the city's jewelry district. The buildings opened between 1925 and 1932, and while many of the upper floors featured office space for various businesses, the lower floors all had well-trafficked jewelry stores. And just as I expected, the Art Deco elements were still there.|||Private lofts now occupy the blue-green Eastern Columbia Building, the 1930 classic designed by Claud Beelman. Formerly the headquarters of the Eastern Outfitting and Columbia Outfitting companies, which sold appliances and clothing, respectively, the building sets the tone for decorative architecture in the city. The entrance extended inward, with a terra cotta sunburst detail that evoked optimism. Topped by a clock tower that loomed over the immediate area, the gold-trimmed building staked its position as a center of commerce.|||There are many other hidden treasures downtown like the now-shuttered Roxie Theater, the only theater built in downtown Los Angeles solely in Art Deco style; the Title Insurance and Trust Building, now being converted into modern offices; and the beige terra cotta Ninth & Broadway Building, an anchor of the revitalized retail core. The Foreman & Clark Building, formerly the flagship location of the Foreman & Clark department store and recently acquired by a developer, and the Beelman-designed Garfield Building, now vacant, await new futures.|||As I walked on South Broadway, I noticed an Art Deco building that at one time housed a F & W Grand-Silver Stores retail location and a Hartfield's Department Store. Now being renovated, the handsome midblock six-story building in many ways represents the resurgence of downtown. Art Deco defined the heights that downtown Los Angeles sought to reach in its infancy as a major city. Generations later, those heights are being unveiled once again.|||If You Go|||Where to Eat|||Perch (448 South Hill Street; 213-802-1770; perchla.com) is a rooftop restaurant and bar serving French fare with stunning views of the upper floors of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company Building, as well as the surrounding downtown landscape. Recent main courses included gnocchi with pesto, crème fraîche and squash ($19), and pan-roasted salmon, with smoked eggplant purée, vegetables Provençal and artichoke chips ($27). For a unique drink, try the Hemingway on the Beach, a mix of gin, Luxardo, lemon juice and Angostura bitters ($12).|||Cicada Restaurant (617 South Olive Street; 213-488-9488; cicadarestaurant.com) is a refined Art Deco space inside the Oviatt Building, with dark wood paneling and zigzag motifs. Entree options recently included chicken breast with Marsala mustard sauce ($32) and wild black bass with roasted potatoes and a lemon virgin olive oil sauce ($40).|||Inside Union Station, Traxx (800 North Alameda Street; 213-625-1999; traxx.la) is an ornate restaurant and bar. Have a glass of Clos du Val Carneros pinot noir and take a break from all the bustle.|||Where to Stay|||The Ace Hotel Downtown Los Angeles (929 South Broadway; 213-623-3233; acehotel.com/losangeles) is in a 1927 Spanish Gothic structure that evokes classic Los Angeles. From about $199.|||What to Do|||The Los Angeles Conservancy (laconservancy.org) offers several walking tours on weekends, including separate Art Deco and Union Station tours each Saturday ($15).|||Correction: October 23, 2016, Sunday|||This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 9 about Art Deco Los Angeles quoted incorrectly from comments by the author Marlyn Musicant about the design of Union Station. She said that by utilizing bronze chandeliers, the architects wanted ''a more modern influence,'' not ''a more Spanish influence.''"
